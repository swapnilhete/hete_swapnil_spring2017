4fd25ae68eb7c8105d8078b1,"The Fair Trade Commission in Japan ruled on Tuesday that the Intel Corporation violated the country's antimonopoly law in the way it sold semiconductors and ordered the company to stop some of its sales practices. Intel took issue with the finding and said it was considering how to respond. The commission said Intel used unfair business practices to persuade five Japanese personal computer makers, including Sony and Toshiba, to stop or limit their purchases of microprocessors from two Intel rivals, Advanced Micro Devices and the Transmeta Corporation. The action against Intel came 11 months after the commission began its investigation with a raid on the company's Japanese offices. Fair trade authorities said that since May 2002, Intel offered discounts and incentives to computer makers that were contingent on promises that those companies either cease, or strictly limit, purchases from other chip makers. Intel said in a statement that it regarded its practices as fair and lawful. The company has 10 days to decide whether to appeal. If it does, the case would go through the commission's judicial review process. ''There is a broad consensus that competition regulators should only intervene where there is evidence of harm to consumers,'' D. Bruce Sewell, Intel's vice president and general counsel, said in the statement. ''It is apparent the J.F.T.C.'s recommendation did not sufficiently weigh these important principles.'' The ruling, which does not carry a fine, was the second action by Japanese competition regulators against a major American high-technology company in the last year. In July, the commission ordered Microsoft to remove a clause in its licensing contracts that was intended to protect it from patent suits. Intel has about 90 percent of the Japanese market for microprocessors, with the remainder split between Advanced Micro and Transmeta. That compares with an 80 percent market share for Intel worldwide. In the ruling, regulators did not ask Intel to stop offering volume discounts or other incentives to computer makers, but it did order the company to stop tying those discounts to promises to stop buying rival brands. In one case, Intel forced a computer maker to buy all of its semiconductors from Intel or lose rebates that had been offered, the commission said without identifying the manufacturer. Regulators argued that Intel's sales methods were unfair because the stipulations virtually assured that computer companies would severely limit purchases from rivals. Intel's brand power with consumers and its overwhelming market share in Japan mean computer makers have little choice but to buy a large number of their chips from Intel, and losing the discounts on those purchases would be costly, they said. The commission determined that Intel's practice limited competition and thus was likely to drive up the cost of computers for consumers, said Hiroshi Yamada, a commission official who briefed reporters on the decision. ''The company urged the five computer makers not to buy products from rivals in order to raise its own market share,'' Mr. Yamada said. The combined Japanese market share of A.M.D. and Transmeta dropped by more than half from 24 percent in 2002 to 11 percent in 2003, the commission said. Intel accounted for the remainder of the market, so its share rose to 89 percent from 76 percent in the period. A.M.D. has cited Intel's sales practices for its dwindling market share in Japan and applauded the ruling. ''It's a clear determination by the F.T.C. that Intel has been abusing a dominant position to limit competition,'' Thomas M. McCoy, executive vice president for legal affairs at A.M.D., said in an interview here.",Technology; Business,591,2005/03/09

The individual fibers in yarns are made of long polymer chains, or strands of giant molecules, according to Dr. Lemley, who is a chemist.

4fd1a75a8eb7c8105d6c2337,"Infant Immunity Q. Do immunizations of a pregnant woman give the infant any immunity when it is born? A. A pregnant woman can pass on some kinds of immunity, whether she has been immunized or not, said Dr. George P. Curlin, deputy director of the division of microbiology and infectious diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""These maternal antibodies are very powerful,"" he said, ""and babies are protected for several months."" That is why the measles vaccine is delayed until the age of 9 to 15 months, he said. At earlier ages, the antibodies interfere with the vaccine. ""We are actually doing research now to see if we can use vaccination or immunization of the mother to boost the immunity of babies,"" Dr. Curlin said. An infant's immune system does not protect against some infections early in life, he explained, though the pregnant woman's immune system does. Among the diseases are group B streptococcal diseases, which can cause meningitis in the first few weeks of life, hemophilus type B influenza and pneumococcal infections. Pneumococcus and hemophilus B vaccines already exist, he said, and researchers are studying how vaccines might cross the placenta into the fetus to confer immunity on the infant. The institute is taking a cautious approach to this maternal immunization program, he said, first seeking to determine if vaccines are safe in pregnancy. The Cat's Mouth Q. If a dog's mouth isn't any cleaner than a person's, what about a cat's? A. Whether dog, cat, human or cow, ""they are all probably pretty similar,"" said Dr. Edward C. Feldman, a veterinarian and professor of small animal internal medicine at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California at Davis. ""It's certain that there's not a whole lot of difference as far as bite wounds are concerned,"" he said. Mouths contain germs that can cause infections, he said, and it would be dangerous for a child to bite a cat as well as for a cat to bite a child. The cat's tongue, which is used for grooming, is not any cleaner or dirtier than a dog's tongue, he said, although it is scratchier because of the special structures that clean the fur.

4fd1b2368eb7c8105d6d516c,"Moon Rings Q. What does it mean when there is a ring around the Moon? A. ""Rain or snow is coming soon,"" said Lee Grenci, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pa. The rhyme is an accurate piece of folklore, he said, because high clouds typically streak out ahead of a fall or winter storm. This veil of wispy cirrus clouds, about 20,000 feet up, is mostly ice crystals that act like tiny prisms in the sky, he said. They refract or bend the light coming from the Moon or Sun, forming a halo. The Mohole Q. Whatever happened to the Mohole, the planned hole drilled down to the Moho, the boundary between the Earth's crust and mantle? A. The hole itself was never begun, but the idea proved the feasibility of shallower holes of the later Deep Sea Drilling Project, which proved the plate tectonics theory of the Earth's history, said Dr. Robert P. Meyer, professor of geophysics at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. The Mohole project ""lost the battle and gained the war,"" he said. The Mohole project was proposed in 1956. In 1961, the National Science Foundation chose a contractor, Brown & Root . The plan was to drill north and a little east of Hawaii, where the Moho is only about five and a half miles down, Dr. Myer said. About three miles of that was water, so only two and a half miles of drilling would have been required. The backers thought the big problem was holding the drilling vessel steady over the site, Dr. Meyer said. However, the problem of changing the drill bit and going back to the same hole at great depths might have stymied the effort, he said. Brown & Root proposed a two-deck drilling platform the size of a city block to ride high above the waves on six columns supported by two giant submarine hulls. The rig was to have been kept in place by thrusters in the columns. The keels for the hulls were laid, but rising costs and political controversy doomed the project. Estimates climbed from the original $5 million to $125 million. In August 1966, Congress cut off all funds. However, some valuable test holes were drilled from a smaller craft, the CUSS I. It was held in place with huge outboard motors controlled by readings from buoys moored to the bottom and used as echo-range reference points. These dynamic guidance principles were adapted for the Glomar Challenger vessel in the Deep Sea Drilling Project.",Technology; Science; Health,422,1990/11/13

Obsidian, a naturally occurring glass, is an igneous rock, said Dr. Ralph Moberly, a geologist in the department of geology and geophysics at the University of Hawaii, Honolulu.

It contains minerals like quartz and feldspar that could form crystals if left to themselves to cool slowly, but because it emerged and cooled so quickly, he said, ""there are few if any crystals in the substance."" As a matter of formal definition, rocks are any mineral matter making up the earth, including materials like sand, mud and clay, as well as the harder materials described as rock in everyday language. Nearly all rocks are made of minerals, sometimes several. Minerals are defined as solid substances made up of atoms with an orderly and regular arrangement. This orderly arrangement means that minerals can form crystals if left to pack and arrange themselves. It also means that it is possible to express the composition of a mineral as a chemical formula.

4fd19d7c8eb7c8105d6afcd1,"Sore Throat Relief Q. Why does gargling with salt water help soothe a sore throat? A. Properly mixed salt water is a normal physiological solution, said Dr. Howard L. Levine, an ear, nose and throat specialist in Cleveland. He said that gargling with a half teaspoon of salt mixed in a quart of lukewarm water bathes the mouth, temporarily washing away some bacteria, infected material and pus, which causes discomfort. Adding baking soda to the solution can help break up thick mucus. For severe sore throats, Dr. Levine recommends an equal mixture of hydrogen peroxide and antiseptic mouthwash. He said the hydrogen peroxide oxygenates the mouth, making it less friendly to bacteria. ""Gargling only helps for sore throats or other mouth infections,"" he said. ""It doesn't do any good if you have laryngitis, which is an inflammation of the voice box, because the liquid only reaches the back of the mouth."" Kitchen Chemistry Q. Why does gelatin gel? A. Gelatin is a tasteless, odorless, substance extracted by boiling collagen, a jellylike fibrous protein found in animal bones, tendons, hoofs and connective tissues. When dried gelatin is mixed in warm water, the fine-grained particles do not actually dissolve, but rather become evenly dispersed and remain suspended in the liquid, according to Dr. Robert H. Cox, a chemical consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y. When cooled to 95 degrees Fahrenheit and below, the gelatin particles absorb 5 to 10 times their weight in liquid, expanding into a coagulated semisolid state or gel, Dr. Cox said.

4fd1a7a78eb7c8105d6c297e,"Snakes in Ireland Q. Were there ever any snakes in Ireland for St. Patrick to throw out, as legend has it? A. There are no snakes in Ireland now, and no fossil records of snakes are known, said Dr. Charles W. Myers, curator of the herpetology department of the American Museum of Natural History. This does not prove that there were never any snakes, he said, because there is also no fossil record of the common lizard, which does occur in Ireland. ""But the presumption is that if there ever were any snakes,"" Dr. Myers said, ""they were exterminated by the last period of glaciation and have not been able to return."" The glaciers receded about 14,000 years ago. Ireland's cold climate is marginal for the survival of snakes, he said, although there are a few snakes farther north on the European mainland. Dr. Myers said that the few species of snakes that now live in England re-invaded after the last glaciers. There was once a land bridge between southwestern Scotland and Ireland, Dr. Myers said, but snake authorities believe it was severed before any snakes could get back to Ireland. It has been suggested that the legend of snake expulsion may have arisen because the non-Christian religion that St. Patrick threw out might have included forms of snake worship brought to Ireland from somewhere else. Moon on Horizon Q. Why is the Moon larger when it is close to the horizon? A. It is not actually larger, said Neil D. Tyson, an astrophysicist in the department of astronomy at Columbia University in New York, but seems larger because of an optical illusion. ""When the Moon is on the horizon,"" he said, ""it is seen next to buildings or trees, terrestrial items you are familiar with, and the juxtaposition of the two images changes depth cues."" You know the building is right in front of you, he explained, and the brain compensates by assuming the Moon disk is larger than it is when it is high in the sky, away from objects for comparison. At sea, where there are no buildings or trees, this illusion is absent because there are no cues to suggest it, he said. ""Another test is to look at the Moon between your legs upside down,"" Dr. Tyson suggested. ""All depth cues are completely thrown off, so the effect is lessened."" When the Moon is seen beside an upside-down tree, the tree is perceived as just a shape, he said, not a tree. It is possible to convince yourself that you have been fooled by an optical illusion by measuring the size of the Moon, Dr. Tyson said. The best way is to use a piece of paper carefully positioned on a window, tracing the the Moon once when it is near the horizon and again when it is at the top of the sky. The head must be lined up so it is exactly the same distance from the paper for both sightings, he said. The atmosphere does not have a significant magnifying effect on the Moon, Dr. Tyson said. ""If it does anything, it makes the full Moon appear slightly shallower from top to bottom, or slightly oval,"" he said.

4fd197ed8eb7c8105d6a6c5d,"Cats on TV Q. Do cats recognize cats on TV? A. There are some indications that cats might momentarily react to the images as cats, said Dr. Peter L. Borchelt, an animal behaviorist with Animal Behavior Consultants of Brooklyn. ""There is no doubt that cats can recognize movement on TV,"" he said. ""Some will look, come up and paw something moving on the screen."" Some cats appear to respond to video pictures of a bird the same way they do toward a bird seen out of the window, he added. They exhibit the same behaviors, like tooth chatter, a kind of stuttering stifled meow. If a silhouette of a cat in the hostile arched-back Halloween pose is hung on the wall at cat level, Dr. Borchelt said, some cats will, for a split second, interpret that outline as a cat and arch their own backs in response. If a silhouette with a neutral posture is used, a cat may sniff the rear end, though there is no odor difference. He said animals made the same kind of momentary perceptual errors that a human who tapped a store mannequin on the shoulder might make until it did not respond. Whispering Q. Does whispering strain the vocal cords more than trying to talk aloud when you have laryngitis? A. ""Whispering requires more effort than normal speech,"" said Dr. Robert F. Ward, assistant professor of otolaryngology at Cornell University Medical Center in New York. ""We believe it is equal to or more than yelling."" Laryngitis usually results from inflammation of the vocal cords from a viral infection. In whispering, the swollen vocal cords are forced nearly together without letting them meet. It is like lying down and trying to hold your feet a little way off the floor for a long time, Dr. Ward explained. He gave another analogy: ""It is not like softly plucking one string of a violin, but like trying to make the bow and the strings come very close together without touching.

4fd1c19b8eb7c8105d6f0ee4,"April Flowers Q. Why are so many early-blooming spring flowers yellow? A. At least in part because gardeners plant a lot of forsythia and daffodils and because yellow flowers are noticeable, botanists suggest. Deborah Kean, a botanist at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, said that yellow-flowered species were actually a minority of shrubs, early or late. And while many flowers of the composite family (those with a large calyx) are yellow, they often bloom later in the year, like the dandelion and goldenrod. What may be happening, she suggested, is that because yellow flowers reflect more light than any other color except white, they attract more attention, especially after a long flowerless winter. Color helps a flower attract its pollinators, she said, but that does not seem to be the main function. Yellow attracts bees, but so does blue, she noted. Animal Gourmets Q. How discriminating are the palates of wild animals? Do wolves wolf down their food because they can't taste it, for example? A. Animals' sensitivity to taste varies widely by species, said Dr. Robert Cook, chief veterinarian for the Bronx Zoo, but animals do have food preferences and many have taste buds. Animals also seek out food based on consistency, color and smell, he said. Certain snakes that have poor eyesight have powerful receptors for the heat of their prey and make their choices based on that, he said, and some animals seek out special nutrients. Because the diet of zoo animals like lions is prepared to provide certain levels of vitamins and minerals, their preferences are not the best guide to what a lion would eat in the wild, he said. ""That would usually be what they can catch,"" he said, ""small hoofed stock like antelopes, for example."" Animals may sense whether what they are about to eat is rotten, Dr. Cook said, but ""whether they will select against it, we don't necessarily know,"" he added. ""They usually prefer fresh."" As for wolves, Dr. Cook said, they are close relatives of the domestic dog, and it is assumed that their taste buds are somewhat similar. The gusto shown, however, ""depends on when they last ate.""",Technology; Science; Health,358,1991/04/02

4fd1a7a28eb7c8105d6c2649,"Survival of the Fattest? Q. Would obese people survive longer without food and water than skinny people? A. They probably would last longer without food, but not water, said Dr. James O. Hill, a physiologist and expert on obesity at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tenn. ""In a situation without food coming in, you use energy that is stored, and an obese person has more stored energy than a lean person,"" Dr. Hill said. ""However, an obese person would not last as long as you might think, because he uses that energy at a greater rate than a lean person."" More energy is required to maintain a larger body mass, he said. As for water, obese people would not really have an advantage because fat does not store much extra water. Polar Bears Q. Are polar bears happy in our zoos during the summer? A. It depends on the exhibit, said Rick Barongi, curator of mammals at the San Diego Zoo. He said polar bears are most comfortable in cold water or in the shade because their thick layer of fat retains heat. Also, their fur prevents heat from dissipating quickly. In San Diego, two polar bears, Bonnie and Caspar, live at the bottom of a shaded canyon and romp in water that averages 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit. ""It gets pretty hot even in Canada in the summer,"" he said. ""So the bears don't exert too much energy.""

4fd1b1608eb7c8105d6d38e6,"Banana Strings Q. What are the strings in a banana for? A. The prominent bundles running the length of a banana are part of the vascular system, expanding to carry nourishment while the banana develops and helping to strengthen the peel tissues, according to botanical reference works. By the time you peel a banana, however, their function is over and they shrink, leaving marks in the flesh. The banana is not a tree, but an overgrown herb. It grows from a rootlike rhizome, with buds along it somewhat like the eyes of a potato. Furled bundles of leaves ascend like a stem from these buds. Then a shoot grows up the center of the bundle, emerging as a flower bud that opens into a cascade of blossoms. Each female blossom is destined to develop into a banana. Sleep Before Midnight Q. Is it true that an hour of sleep before midnight is worth two hours of sleep after midnight? A. ""No, because sleep isn't that simple,"" said Dr. Charles Pollak, director of the Institute of Chronobiology and head of the Sleep-Wake Disorder Center of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center's Westchester division in White Plains, N.Y. In fact, he said, the hour of rising is probably much more important in keeping sleep cycles normal. Individuals go through a series of periods of rapid-eye-movement, or REM sleep, and non-REM sleep, Dr. Pollak said, and both kinds are needed. There is no evidence that you need more of one than the other, he said, but you do get most of the non-REM sleep in the first three to four hours of sleep and most of the REM sleep after that. Dr. Pollak said the amounts of different kinds of sleep are determined by when, within a sleep cycle, a person goes to bed and gets up. A human being's sleep cycles are also regulated by the amount of sleep needed over a period of several days, he said. Thus, sleep is regulated both by a system based on ""need"" for sleep and a system designed to keep the body's time in synchrony with the time of day, so that others are awake at the same time. ""This system allows animal life to coordinated with the environment, food sources and fellow animals,"" he said. The second half of the night is crucially important in setting the rhythm of sleep, Dr. Pollak said. ""Getting up in the morning is the most important act of the day that keeps our biological clocks keeping the right time,"" he said. ""It resets the clock.""",Technology; Science; Health,426,1990/10/23

4fd1970f8eb7c8105d6a4e4d,"Local Showers Q. How can it be raining cats and dogs on one side of the street and be dry, even sunny, on the other? A. The phenomenon is most likely to occur in northern latitudes in a pattern of summery weather, said Fred Gadomsky, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pa. It can result from what meteorologists call ""local forcing,"" where very small local weather patterns prevail over broader weather conditions, he said. In wintertime, Mr. Gadomsky explained, broad sweeps of warm air rise up over cold air, and the lifting mechanism creates clouds that rise until they are cool enough to precipitate the water vapor they are saturated with. In summer, however, warm humid air masses can create such clouds on a very local basis, Mr. Gadomsky said. ""The uneven heating between a blacktop parking lot and a nearby field can be enough to start air going up over the more strongly heated part of the landscape,"" he said, and the small area of upward-moving air is enough to lead to clouds and precipitation. Hay Fever Q. Do you actually run a fever with hay fever? A. In general, no, said Dr. Amy Lichtenfeld, a New York allergist. When a person encounters a substance that he or she is allergic to, mast cells release a substance called histamine, she said, and pure histamine won't cause fever. Some people with allergies might develop obstruction of sinus passages and a subsequent sinus infection with fever. Some people may also mistake a rhinovirus infection, a common viral cause of the common cold, for hay fever. In general, doctors are able to distinguish between sinus infections, viral rhinitis and hay fever, Dr. Lichtenfeld said. Dr. Michael Kaliner, who is head of allergic diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., said that historically hay fever has never been associated with fever, only with hay. It was first described in 1872 as ""autumnal catarrh,"" the nasal symptoms believed to be associated with the hay harvest, he said.

4fd1b1628eb7c8105d6d3a6e,"Green Mammals Q. If green is such a good camouflage color, why are there no green-colored mammals? A. Neither of those assumptions may be accurate, said James Doherty, general curator of the Bronx Zoo and chairman of the mammal department. In the first place, he said, ""Green is not necessarily all that good a camouflage color."" Unless it is very dark, he said, it may be more obvious than other colors. Most mammals are probably color blind, he said, so dark green would come across as black, but a lighter green, depending on the brightness of the color, would come across as gray. Depending on the background, a light-colored animal might be more obvious to some predators, even if it was green, he said. In the second place, Dr. Doherty said, there are some green or at least greenish mammals, including the green monkeys of Africa, which are a greenish-olive color, and a small South American rodent called the acouchi, a very dark animal with a greenish color. The green monkey is light in color, but it is not a deep-forest animal where a dark color would help it disappear, he said. Instead, it lives in an area with a lot of light and grass. ""But their predators probably don't see color anyway,"" Dr. Doherty said. Melanoma in Albinos Q. Can a human albino get melanoma? A. Sometimes, said Dr. John J. Di Giovanna, a dermatologist at the National Cancer Institute. He said there were at least 10 different types of albinism, or impairment of melanocytes, the skin cells that produce the pigment melanin. Most albinos do have melanocytes, even if they are not making pigment, he said. Albinos can develop a kind of melanoma called amelanotic melanoma, or melanoma in the absence of pigment. As long as melanyocytes are present, they can develop a malignancy that may be unrelated to the impairment of the function of making melanin, he said. And in some albinos, where the ability to make the pigment is impaired, rather than totally absent, melanomas with pigment can occur, he said.",Technology; Science; Health,345,1990/10/30

4fd1a71c8eb7c8105d6c1be0,"Q. How long do goldfish live? Is it true that they will grow bigger in a pond? Do they change color? A. The common aquarium goldfish, Crassius auratus, can live 30 years or more under ideal conditions, said Paul L. Sieswerda, curator of fishes and mammals at the New York Aquarium in Brooklyn. An aquarium limits their size, he said, but a pond lets them achieve their maximum growth. Some reach up to two feet in length. Goldfish often change color as they age and develop their full color patterns, Mr. Sieswerda said. In fact, one of the skills of goldfish breeders is to predict which fish are going to develop the best colors. Goldfish are closely related to the carp family and are quite hardy, he said. As long as the pond does not freeze over completely they can withstand very cold temperatures. Another pond fish, the koi, is even larger and more elaborate, Mr. Sieswerda said. It is very closely related to the wild carp, Cyprinus carpio, but has long been bred to achieve fantastic colors and shapes by fanciers in Japan, where prize fish are auctioned for large amounts of money.

4fd19ea08eb7c8105d6b1ba2,"Fly on the Wall Q. Why don't flies and ants fall off the ceiling? A. ""Looking at flies in terms of weight to volume, they don't weigh much, so very little force is required to keep a fly from falling,"" said Dr. Alex Mintzer, an entomologist with the Entomological Society of America in Lanham, Md. That force is exerted by structures on the tarsi, the tips of the fly's legs, he said. First, there is a set of claws, which can be seen with a very good hand magnifier. There are also spongy pads that have ridges like a ruffled potato chip, providing for greater contact or adhesion, he said. They are cushions, not suction cups. These body parts allow the fly to stay in place and move with confidence, Dr. Mintzer said. When the fly moves, two of its six legs can be out of contact with the surface at any time. Ants tend to rely more heavily on their claws, which are relatively larger than those of flies, than their pads, which are relatively smaller. ""Some are not as good at climbing as you might think,"" Dr. Mintzer said. ""Ants that live on the ground where the soil is rough might not be able to climb well on smooth surfaces or upside down,"" the way tree-dwelling ants do, he explained. ""The ones that get into houses, of course, usually have that ability,"" Dr. MIntzer said.

But computers are themselves altogether different. They talk in unpredictable dam bursts of information -- quiet one moment, then suddenly subjecting telephone lines to torrents. And these days, when some computers hold forth, it is like the Hoover Dam giving way, gushing out 134 million bits of data, or more, each second -- the equivalent of more than 80 copies of ""Moby Dick."" It takes six to eight bits, or binary digits, to create a byte; a byte is equivalent to a single typewritten character.",Technology; Business,1253,1991/11/13
4fd1c9958eb7c8105d6fcca7,"Through artificial insemination, a prize bull can father thousands of cows, passing along his superior genes to herds around the world. But the technique will not work for pork farmers, because pig sperm does not stand freezing, and artificial insemination is of limited use with horses, because horse sperm can be refrigerated only briefly. But now a Gulph Mills, Pa., company that specializes in commercializing biotechnology patents is working on a method of preserving sperm that requires no refrigeration. The company, British Technology Group USA, uses a polymer gel to encapsulate the sperm. At room temperature, the polymer solidifies, immobilizing the sperm and lowering their metabolic activity. The polymer is permeable, letting oxygen in and waste products out. Because it is encapsulated in the polymer, the sperm can be sent through the mail. In the case of cows and mice -- the only species for which the technology has been demonstrated so far -- the sperm can survive up to 21 days.",Business,391,1991/11/13

4fd1a75b8eb7c8105d6c23cc,"Researchers at the computer maker Next Inc. have developed a potent program that harnesses the unused computing power in a network of computers. Affectionately named Godzilla or just Zilla, the program permits users to break up the thorniest scientific and other computing problems into small parts and then runs them in parallel on unoccupied machines. Godzilla will take up residence on any computer in a network of Next work stations whose owner gives permission. It waits until the computer is not being used and then runs part of the problem. If the user returns and taps his or her keyboard, Godzilla has the manners to stop what it's doing and wait for the computer to be free again. Godzilla has already been used for a variety of mathematical explorations, like factoring very large numbers. Richard E. Crandall, a physicist who directs Next's scientific computation group, said many other uses were possible. Projects as diverse as quantum theory calculations, designing new medicines or creating high-resolution computer animations are possible. Taken by itself, each Next computer has the power of a scientific work station. Yet when harnessed together by Zilla, a group of Nexts can match the speed of a supercomputer on some problems. To define the scale of Godzilla, the Next researchers like to speak of one Zilla unit, or a Z.U., which is equivalent to the power of 100 Next work stations. The performance of one Z.U. is roughly equal to the speed of a Cray Y/MP computer, one of the world's fastest. Zilla is not confined to Next computers.

4fd199168eb7c8105d6a8f00,"The aluminum can has almost replaced the steel can for carbonated beverages. Now aluminum companies, helped by innovations just coming into wide use, are taking on the market for cans containing noncarbonated beverages and foods. Aluminum accounts for nearly 97 percent of the cans with carbonated beverages. But the metal was considered not sturdy enough to hold foods like juice, vegetables or tomato sauce. Ninety percent of canned food is packaged in steel. Aluminum beverage cans get their stability from the pressure exerted by the gas in their carbonated contents. To duplicate this effect with noncarbonated foods, the Reynolds Metals Company injects a drop of liquid nitrogen into aluminum cans before sealing to provide the pressure to keep them from being easily dented on supermarket shelves. Glenn M. Jost, director of quality assurance of the can division at Reynolds Metals, said cans with nitrogen now account for about 10 percent of the company's annual output of 10 billion cans. Reynolds developed the liquid-nitrogen technology about nine years ago. But Mr. Jost said production had intensified in the last two years as aluminum-can producers turned more attention to packaging noncarbonated drinks and foods. The Aluminum Company of America is developing aluminum food cans with ridges to provide the stability of steel cans. These cans are not yet available commercially, said John McMann, an Alcoa spokesman.

Not only has the quest for acoustical truth been squelched, but the very nature of the real sound world has been deconstructed and replaced by the elaborate artifice of the movie soundtrack.

4fd215b18eb7c8105d78f80f,"GREAT technology, David Gelernter argues in his new book, ''Machine Beauty: Elegance and the Heart of Technology'' (Basic Books), is beautiful technology. And the tragedy for a computer scientist like Mr. Gelernter, who is trying to design the next generation of personal computer software, is how ugly computer technology has become. Commercial software manufacturers, Mr. Gelernter argues, sell half-finished products, awaiting reports of system crashes and bugs the way potentates used to watch their dinnertime beta testers for signs of poisoning. New software is piled high with irrelevancies and distractions like children's collages of ''gaily painted macaroni'' smelling of Elmer's Glue. ''How,'' he asks, ''did ugliness manage to dominate the game for so long?'' How could a beautiful machine like Apple's Macintosh, for example, ever have taken second place to the cloddish design of MS-DOS? And now that Microsoft has adopted Apple's design in Windows, why is it, in its marred form, finally acceptable? These are not minor matters. Mr. Gelernter considers beauty to be an essential part of the computer revolution; it is, ideally, ''a happy marriage of simplicity and power.'' Right now, he said, both simplicity and power are sadly lacking. For Mr. Gelernter, who teaches at Yale University developing new computer technologies (see www.cs.yale.edu/HTML/YALE/CS/Linda/linda.html) and is the art critic for the Weekly Standard magazine, the failure is partly cultural. He believes that art education should be required for software designers (and everyone else). And he attributes the success of PC ugliness to an American discomfort with elegance. But profligate ugliness in the computer world may stem from the unusual nature of these machines, compared with their mechanical forebears, and the ways that notions of simplicity and power quickly shift ground in PC technology. Despite the ugliness of DOS, for example, when the I.B.M. PC was first released it seemed extraordinarily beautiful. The green-glowing classic font on those early screens engraved the words in elegant light. The etched circuit board was almost miraculous: unchanging, unmoving, yet capable of unimagined deeds and unexplored powers. Apart from designers and desktop publishers, who needed the graphics or varied fonts provided by the Macintosh? Far from seeming elegant, those accouterments seemed frivolous, ornamental, distracting to an average user. The power and simplicity of that first I.B.M. may have been still more affecting for this user, who, a decade or so earlier was working with its ancestor (an I.B.M. 360/44), lifting large-plattered disks into waist-high disk drives, loading reels of tapes into Stonehenge-like pillars, and laboring to instruct a mainframe to respond, bit by bit, to the movements of a light pen on a screen. At the time, that machine, its tapes whirring, was sternly beautiful. But notions of simplicity and power change in the fluid world of the PC. What seems ugly now, was once beautiful; what is barely functional was once extraordinary. But Mr. Gelernter is still right. Now that the PC has become commonplace, its ugliness is everywhere more apparent, failing by its own standards and in comparison with the great models of machine beauty Mr. Gelernter invokes: the Hoover Dam, the J3 steam locomotive and the 1937 ebony desk phone. These are objects from the 1930's that are monuments to technology, declaring in their design, the immense scope of their achievement. Even that telephone's imposing weight and pyramidal shape bespoke its importance. That kind of machine beauty also shared something with more intimate examples of mechanical design ranging from early Victrolas to mechanical clocks. In these objects, part of the beauty is in the meticulous connections. Everything is fitted, proportions meshing, achieving something that would have once been considered magical. Electronic objects are different: their beauty comes less from the proportions of the parts than the power of their results. There is no way to appreciate proportion in the PC; nothing moves; size is irrelevant; design is unrelated to achievement. The promise, according to Mr. Gelernter, is in software, which really must be thought of as a ''virtual machine'' that remakes the PC in its own image. The program interface is a way of ordering the cyberworld; if finely wrought, it has -- as Steven Johnson, the editor of Feed (www.feed.com) has argued -- an esthetic dimension. Mr. Gelernter is lobbying for a ''virtual machine'' he has helped develop, called Lifestreams. In the book and on his corporate World Wide Web site (www.lifestreams.com), he explains it as a replacement for current methods of operating PC's. A lifestream would become a visible array of one's life work, its objects retrieved the way one retrieves memories. Despite the site's brief demo, the idea seems hard to pin down, but the ambition is to leave behind the material world of the desktop metaphor. Instead, one would navigate in an ''information sea.'' It might work. But the real question is: How beautiful will it be?",Technology; Business; Books,804,1998/02/09

4fd1c3d18eb7c8105d6f313c,"Scientists have tinkered for years with keeping plants alive outside the soil by bathing them in a nutrient-rich mist, a technology known as aeroponics. Now, one modest business and one potentially big one may be emerging from the work of Pamela Weathers, a biotechnology professor at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and Kenneth Giles, the former head of her department. Through the Manostat Corporation of New York, the scientists are marketing a small device that they say can markedly improve the productivity of plants grown by researchers from small clumps of cells called tissue cultures. The Mistifier uses an ultrasonic transducer, similar to the device that creates mist in many home humidifiers, to turn a small, computer-controlled reservoir of plant nutrients into a mist. The mist is forced down a silicon tube network, carried by gas pumped by a standard aquarium aerator, onto the tissue cultures. In trials, the Mistifier tripled the number of shoots produced by banana cell cultures, and cultures from one ornamental plant produced 20 times more shoots. The length of the shoots in various plants was four to six times greater, and the contamination rate was also sharply lower. The Mistifier's commercial potential will be enhanced if Bio Rational Technology, the company founded by the professors, finds a way to increase the machine's capacity. Timber companies and commercial plant growers would want to produce thousands, or tens of thousands, of cultures at once. The technology's greatest promise may be as a means of extracting chemicals that can now be retrieved only by harvesting the plant. Professor Weathers said research suggested that the Mistifier's capacity to alter temperatures, nutrients and atmosphere might change that. The goal is to stimulate the growth of cell-culture root systems that produce the chemicals, change conditions to trick the roots into secreting the chemicals, and then return to the baseline growing conditions, encouraging the plant to restore its normal balance by producing more of the substances it released. ""Our goal is to turn plants into continuous producers,"" Professor Weathers said, comparing the current approach to killing a sheep each time one wants to obtain wool.",Business,354,1990/11/28

Tantamount to what Hollywood executives might call going straight to video, the author will publish his latest work, ''Ambush at Fort Bragg,'' as a 180-minute audio track on cassette tape and CD. The audio book, expected to retail for $21.95 on tape and $24.95 on CD, is being supported by a $150,000 marketing campaign -- high for the audio book industry.",Business; Books,173,1997/07/28

But their rush to carve the Internet into multimedia fiefs is siphoning energy away from what should be the goal: to help users and developers exploit the unique, interactive qualities of the World Wide Web. ''There's a strange set of priorities right now,'' says Steven Johnson, editor of the Web magazine Feed (www.feedmag.com), who thinks that the focus of the two companies is misplaced.",Technology; Business,927,1996/08/26
4fd1d3df8eb7c8105d71076b,"IN the last two years, hundreds of pioneering radio broadcasters, from ABC News to the cyberstation KPIG, have begun making their programming available over the Internet. But so far, listening to your computer via the Net has been much like listening to shortwave radio. A tinny speaker emits static-filled broadcasts that seem to come from the other side of the Atlantic. The main problem has been the restricted bandwidth -- or network circuit capacity -- available to most Internet users. But now software technology from the two leading Internet audio and video suppliers and from two newcomers to the field promises much clearer sound with standard 28,800-bits-per-second modems and regular phone lines. And with the much faster I.S.D.N., or integrated services digital network, modems now on the market, as well as the cable television modem connections available in some parts of the country, the sound quality can approach that of compact disk audio.",Technology; Business,891,1996/08/12

The center -- which had been housed nearby in tighter quarters -- now has 10 permanent exhibition halls with hands-on displays that examine the natural, physical and mathematical sciences, as well as applied technology, including computer simulation and laser optics. The centerpiece is a 7,000-square-foot exhibit called NatureWorks, in which Florida's various ecosystems are represented in simulated settings. For example, the Cypress Swamp, housed in a towering atrium and teeming with alligators, snapping turtles and Florida bass, demonstrates how a swamp stores and filters water.",Technology; Science,231,1997/03/09
4fd1c85a8eb7c8105d6faf85,"To the Editor: Lawrence Krauss (Op-Ed, July 29) does a disservice to the public and to the scientific community to argue that ''a theory whose predictions fail the test of experiment is always wrong, period.'' Far from it. This argument, known in the jargon of philosophy of science as ''naive methodological falsificationism,'' is indefensible. Social scientists are familiar with debates that ensue when a theory fails to predict accurately. Do we junk the theory after a single prediction failure? Of course not. The theory may indeed be wrong. But it may also be that we did not derive the predictions accurately from the theory. Or we made mistakes in measuring the data. Or the experiment was poorly constructed, so that it was not a definitive test. Or perhaps we have run into unexplained variance, since no theory explains everything all the time.",Opinion,250,1996/08/01

Hearing the denunciations at this meeting, one might guess that distinguishing truth lovers from truth defiers is child's play. The forces of rationality sport shiny white jump suits, like the hero of ""Toy Story,"" while the epistemological subversives skulk about in black T-shirts and berets. If only things were that simple. Like a mutant virus, postmodernism has infected not only philosophy and the social sciences but even such alleged bastions of truth and objectivity as physics and chemistry. Some of the most prominent scientists in the world traffic in hypotheses that are remarkably postmodern in character. I like to call this type of theorizing ironic science.",Opinion,1225,1996/07/16
