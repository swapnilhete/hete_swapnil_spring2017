Plates of blackened catfish Caesar salad, catfish in a crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e and Southern-fried catfish lay between us, as did a P.R. folder embossed with the phrase ''U.S. Farm-raised Catfish: Safety You Can Trust.'' As the North American catfish's principal advocate, Barlow wanted to focus on the positive. He described how U.S. catfish adhered to the world's toughest quality standards; how, in their farm-raised form, catfish weren't scavengers, as in nature, but rather sweet-tasting surface-feeders, raised in well water and fattened on corn and soy. But by and by our discussion reached a point at which Barlow revealed some impending changes. Very soon U.S. farm-raised catfish, some of it anyway, would not be called catfish. 'The name we have chosen, and the name we have market-tested,'' he said, pausing slightly, ''is Delacata.'' Delacata, he explained, was going to be a specially filleted Grade-A piece of the best of the farmed North American channel catfish. It was being tested at high-end bistros in California, and the ''Iron Chef America'' judge Cat Cora had signed on to endorse it.", "headline": {"kicker": "THE FOOD ISSUE", "main": "A Catfish By Any Other Name"}, "_id": "4fd27e138eb7c8105d846a7d", "web_url": "http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDB1430F931A25753C1A96E9C8B63", "keywords": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Lots of restaurants send newsletters to their customers.
