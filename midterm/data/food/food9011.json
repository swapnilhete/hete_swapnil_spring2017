Place the meat in a deep bowl, add the white wine and vinegar and allow to marinate six to eight hours. 2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 3. Remove the meat from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and pat the beef dry. Heat the oil in a heavy three-quart casserole. Add the beef and brown it on all sides. Remove the meat from the casserole and add the onions and carrots and cook over medium-low heat until tender and lightly browned. Stir in the garlic, then add the raisins, ginger, allspice and brown sugar. Add the stock, the reserved marinade and the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan. Stir in the bay leaves and salt and pepper to taste. Return meat to casserole. 4. Cover the casserole and place in the oven. Bake for about two hours, until the meat is tender. 5. To serve, remove the meat from the casserole and slice it. Arrange on a platter. Reheat the sauce and check seasoninings. Add some or all the lemon juice if the sauce does not seem tart enough. Spoon some of the hot sauce over the meat and pass the rest. 6. Alternatively, the meat can be refrigerated overnight in the cooking liquid and the next day the meat can be sliced and the sauce reheated before serving. This will improve the meat's flavor and texture and allow the layer of chilled fat on liquid's surface to be removed and discarded.
