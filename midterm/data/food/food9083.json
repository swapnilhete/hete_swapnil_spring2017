Reservations can be made by calling (718) 624-0890. Some tickets will be sold at the door. The society is situated at 128 Pierrepont Street (at Clinton Street) in Brooklyn Heights. No More Wine Drips Some people serve white wine with everything because it does not stain the tablecloth. But now they can safely pour some merlot with a steak. Drop Stop, a new gadget created in Denmark, prevents wine from dripping from the bottle as it is poured. It consists simply of a flexible disk of silvered plastic that can be curved and fitted into the neck of any wine bottle. It works. And it can be reused. A card with three Drop Stop disks is $3.95. Postage for each order is $2. It can be ordered from Hill Marketing, P.O. Box 2323, Oakland, Calif. 94614. Decorating With Chefs What the Ballroom, the restaurant that was once on West Broadway (and is now at 253 West 28th Street), did for the art world with its giant mural portraying SoHo art personalities, the Chefs Cuisiniers Club, 36 East 22d Street, is doing for chefs with a painting by Mark Hess showing famous chefs and restaurateurs. The painting, being unveiled tomorrow evening, was commissioned by Charles Palmer, an owner of the restaurant. The 9-by-4 1/2-foot work was done in a style that combines elements of the Italian Renaissance with carefully wrought details of Dutch and Flemish masters and contemporary American photorealists. It's as eclectic as today's food. The 10 figures in the mural represent Mr. Palmer's personal pantheon. Legends like Marie-Antoine Careme and Auguste Escoffier, French notables like Paul Bocuse, Georges Blanc, Alain Ducasse and Pierre Troisgros are represented, as are the late Jean Troisgros and Alain Chapel. Wolfgang Puck from California and Sirio Maccioni of Le Cirque in Manhattan are also in the painting. Prefab Gingerbread December may be a good month for housing starts in the gingerbread sector. This year, there are a number of choices in ready-made, ready-to-be-made and do-it-yourself models.

Nationwide Zagat THIS year, in addition to its annual pocket-size survey of New York restaurants, the Zagat Survey has published a pair of guides to restaurants in cities nationwide. One lists the top restaurants in each of 29 major cities. The other covers restaurants offering the best value in 22 cities. The data in the nationwide surveys were complied from individual surveys done within the last two years in each of the cities. Tim Zagat, the publisher, said editors in each city had also verified the information. These guides are $12.95 each in bookstores or by calling (800) 333-3421, and are handy for travelers. The 1993 New York City survey, listing 1,248 restaurants, is also in bookstores, for $9.95.", "headline": {"main": "Food Notes"}, "_id": "4fd1b7ea8eb7c8105d6dee4f", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/09/garden/food-notes-846092.html", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "FOOD NOTES (TIMES COLUMN)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "A HISTORY OF FOOD   By Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat.

As might be expected, the reckless idyll ends disastrously. But within months the family has become fabled among other homeless people as the ones who lived at Disneyland. This is the fanciful but grim beginning of Jane Anderson's \"Food and Shelter,\" at the Vineyard Theater. At the outset Ms. Anderson sets her polarities: the magical though manufactured kingdom against the dreariness of those whose only residence is a car and whose life is otherwise circumscribed by food stamps and soup kitchens.
