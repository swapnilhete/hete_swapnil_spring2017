Stop and Shop will then have 192 stores, mostly in New England and the northern suburbs of New York City. Edwards and Giant will be merged into one company but will keep their store names. Edwards will take over the 16 Mel's supermarkets owned by Stop and Shop on Long Island.

The doors open at 9 A.M. for members of the institute, at 11 A.M. for others, and will remain open until 5 P.M. Cutting Cookware Prices Chantal Cookware, a line of heavy, brightly enameled pots, pans and kettles, will be sold at deep discounts during a factory sale tomorrow through Sunday at the Radisson Hotel Englewood, 401 South Van Brunt Street, off Route 4 in Englewood, N.J., near the George Washington Bridge.

Roll Out the Barrel New York is turning into an Octoberfest, with beer events, beer dinners at restaurants and beer benefits. One of the most elaborate is the New York Beerfest sponsored by the Fund for the Borough of Brooklyn, on Sunday from noon to 7 P.M. on the esplanade under the Brooklyn side of the Brooklyn Bridge and in the adjoining Empire-Fulton State Park. More than 50 breweries will offer information and samples. Beer-friendly food will be served. Tickets are $20 in advance from Ticketmaster, (212) 307-7171. At the door they are $25. Pub-Crawl Guide \"The Insider's Guide to Manhattan Bars\" by Eric Zicklin (Citadel Press, $7.95) is a pocket-size directory that sums up the drinking scenes in hundreds of bars and restaurants. Whether your taste runs to black leather jackets or three-piece suits, to romance or blaring rock music, you will probably find listings of places with like-minded drinkers. The guide groups the bars by location, describes the decor and indicates prices. Chilis con Carnival With beer? Chilis of course, and in Brooklyn, too. On Sunday from 10 A.M. to 4:30 P.M., the Brooklyn Botanic Garden is celebrating chili peppers with a multi-ethnic festival that includes lectures, cooking and gardening demonstrations, music, dance, crafts and food from places where chilis are king, like South America, Thailand, Mexico, the Caribbean and the American Southwest. The event is free, and food will be sold in the Terrace Cafe from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. Scrutable Asian Cuisine Kelley & Ping, a new Asian grocery store at 127 Greene Street, near Houston Street, is the brainchild of Brad Kelley and Lee Ping, who are aiming to make Asian ingredients and equipment more easily understandable for non-Asians. They also want to offer a taste of the colorful, raffish market atmosphere typical in Asian countries. \"We're selling a selection of products from China, Japan, Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, and we have people who can explain them,\" said Mr. Kelley, who with Ms. Ping also owns Kin Khao, a Thai restaurant on Spring Street. At the store, packaged foods, including soy sauce, vinegar, cooking wine, rice, noodles, seaweed, spices, tea and candy are displayed on dark wood shelves. Prices are closer to those of Chinatown than at Dean & DeLuca nearby. For example, a 21-ounce bottle of excellent Pearl River soy sauce is $1.85. Five chefs turn out soups, noodle dishes, Asian-style sandwiches, salads and so on, to eat in or take out. A copious and delicious bowl of duck broth, with pieces of duck, noodles and vegetables is $5.95. The store is open from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. every day.
