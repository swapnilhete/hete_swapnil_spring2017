This new menu movie has a soapy plot, appealing stars, family values, down-home atmosphere and a conviction that there's rarely a problem fried chicken can't cure. There sure are worse ways of looking at the world than that. The chicken, shown in loving close-up almost as frequently as the film's leading ladies are, is a regular feature at Sunday dinner for the Chicago family headed by Mother Joe (Irma P. Hall). Ditto for cornbread and fried catfish and black-eyed peas. Over this elaborate feast, Mother Joe dispenses kindly wisdom (''See, soul food cookin' is about cookin' from the heart'') and referees the arguments of her three daughters and their husbands. These couples have enough colorful troubles to give the movie a full plate.", "headline": {"kicker": "FILM REVIEW", "main": "Fried Chicken With Soul Sees a Family Through"}, "_id": "4fd1d7e78eb7c8105d715f8f", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/26/movies/film-review-fried-chicken-with-soul-sees-a-family-through.html", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "SOUL FOOD (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "TILLMAN, GEORGE JR"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "WILLIAMS, VANESSA L"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "To the Editor:   The National Cancer Institute's decision to drop its recommendation that women under 50 have regular mammograms is misguided public health policy (news article, Dec. 5)....", "section_name": "Opinion", "print_page": "16", "abstract": null, "type_of_material": "Letter", "subsection_name": null, "pub_date": "1993-12-13T00:00:00Z", "word_count": 468, "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "byline": null, "multimedia": [], "blog": [], "lead_paragraph": "To the Editor: The National Cancer Institute's decision to drop its recommendation that women under 50 have regular mammograms is misguided public health policy (news article, Dec. 5).", "headline": {"main": "An Unwise Policy Change on Mammography"}, "_id": "4fd1bf1b8eb7c8105d6ecc66", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/13/opinion/l-an-unwise-policy-change-on-mammography-874593.html", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CITRON, RONALD"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "STANDARDS AND STANDARDIZATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BREAST"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CANCER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WOMEN"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "LEAD:    Celebrating the Harvest...", "section_name": "Home and Garden", "print_page": "4", "abstract": null, "type_of_material": "News", "subsection_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-10-17T00:00:00Z", "word_count": 669, "news_desk": "Living Desk", "byline": {"person": [{"rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "Fabricant", "organization": "", "firstname": "Florence"}], "original": "By Florence Fabricant"}, "multimedia": [], "blog": [], "lead_paragraph": "LEAD: Celebrating the Harvest", "headline": {"main": "FOOD NOTES"}, "_id": "4fd1c10f8eb7c8105d6f0112", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/17/garden/food-notes-072790.html", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "FOOD NOTES (TIMES COLUMN)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Recipes From Clinton    The Clinton Community Garden, a cooperative effort on West 48th Street between Ninth and 10th avenues, was started in 1978 by residents of the neighborhood, formerly known as Hell's Kitchen.
