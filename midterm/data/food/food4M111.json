Like their cousins, p\u00e2te de fruits (fruit jellies), these jewel-toned, sugary squares have intense flavors, but with beet, red pepper, fennel and carrot replacing the usual passion fruit and black currant. Imported from France, they are made using the same technique as Fauchon's p\u00e2te de fruits, substituting vegetables that are naturally high in sugar. While beet, with its magenta hue, is the most striking, the red pepper is the eye-opener. Tangy, ripe and spicy, with a dried-apricotlike vibrancy, it makes you wonder why red peppers are not used more often in desserts.
