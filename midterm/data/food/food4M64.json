''How to Cook and Eat in Chinese,'' by Buwei Yang Chao, was, as far as I can discover, the first successful attempt to provide an authentic rather than Westernized Chinese cookbook. It includes more than 200 recipes, with a sophisticated introduction to Chinese culinary culture that covers ingredients, techniques, politesse, terms and tools. Chao's recipes are still accurate and easily mastered, and her commentary remains fresh and informative. And with her help, I created my own polyglot improvisations long before fusion became the fashion. The author explains, for example, that ''chopsticks'' -- k'uai-t -- means ''something fast,'' as in a rude tourist ordering the waiter to ''chop-chop''; ''small meals between meals'' are called tien-hsin, or dot hearts, literally something to dot (touch) the heart. These are now, of course, transliterated as dim sum, though when they first became popular with New Yorkers, they were called tea lunch, because, as the author explains, the Chinese typically do not drink tea with their three regular meals but only with their dot hearts.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Chinese Characters"}, "_id": "4fd2a1eb8eb7c8105d887131", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/13/magazine/food-chinese-characters.html", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "CHAO, BUWEI YANG"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "CHAO, YUEN REN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "When I found out that La C\u00f4te Basque was closing its doors, I was sad -- irrationally so, since it later occurred to me that I hadn't actually eaten there in almost 14 years.

I remember the occasion clearly because it was the birthday of my ex-fianc\u00e9, almost a year to the date that I sort of, more or less, left him at the altar. Still guilt-ridden (but happily about to leave New York for an extended stay in New Orleans), I thought I should create a celebration, one in which we'd emphasize his birthday rather than my departure and finally close the door on what was left of our relationship. So I assembled my own version of Capote's swans, those chic society ladies like Babe Paley and Gloria Guinness; mine were Joan Buck, Kathleen Tynan and my childhood friend M.T. -- and they did not let me down. We hauled out all our jewels and finery (I wore a black Chanel suit, my first), picked up the birthday boy in a Town Car and spent the rest of the night lavishly fussing over him -- and drinking, a lot. We started with Champagne and caviar and the excellent foie gras terrine and progressed through many bottles of Puligny-Montrachet to those chocolate and Grand Marnier souffl\u00e9s you had to order ahead of time. When the bill arrived, I didn't flinch -- the entire evening had been a triumph of sophisticated merriment. Looking back on it, the entire evening, or at least the thinking behind it, seems more like a triumph of insanity. I had obviously lost my mind. But somehow the restaurant itself made the occasion less bizarre, O.K. even, with all the cosseting and the red banquettes, the completely charming captains with their occasional raised eyebrows and knowing almost-smiles, the perfect choreography of waiters and busboys and sommeliers that made you feel as if they existed only to do your bidding even though the room was, thankfully, packed.

What I was not prepared for was the food. It is delicious. My Vogue colleague Alexandra Kotur and I were there to cover the Kabul Beauty School, an enterprise that sounded, even to us, not just a little frivolous. But it turns out that beauty salons had been among the few small businesses owned and operated by women before the Taliban gained power, and during the regime, women literally risked their lives to run clandestine salons in their houses.

Now there are very few things I don't like, but employing our theory I have made uninteresting things taste far livelier. The ever present mini-bottle of Tabasco in my purse has gotten me through more airplane meals and rubber-chicken dinners than I can count.

For instance, now that the buffoon season is over and there are no more awards or (worse) awards shows until the billions of Emmys show up again in the fall, my easily appalled friend Jocko lays out his cards. When Jocko told me that giving the Tony to as pedestrian a show as ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'' mocks the prize and makes it meaningless as a symbol of quality because enough voters are theater owners and roadshow presenters who are not going to take a show called ''Urinetown'' on the road despite its superior originality and smarts, why those, of course, are only Jocko's taste buds, not yours or anyone else's. Similarly, your broker's recommendation to buy or sell AOL Time Warner is only one person's opinion. And one woman's hunk will be another's brute. So if I tell you that the food at a hotel in Las Vegas modeled after the city of Venice is considerably better than any of the food in Venice itself, that's only my opinion -- even though in this case it's right. And if I add that the food in that Italian city is the most mediocre and overpriced in the world (not the worst -- that belt is still comfortably worn by Shea Stadium), well, that again is entirely subjective.

It cuts across regional lines (unlike say, gumbo, which is enjoyed in other states but does not retain the same exalted rank outside Louisiana, or pilau, which is relatively unheard of beyond South Carolina). It can also be the subject of intense debate. For example, should the chicken be marinated overnight in milk and seasonings before being coated with flour, or simply washed and dried and coated with seasoned flour? And what should the seasonings be? Also, what should the chicken be fried in, lard or oil? Most cooks I know have passionate, unequivocal answers to these questions. And just about everybody I know has his or her own highly personal benchmark, the standard against which all other fried chicken must be measured. For my friend Rick Smythe, it's the chicken at Fratesi's, a store on Highway 82 near Tribbett, Miss., where they've been frying chicken at least as long as Rick has been alive. There the chicken is soaked in a mixture of milk and water, coated in flour seasoned with onion salt, garlic salt, Season-All and black pepper and fried in oil. Last time I was home, Rick insisted I try it, so I sampled four pieces until there was nothing left but bones.
