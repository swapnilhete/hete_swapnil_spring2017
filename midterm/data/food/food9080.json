And to the amazement of virtually everyone in town -- including the two antagonists -- the issue is set to go before a Los Angeles Superior Court judge and jury on Nov. 18.

Mr. Eisner's lawyers have responded that ''Katzenberg is simply not entitled to the enormous sums of money he now demands,'' largely because he waived his right to future bonuses when he left his job in 1994 instead of two years later.", "headline": {"main": "At the Movies; A Studio Drama In a Real Court"}, "_id": "4fd1e25b8eb7c8105d72afa8", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/19/movies/at-the-movies-a-studio-drama-in-a-real-court.html", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "SOUL FOOD (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KRAMER, STANLEY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KATZENBERG, JEFFREY"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "TILLMAN, GEORGE JR"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "EISNER, MICHAEL"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DIRECTORS GUILD"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DISNEY, WALT, CO"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BLACKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SUITS AND LITIGATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CONTRACTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AWARDS, DECORATIONS AND HONORS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BONUSES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Taste of Harlem     On Saturday and Sunday from 11 A.M. to 7 P.M., soul, Caribbean, African and creole cuisines will be among those sampled, for a fee, at Taste of Harlem, part of Harlem Week.
