When Elena Castaneda, who owned a dress shop on the Upper East Side, teamed up with Steven Hanson, who owns Park Avalon, Isabella's and Coconut Grill, to open a bakery, she wanted to emphasize low-fat confections. The result, Madison Avenue's Honest Bakery, 1006 Madison Avenue (78th Street), opened yesterday. Ms. Castaneda worked for two years with the chef, Craig Rutman, to develop the likes of the Chocolate Decadence Cake ($20), which tastes decadent indeed but has only 200 calories a serving, 30 percent of them from fat; homey blueberry crumb cake ($20), with 330 calories a slice but only 11 percent of them from fat, and an intense brownie ($2.50), 210 calories, a mere 12 percent of them from fat.", "headline": {"main": "Food Notes"}, "_id": "4fd1f2a08eb7c8105d74a3ab", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/14/garden/food-notes-566695.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Sweets at F.A.O.
