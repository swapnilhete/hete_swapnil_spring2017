Most of us, alas! don't have quite such a well-stocked larder or the time to prepare platters of elaborate hors d'oeuvres. I find that hot crostini always go down well with guests, whether they are drinking Cristal rose or a glass of beer. Crostini (little toasts) are popular in Italy, where stale bread does not automatically find its way into the bird feeder, or worse still, out with the trash. Instead, day-old bread is often toasted and used as a base for snacks made with various toppings. I like to combine goat cheese with sun-dried tomatoes and black-olive paste for an easy, last-minute hors d'oeuvre, which is put under the broiler and served hot. A good Vermont or English cheddar cheese also makes excellent crostini, combined with a dash of mustard. The clean, tart flavor of green-olive paste (available at specialty stores) complements prosciutto and mozzarella to make crostini that go well with wine.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Crostini With Cheese and Olive Paste for Tasty Party Snacks"}, "_id": "4fd1ea838eb7c8105d73a1e8", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/02/nyregion/food-crostini-with-cheese-and-olive-paste-for-tasty-party-snacks.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Cooking can be guided more by smell and taste and feel than by precise measure.

Carol Field, in her excellent new book, \"Italy in Small Bites\" (William Morrow), gives a recipe for dried fava beans, which are pureed and mixed with wild greens. The nutty flavor of the favas makes a splendid foil for the bitterness of the greens. If you can't find wild greens, broccoli rape, escarole, frisee or chicory can be substituted.
