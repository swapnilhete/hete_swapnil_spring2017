By April, the sun lingers long enough to pop the dogwood blossoms and coaxes the hopeful aroma of brine and bait and new eelgrass into the air. But the sun doesn't stick around long enough to rouse the blue crabs from their winter burrow in the crab grounds that run north from Tangier Island in Virginia to the eastern shore of Maryland. \"Like as never ta git here,\" is how the local watermen discuss the arrival of the warm season and the molting crabs it brings. James Michener called soft-shell crabs \"the tastiest morsel in the bay.\" As perishable as the Chesapeake spring is impetuous, soft-shell crabs remained a regional delicacy until the railroad carried them north to Philadelphia and New York in the early 19th century, eventually turning a sideline business into a full-scale industry.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Bay Bounty"}, "_id": "4fd1b2768eb7c8105d6d5a46", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/17/magazine/food-bay-bounty.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CRABS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FISH AND OTHER MARINE LIFE"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "ALTHOUGH this winter was one of the warmest on record, it is now officially spring.

Grilled tuna is teamed with pinto beans, sauteed skate with white beans instead of the usual boiled potato and salmon with black beans flavored with fresh coriander. No longer are beans a winter food to be cooked with the traditional ham hock and served on the coldest days. Navy beans, flageolets or soissons are delicious stewed and served as a side dish with grilled or roasted fish. Kidney beans have a wonderful rustic flavor that goes with game.
