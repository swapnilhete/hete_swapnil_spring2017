The elite never admitted to eating them, but everybody cool did, from Jughead (America's first slacker) in the Archie comics to Kerouac and Cassady. Hot dogs were nowheresville, eaten only by baseball umpires. In the semi-holy war of hamburgers versus hot dogs, you could choose your friends by their preference: burgers were for winners, dogs were for also-rans. Yankee fans ate burgers (though not at the stadium), Dodger fans ate hot dogs.

Why or even how this of all possible arrangements should exist defies ordinary human understanding. But it is plain to see that in the great game of survival every living thing must eat in order to replicate itself and so sustain the precarious grip of its species on its place in nature. What strong desires impel this behavior among the lesser sentient creatures we can only imagine. We may assume, however, that these other living things, unlike ourselves, rely upon instinct to moderate their hunger and lust, for unregulated desire means conflict and eventual extinction. But for us, when we encounter a pretty face or fowl, the moderating instinct is not nearly as dependable, if dependable at all. Hence our collective willingness, older than recorded time, to rely upon priests, magistrates and sacred texts to govern our appetites: a survival strategy embedded in our laws and rituals and known as civilization, a strategy that our fellow creatures, governed by instinct, can forgo. Of the modern holidays erected upon the relics of ancient rites, by which we still celebrate the rebirth of the sun at the winter solstice; spare the gravid ewes when we say farewell to meat at carne vale; rejoice in the resurrection of the fields at Easter; and tremble at nature's deathlike sleep in autumn, the celebration of eros occurs in mid-February, when, according to Geoffrey Chaucer, ''[it] was on seynt Volantynys day Whan euery byrd comyth there to chese his make,'' instinct telling them that the lengthening days will soon be mild enough to sustain new life, hence the chicks and bunnies of our own Easter holiday.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Sexy Feast"}, "_id": "4fd2146d8eb7c8105d78c7fe", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/10/magazine/food-sexy-feast.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "VALENTINE'S DAY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Does art matter?
