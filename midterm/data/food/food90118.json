But certain guidelines should be followed. Whether fresh or thawed, the bird should not be ice cold before it goes into the oven. Leaving it out for about an hour should bring it to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Stuff the turkey, if desired, and put it in a rack on a roasting pan. Roast it for 30 minutes, basting once or twice with a little butter or oil. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees, and continue roasting until the thigh meat registers 170 degrees -- altogether about 18 minutes a pound. The United States Department of Agriculture recommends 20 to 25 minutes a pound and 180 degrees internal temperature for a stuffed turkey, but that excessive margin of safety results in dry turkey. Since salmonella is destroyed at 160 degrees, cooking the turkey to 170 degrees is more than adequate. The internal temperature of the stuffing should be 165 degrees.", "headline": {"main": "Food Notes"}, "_id": "4fd1ad688eb7c8105d6cdecf", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/24/garden/food-notes-125094.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": ""}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Della Femina and Friends    Just before summer's end, Jerry Della Femina managed to open his latest project in East Hampton, L.I.: Jerry & David's Red Horse Market.

This grand bazaar representing Spain, France, Italy, North Africa, Greece, Turkey and the Middle East offers a tempting array of glossy olives, fragrant spices, earthy grains, a hundred or so cheeses, oils, dried beans and assorted yogurts. Pandeli Andonopulo, the owner, also owns the Ninth Avenue Cheese Shop on 39th Street. He branched out because he needed more space for all the foods he wanted to sell. Beyond the Mediterranean, there are specialties from Russia, Poland, Mexico, Asia and even quite an assortment from Peru. This is a place to find fresh and dried chilies, Thai jasmine rice, strings of tiny Turkish dried okra to stew, dried mulberries, star anise and freshly quarried blocks of halvah studded with pistachios. In the back of the store is a well-tended produce market that carries everything from plain yellow onions to exotica like purple potatoes, mizuna (Japanese mustard) and frisee, a type of curly mustard. The bakery on the premises turns out delicious waffle-textured sesame-sprinkled Turkish pita, plus enough flaky syrup and honey-drenched pastries for 1,001 nights. The kitchen makes well-seasoned salads, dips, spreads and other dishes. A spicy Mediterranean goat-cheese spread is an eye-opening appetite whetter. The silken Ottoman-style artichoke hearts and vegetables in olive oil and lush elephant-bean salad are some other reasonably priced dishes at $3.95 or so a pound. And Mr. Andonopulo promises there will be more to come. Natura is open 10 A.M. to 8 P.M. Monday to Saturday and 11 A.M. to 6 P.M. on Sunday; (212) 397-4700. Fast French Fries Sam Balan knows his chips. This aerospace engineer, who was on the team that created the lunar module, has now come up with a computerized vending machine capable of turning out one four-ounce serving of french fries a minute. The manufacturer, Adelaide Manufacturing of Miami, also has a more powerful model that can do the job in half the time. Previous attempts at creating such a machine relied on frozen fries. This machine is far simpler and less bulky. It uses tiny barley-sized pellets of dehydrated potato that are reconstituted instantly by mixing them with a jet stream of water. They are then pushed through a mold shaped like a french fry, dropped into hot canola oil, ejected into a cup and sold for $1 -- probably more at the local 20-plex. The fries are crispy and tasty enough, their creamy mashed-potato centers never mealy, like some frozen fries. The machine, which uses standard 110-volt current, costs $15,000; the wholesale price for distributors will be $10,000. Net profit on each $1 order of fries is estimated at 35 cents. The first machines are expected to begin operating by the end of April. Breads and Pastries Cuisine de l'Art, 166 Main Street (near Franklin Street) in Nyack, N.Y., is a bakery and craft shop that opened in late December and offers an assortment of crusty sourdough breads and inviting pastries. Stevan Nikolic, the owner, previously worked with Eli Zabar at E.A.T. in Manhattan and was one of the founders of St. Famous Bread on Ninth Avenue, near 53d Street. For his new venture he has created a potato-dill sourdough bread ($2.50), another bread seamed with four cheeses ($4), a rich apple-cinnamon-raisin loaf ($3), apple and raspberry squares ($1.25) and savory spinach and cheese turnovers ($1.50). The focaccia d'Avignon ($2), with its herbaceous tomato topping, is excellent warm and cut in strips. Mesquite Jelly Grilling over mesquite seems to have been a flash in the pan. Chefs now pay more attention to the kind of oil drizzled on the plate than the fuel for the fire. If you miss mesquite, here's a new way to taste it. Texas Traditions, a fledgling company in the hill country near Austin, makes a golden jelly made from mesquite beans. It has a delicate lemon-honey flavor and is good as a spread or in glazes and sauces. The company also makes a rosy prickly-pear cactus jelly and some pepper jellies. The jellies are sold in shops in Texas and are also available by mail order from Texas Traditions, Route 1, Box 123B, Georgetown, Tex. 78626; telephone (512) 863-7291, or fax (512) 869-6212. The price is $5 for a 10-ounce jar, plus shipping. IT'S THE SEASON FOR SHAD SHAD have started moving up the Atlantic Coast and are starting to be sold at the Fulton Fish Market in Manhattan. The fish, many of which are caught off the Chesapeake Bay, are quite abundant even though it is still early in the season. Fish markets in the New York region are selling fresh shad fillets for $7 to $8 a pound. Shad -- moist, pinkish and fairly rich-tasting -- is usually sold filleted because this fish, a member of the herring family, has multiple rows of needle-thin bones that take experience to remove. Shad roe is $6 to $8 a pound in most markets that sell shad.", "headline": {"main": "Food Notes"}, "_id": "4fd1b2b18eb7c8105d6d60fa", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/19/garden/food-notes-030792.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}], "meta": {"hits": 58936, "time": 127, "offset": 1180}}, "status": "OK"}
