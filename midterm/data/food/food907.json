And instead of ball-park mustard and ketchup, salsas, cold sauces or compound butters are served on the side. The standard tools for the barbecue chef have also changed. In California it is now against the law to use lighter fluid as a fire starter because of its contribution to air pollution (not to mention the bad taste it can impart to food). Instead, people are using kindling. But a useful new product for lighting charcoal easily has just been produced by Griffo Grill. Called Cob Lites, it consists of corn cobs that have been dipped in food-grade paraffin. They produce an intense heat when burned, and they don't smell.

Nevertheless, seasonal cooking is greeted with a growing chorus of \"bah-hum-bug\" these days. After all, farmed salmon is available any time of the year; Chilean asparagus doesn't wait for a thaw; and soft-shell crab from the Gulf of Mexico have stretched the season to nearly eight months.
