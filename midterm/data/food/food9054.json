It is during the coldest months, for instance, that soft and fuzzy suddenly seem fair game. \"Deer\" becomes venison and then becomes dinner. Rabbit is served as \"lapin a la moutarde,\" or \"pappardelle et coniglio,\" or \"conejo en mole\" -- more elegant phrasing perhaps, but rabbit stew all the same. While the consumption of deer and other game was once limited by hunting season to winter, rabbits have been domesticated for centuries. And yet, in most cultures, rabbit remains a winter meat. This habit, like many of the ways rabbit is prepared, may be leftover from the days when rabbits and hares ran wild. Each has dark, gamy flesh that requires pungent marinades -- cinnamon and clove, garlic and mustard, heady red wines and dried fruits -- and long, slow cooking.

In this era of micro-moment cuisine, who can even bear to read through the recipe? But as bothersome as they may sound, as conducive as the thought of them may be to opening cans or buying takeout, beans are actually remarkably convenient, an attribute that has long been appreciated by those who do know beans. The soaking requires no attention. Then, rinsed and mixed with the right blend of ingredients and enough liquid in a heavy, tightly covered pot, any variety of dried bean -- baby limas, Great Northerns, kidney beans, chickpeas, black beans, pinto beans, to name a few -- can be left in a slow oven or crock pot to cook to rich, mellow succulence, untended.
