But certain guidelines should be followed. Whether fresh or thawed, the bird should not be ice cold before it goes into the oven. Leaving it out for about an hour should bring it to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Stuff the turkey, if desired, and put it in a rack on a roasting pan. Roast it for 30 minutes, basting once or twice with a little butter or oil. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees, and continue roasting until the thigh meat registers 170 degrees -- altogether about 18 minutes a pound. The United States Department of Agriculture recommends 20 to 25 minutes a pound and 180 degrees internal temperature for a stuffed turkey, but that excessive margin of safety results in dry turkey. Since salmonella is destroyed at 160 degrees, cooking the turkey to 170 degrees is more than adequate.
