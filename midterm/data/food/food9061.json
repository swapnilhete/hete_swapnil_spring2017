We arrived early, but the lawn was already crowded despite the threat of rain. We found an empty spot near the front and, feeling lucky, settled ourselves down and spread out our feast. It was not an elaborate picnic, but it drew stares from our immediate neighbors. Instead of the usual cold roast chicken, an Austrian friend, Ingeborg Hecht, made a dish I had not eaten in a long time: wiener schnitzel. She used pounded chicken breasts instead of veal (which can often be watery), and they were wonderfully juicy inside a crisp coating of bread crumbs. To go with the schnitzel we had salads of chopped tomatoes mixed with red onion and kernels of corn (easy to transport in a plastic container) and waxy Yukon gold potatoes tossed in a mustard vinaigrette with tarragon and hard-boiled eggs.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "A Feast of a Picnic With Chicken Wiener Schnitzel and Salads"}, "_id": "4fd1dff38eb7c8105d72600d", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/26/nyregion/food-a-feast-of-a-picnic-with-chicken-wiener-schnitzel-and-salads.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "WHEN apples replace peaches on the produce stand you know summer has segued into fall.

This, while my 5-year-old stepdaughter was obsessed with making life-size mermaids out of papier-mache (she did this at the kitchen table, every afternoon), and I was slogging through a midlife crisis. It was within this context that I turned to an odd medium for comfort. I never liked cold soup, but it was a comment on my mental state that I needed something completely out of character for solace. And it worked. The act of making and assembling it functioned as a kind of homeopathic psychogen. To the degree that cold soup is a mess, the endeavor mirrored my life.

This spice -- actually the dried stigma of a type of crocus, with orange and red threads that look like pipe tobacco -- is wonderful when used sparingly, adding a subtle dimension to a dish. But saffron has a penetrating aroma that can be overwhelming if too much is used, which is why some people do not take to it. But used in the right quantities, it brings out the flavor of seafood, which makes it a natural in paella and risotto (when you add it to rice, its hue begins to darken and develop like a print in a photographer's lab). It also marries well with the acid flavor of tomatoes, making it a good foil for a fatty fish like salmon. In Spain it is often combined with ground almonds, garlic and parsley and added to stews. It goes very well with the rather bland flavors of veal or chicken. Saffron is expensive -- around $5 for a small phial -- because it has to be harvested by hand. But only a few threads are needed in a dish. They should be stored away from the light or they will lose their pungency.
