This wasn't very practical, and since then I graduated to a proper charcoal grill, which I use in the country. Now, outdoor grills are getting more and more fancy. I had never even considered buying one that uses gas, however, until a secondhand model was offered to me at a very cheap price. Now, even my husband -- who was convinced that one would never get that great smoky flavor cooking with gas -- has become a convert. The great thing about it is that the cook is able to control the cooking temperatures. No longer do you worry about the fire going out before the food is cooked properly, nor do you run the risk of serving food that is charred outside and raw in the middle.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Successful Grilling, No Matter What the Grill"}, "_id": "4fd1f3218eb7c8105d74b12b", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/17/nyregion/food-successful-grilling-no-matter-what-the-grill.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BARBECUE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "ON a warm summer day, when you want to eat something light, a seafood salad is particularly refreshing.
