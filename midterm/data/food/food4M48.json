Making one, however, is a task: you have to cut the gauzy cheesecloth, then chase the peppercorns that slip out at the seam. Now Hiroko Shimbo, author of ''The Japanese Kitchen'' (Harvard Common, 2000), has made things easier. She has a line of thin pouches called Handy Disposable Bags that are large enough to accommodate a handful of aromatics, like bay leaves, thyme sprigs, dried orange peel, coriander seeds and peppercorns. The bags are made of a dense but permeable cloth with the texture of a fabric softener sheet. All you do is slip the herbs into the pouch and reverse the ''cuff'' on the top seam. The cuff wraps over the open seam and seals it well. Drop it into broths as you would a large teabag. The pouches are also handy for loose tea and for adding mint to iced tea. They are $5.95 (including shipping) for a box of 30 at www.hirokoskitchen.com, and $5.95 at A Cook's Companion, 152 Atlantic Avenue (Clinton Street), in Brooklyn; (718) 852-6901.
