This gentle ridge, called by geologists a terminal moraine, lifts Scuttlehole Road above the rich farmland that slopes southward to the sea. Part of a 100-mile spine marking the glacier's terminal extension, the ridge runs from Brooklyn to Amagansett at the far end of Long Island's South Fork and enters the sea where it may once have formed a third fork, long since eroded. This glacier, aided in its progress by the broad river valley that would later become Long Island Sound, shaped the hundred-mile sandbar known as Long Island. Gathering in its passage vast quantities of rock, soil and vegetation as it pushed southward, the glacier, like a retreating bulldozer, left in its wake quantities of debris that eventually formed the rich and spongy topsoil of eastern Long Island's south shore, called an outwash plain. Here and there, where the farm fields meet the beach, the eroding borders of topsoil reveal layers of fertile earth, like rich chocolate cake encased in an icing of white sand.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Lend Me an Ear"}, "_id": "4fd236308eb7c8105d7c8446", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/11/magazine/food-lend-me-an-ear.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "CORN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "About 18 years ago, I was pushing my year-old son, Eddie, in a stroller, with his 4-year-old brother, Frank, walking beside and tormenting Skeletor, his action-figure friend.

We were headed home up University from Washington Square Park on a broiling Sunday afternoon when a belligerent pitchman handed me a DoveBar together with a lot of malarkey. It was about a buck, and I was feeling thin and wiped out by the summer as I always do. The Dove was, of course, ice cream frozen around one of those underweight tongue depressors and appeared to be related to a Popsicle or Good Humor bar. But when I actually bit into it -- hard chocolate shell, contrasting soft vanilla ice cream inside -- it was clearly a Popsicle or Good Humor that had been to grad school. I lied to the boys, telling them it was a rubber toy for the dog, which they seemed to buy even though we didn't have a dog, and mimed throwing it away. Smitten, I searched out DoveBars for the next few months and devoured them wherever they stood. With all the competition in 2002, the Dove may not seem quite so revolutionary, but in '85 it was totemic. A few weeks later, in a local Italian restaurant, I ordered a ball of ice cream called tartuffo, only to discover that it, too, was a DoveBar, though not made by the same company, and instead of being a stodgy solid rectangle, it was shaped into a jolly sphere with not only vanilla and chocolate ice creams inside but also a cherry and a peppering of sliced almonds. Ever since, I have just about never failed to order tartuffo whenever it is on a menu.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Bombes Away"}, "_id": "4fd22f6d8eb7c8105d7bda84", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/magazine/food-bombes-away.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "The best roast goat I ever ate was served from a copper tray at a villa high in the mountains above Muscat, the capital of Oman, the reclusive sultanate that stretches some 2,000 miles along the Arabian Sea and whose opulent past enriches its mode...", "section_name": "Magazine", "print_page": "65", "abstract": "Jason Epstein article on proper way to cook lamb; recipes; photos (M)", "type_of_material": "News", "subsection_name": null, "pub_date": "2002-03-17T00:00:00Z", "word_count": 1758, "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "byline": {"person": [{"rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "Epstein", "organization": "", "firstname": "Jason"}], "original": "By Jason Epstein"}, "multimedia": [], "blog": [], "lead_paragraph": "The best roast goat I ever ate was served from a copper tray at a villa high in the mountains above Muscat, the capital of Oman, the reclusive sultanate that stretches some 2,000 miles along the Arabian Sea and whose opulent past enriches its modern culture with soft infusions of ancient colors, textures and tastes. Even today you can walk along the shore at Salala, the port that served the China trade, and find undisturbed shards of age-old porcelain strewn on the beach, or you can wait in the city's modern airport beside a young Bedouin woman in a silver, birdlike half-mask, the silken cuffs of her French blouse visible against hennaed wrists beneath her smart black caftan. I had eaten roast goat many times before in Hispanic restaurants in the United States and in Mexico, where the villagers still wrap the quartered animal in banana leaves (as our Omani chef did), tie it in a basket of palm fronds and bury it overnight in a smoldering fire pit so that on the following day the spiced meat falls away in caramelized shreds. This fire-pit cookery was probably brought to the New World by the conquistadors, whose ancestors had themselves been conquered some 700 years earlier by Muslim Arabs whose desert cuisine, along with their genes, had mingled for centuries with Spain's. And it is this cooking, introduced by the gold-crazed Spaniards as they stumbled toward what is now Kansas, that may have been the ancestor of today's slow-cooked barbecue -- the brash New World descendant of our Omani chef's fugue of melted dates, powdered cloves, cardamom, cumin, cinnamon and black pepper.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "The Science of the Lambs"}, "_id": "4fd22e9e8eb7c8105d7bc9d6", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/17/magazine/food-the-science-of-the-lambs.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "WINTER desserts have a heartier personality than the delicate peach tarts, berries-and-cream combinations or refreshing melon soups of summer.

The eggs were full of spinach with a flicker of nutmeg, and the bacon was roasted in the oven, just before the crisp went in. This was bacon from real pigs, old-fashioned pigs, and a pound gave off nearly a cup of grease, for which I said silent thanks. I poured it off into a dish, where it now sits in the refrigerator, white and waxy, until I call it up for corn bread. But I didn't wash the hotel pan I used because I thought it would come in handy for something. And it did when I found some glossy hake fillets for dinner. The oven went on low, the hotel pan went into the 325-degree heat just long enough to melt the bacon grease, the hake was swiped on each side in the slick of fat before going into the oven and 12 minutes later we were all eating bacon fish. The point here is not this nonrecipe, though I urge it on you as a cheap and easy knockoff of the halibut poached in goose fat that helped make Rocco DiSpirito's name many years ago. The point is that I made a dinner that my entire family ate. Pasta and pizza aside, that may be a first.
