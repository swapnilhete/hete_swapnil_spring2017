In a dessert, the interplay of sweet and savory delivers something a lot more satisfying than what mere sugar can provide. Savory sweets seem to occupy an ancient place in our collective memory. They taste of bloodier, grittier times. Maybe it's the bittersweet chocolate the Aztecs once sipped or the pounded fruit-and-nut cakes thatthe Romans brought along on long journeys that make the savory sweet so evocative. Or maybe their associative power is merely a physiological one. If, as Jews do on Rosh ha-Shanah, you dip a slice of apple in honey, the apple will taste tart. A slice of the same apple eaten with tart cheese, in the Yankee fashion, will taste sweet.
