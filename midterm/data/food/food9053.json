Perhaps that explains why so many people eat chocolate on Valentine's Day (conversely, those who fall out of love have lower levels of phenylethylamine, which may explain why they often go on a chocolate binge). In any event, there are few better ways to end a Valentine's Day dinner than with a dessert made from chocolate. I like chocolate desserts that are fairly straightforward, and not too sweet. A dark, moist chocolate cake, unadorned by creams or icings, is one of my favorites. I also love a hot chocolate souffle, something I like to order in French restaurants when they have it on the menu. Making a hot souffle at home, however, is not difficult if you have a reliable oven. It is important to use egg whites at room temperature, since they will expand more when they are beaten and help the souffle rise. They should be whisked until they form glossy peaks, not over-beaten or over-folded, or the souffle will be flat. Care should also be taken when melting chocolate. It turns into a solid lump if the heat is too high. Melt it in a slow oven or a double boiler.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Valentine's Splurge: Chocolate Desserts"}, "_id": "4fd1cb7f8eb7c8105d7010f5", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/nyregion/food-valentine-s-splurge-chocolate-desserts.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHOCOLATE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "THE most popular way to eat squid (or calamari, as it is frequently called) is deep-fried to a crisp golden turn with mayonnaise or tomato sauce for dipping.

Place the meat in a deep bowl, add the white wine and vinegar and allow to marinate six to eight hours. 2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 3. Remove the meat from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and pat the beef dry. Heat the oil in a heavy three-quart casserole. Add the beef and brown it on all sides. Remove the meat from the casserole and add the onions and carrots and cook over medium-low heat until tender and lightly browned. Stir in the garlic, then add the raisins, ginger, allspice and brown sugar. Add the stock, the reserved marinade and the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer, scraping the bottom of the pan. Stir in the bay leaves and salt and pepper to taste. Return meat to casserole. 4. Cover the casserole and place in the oven. Bake for about two hours, until the meat is tender. 5. To serve, remove the meat from the casserole and slice it. Arrange on a platter. Reheat the sauce and check seasoninings. Add some or all the lemon juice if the sauce does not seem tart enough. Spoon some of the hot sauce over the meat and pass the rest. 6. Alternatively, the meat can be refrigerated overnight in the cooking liquid and the next day the meat can be sliced and the sauce reheated before serving. This will improve the meat's flavor and texture and allow the layer of chilled fat on liquid's surface to be removed and discarded.
