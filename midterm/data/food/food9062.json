The French have always loved this green, leafy vegetable. But in the United States, until recently, it was almost impossible to find unless you grew it yourself. Like rhubarb (to which it is related), it has an acid taste, which does not appeal to everyone. I love sorrel -- and I also love the fact that once you have planted it in your garden, it grows in abundance and needs little care. Sorrel is best known for the famous chilled soup that appears in many different versions throughout Europe and Russia, usually made with a base of chicken stock and cream. When sorrel leaves are cooked, they make a puree, which is very good with fatty fish like mackerel or salmon or as a filling for an omelette or as a sauce for chicken, veal or lamb. I also like to mix sorrel with mashed potatoes and serve it with roast chicken, grilled meat or fish. Raw young leaves are also delicious mixed into a salad with other greens.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Sorrel, Associated With France, Finds a Place Here"}, "_id": "4fd1f6488eb7c8105d750c96", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/19/nyregion/food-sorrel-associated-with-france-finds-a-place-here.html", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "FRANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SORREL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "PASSOVER and Easter closely coincide this year, and asparagus, a perennial springtime treasure, suits both holidays.
