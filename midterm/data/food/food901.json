She's serving dinner. I understand Johanna and her need for ceremony, especially in the summer, when the living is supposed to be easy. This is exactly what propels her in the opposite direction. Summer, she feels, should have distinctive moments -- quiet, intimate interludes that stand in sharp relief to the season's jocular mood. Some people have suggested that this need is neurotic.
