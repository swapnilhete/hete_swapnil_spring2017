But it is often overlooked in favor of more glamorous out-of-season vegetables, which cost more than twice the price. It is a pity, because it can be one of the most delicious vegetables when imaginatively prepared (when it is not boiled into oblivion). The two most common kinds on the market (apart from Chinese cabbages) are the crinkly dark green savoy cabbage and the familiar pale, smooth green cabbages with tightly wrapped leaves, which become almost translucent when cooked. Savoy cabbage is particularly good with game like pheasant or squab, flavored with bacon, white wine and chicken stock. Cabbage also goes well with rich fish like salmon or tuna. The celebrated French chef Joel Robuchon cooks cabbage with butter and cream and serves it under fillets of salmon with a white wine and sherry vinegar sauce. On a humbler level, one of my favorite cabbage dishes is colcannon, which my Irish grandmother used to make when I was a child. It consists of leftover mashed potatoes and cabbage sauteed in butter like a pancake.

They are easy to add to a bowl of cereal or fold into pancake batter and, because they are delicious with maple syrup, they are excellent to warm with the syrup to top pancakes or waffles. And they are ideal for making quick muffins or scones, ready to come out of the oven and go to the table, still warm, for a festive weekend breakfast. Blueberry Bran Muffins Total time: 50 minutes 1/2 cup soft unsalted butter (1 stick), plus butter for pans if needed 3/4 cup 100 percent bran cereal (not flakes) 1 cup whole-wheat flour 3/4 cup all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 cup, packed, light brown sugar 2 eggs 2/3 cup plain yogurt 1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries. 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter 12 two-and-a-half-inch muffin cups or line them with fluted paper. 2. Combine the bran cereal, whole- wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder, baking soda and cinnamon in a bowl and stir to blend the ingredients. Set aside. 3. Beat the butter until it is creamy and beat in the brown sugar. Stir in the eggs one at a time, then add one-third of the flour mixture. Stir in half the yogurt, then repeat with another third of the flour mixture, the remaining yogurt and the remaining flour mixture. Fold in the blueberries. 4. Spoon the batter into the muffin cups. They should not be quite filled. 5. Bake until the tops are firm to the touch and lightly browned, about 35 minutes. Yield: 12 muffins. Blueberry Corn Muffins Total time: 45 minutes 2 to 3 tablespoons melted butter 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar 2/3 cup milk 1 egg, lightly beaten 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1/4 cups blueberries. 1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Use a tablespoon of the melted butter to grease 12 two-and-a-half-inch muffin tins, or fit them with fluted paper liners. 2. Mix the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, three-fourths teaspoon of the cinnamon, salt and half a cup of sugar together in a bowl. 3. Mix the milk, egg and vanilla together and stir into the dry ingredients just until the ingredients are moistened. Stir in the melted butter. Lightly mix in the blueberries. 4. Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin tins until the tins are nearly filled to the top. Combine the remaining sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle on the tops of the muffins. 5. Put in the oven and bake until the muffins have risen in peaks over the tops of the tins and are lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Cool briefly before serving. Yield: 12 muffins. Blueberry Scones Total time: 40 minutes 1 1/2 cups flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 4 tablespoons cold butter, in pieces 2 tablespoons light brown sugar 1 egg 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon milk 3/4 cup blueberries. 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. 2. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt and nutmeg in a bowl or in a food processor and mix or process briefly to blend the ingredients. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender or two knives or, by machine, by pulsing quickly, just until the mixture looks mealy. 3. Stir in the brown sugar. If you used a food processor, transfer the mixture to a bowl before adding the brown sugar by hand. Mix the egg with the half cup of milk and, with a fork, lightly mix the liquid into the dry ingredients to form a soft dough. 4. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured board, flatten it and top it with the blueberries. Gently knead the dough a few times to incorporate the blueberries, taking care not to squash the berries. Add a little more flour if necessary. 5. Once the berries have been incorporated, pat the dough into a circle about seven inches in diameter and nearly an inch thick. Cut into eight wedges and brush each with the remaining milk. 6. Put the wedges about an inch apart on an ungreased baking sheet, preferably one that is not dark metal. Bake 15 to 18 minutes, until the scones have risen and are lightly browned. Remove from the oven and cool about 10 minutes before serving. Yield: 8 scones.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Ways to Begin Breakfast With Blueberries"}, "_id": "4fd1e0158eb7c8105d726607", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1998/08/16/nyregion/food-ways-to-begin-breakfast-with-blueberries.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "A FEW years ago I bought a small pot of sorrel and planted it outdoors.

Instead, the young waiters and waitresses who are trendily dressed in black, draw a chair up to your table and reel off the dishes of the day.
