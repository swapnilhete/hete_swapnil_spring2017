In Catalina, Ariz., about 20 miles north of Tucson and the famed Canyon Ranch, this pretty retreat of man-made brooks and strategically placed flower beds is an oasis of green under a parched desert sun. Here, guests tend to be clear-eyed, relaxed and perpetually glowing, as they should be. The difference at Miraval is that there are no restrictions -- you eat what you want and how much you want, period. All the kitchen does is provide choices, lots and lots of choices. The breakfast and lunch buffets and the a la carte dinner are more suggestive of the offerings on a luxury cruise ship than at a monastic retreat.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Hit the Spa"}, "_id": "4fd20fd98eb7c8105d783223", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/20/magazine/hit-the-spa.html", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "NEFF, CARY"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "MIRAVAL LIFE IN BALANCE RESORT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "THE sandwich of the moment is the wrap.

Preheat a broiler or grill. Beat the mustard, mayonnaise, vinegar and three tablespoons of the olive oil together. Use two tablespoons of this mixture to brush the chicken breasts on both sides. 2. Broil or grill the chicken, turning it once, until lightly browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes on each side. Set aside. 3. Heat the remaining oil in a small skillet, add the bread crumbs and garlic and cook over medium heat until lightly browned. Remove from heat, cool briefly and mix with the cheese. 4. Toss the lettuce and remaining dressing together. Divide the lettuce among the four tortillas. Slice the chicken on the bias and arrange the slices over the salad. Sprinkle with the bread crumbs and cheese. Season with salt and pepper. 5. Fold about an inch on opposite sides of one tortilla over the filling. Then tightly roll up the tortilla from the unfolded side. Wrap in a piece of foil or waxed paper and repeat with the remaining tortillas. Yield: 4 servings.

Heat one tablespoon of the oil in a skillet, add the peppers and saute until they have softened. Remove from the heat and sprinkle with half the vinegar. 2. Divide the peppers among the four tortillas and scatter the goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes over them. 3. Toss the arugula with the remaining oil and vinegar and spread on top. 4. Fold about an inch on opposite sides of one tortilla over the filling. Then tightly roll up the tortilla from the unfolded side.
