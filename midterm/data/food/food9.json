The profits were immediate, substantial and certain to increase. I had precipitated what would thereafter be called ''the paperback revolution.'' This trip was one of the rewards. In those prejet days, when most trans-Atlantic travelers sailed to Europe, it was customary for publishers to go first class. Book publishing has never been lucrative, but for me (and probably for many others), the work we did in those years was itself payment enough.

In one of her dispatches, Elaine, who is from Georgia, reported that her grandmother had two biases about food: roast beef had to be cooked until it fell apart, and she couldn't abide collard greens. To her, Elaine wrote, ''collards were worse than useless, and any house where they had been cooked had to be burned to the ground. She was a turnip-greens woman.'' I didn't know it at the time, but my own mother, until recently, was one, too.

Alfred Leland Crabb writes, ''These two were used in fitting combination . . . by 1810, and the townspeople's appetite for them has not waned.'') I discovered her allegiance this year when I was appointed cook for Thanksgiving and called her from the produce aisle to ask how many people were coming so I'd be sure to get enough collards. ''Collards?'' she roared with such disgust I almost dropped my cellphone. ''They are tough and, well, just awful.'' I responded that I had recently eaten some of my friend Robert Carter's braised collards at the superlative Peninsula Grill in Charleston, S.C., and that they were some of the most delicious things I had ever tasted.

Cream gravy looks a little too much like cat throw-up to me, but the sausage was good and so were the biscuits, and I was impressed that Richey, who is also a talented producer and songwriter, was doing his own cooking.

Against all odds he returned with netfuls of sardines, fed the town with this pie and wound up with a dish and an extremely minor holiday named after him.

Cabbage smells up the kitchen, looks pathetic, kids don't like it and, in Grigson's words, it can ''ruin a meal with its wet flab.'' Unfortunately, her and David's solutions haven't been satisfactory either; rather than revealing its rich and subtle flavors, they tend to weigh it down with a mask of bacons, butters, cheeses and creams, chestnuts, sausages and, in the case of David's gros chou far\u00e7i \u00e0 la Proven\u00e7ale, a sheep's brain.
