The most common way of cooking them is to dust them with flour and fry them. They are also very good grilled. I like to saute them a la meuniere and sprinkle them with a little hazelnut oil, chopped chives and lemon. They are also good grilled -- cutting down on fat -- and served with sauces made with tomato, lime and basil, or a puree of red peppers with tarragon. Soft-shell crabs are not, as many people think, a particular species. They are, in fact, blue crabs, caught when they have molted their hard shells and before they have had time to grow new ones. The back seam of their shell breaks open, and they step out of it as though taking off an overcoat. The crabs are collected before their carapaces have time to harden and are shipped to market in boxes lined with seaweed, which allows them to breathe. Most soft-shell crabs come either from Georgia or, as the weather gets warmer, from Chesapeake Bay. When buying soft-shell crabs, make sure they are alive, for they spoil very quickly. The seller will usually kill them and clean them for you. Look for those with translucent, pearl-gray skin, white underbellies and pink claw tips. They should be plump and springy to the touch, with no trace of hard shell.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Soft-Shell Crabs Herald Warmer Days"}, "_id": "4fd1fe558eb7c8105d75f19d", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/18/nyregion/soft-shell-crabs-herald-warmer-days.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "HOW long a recipe takes to prepare must be separated from how much attention it requires.
