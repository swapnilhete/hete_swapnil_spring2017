On Improving School Food The Center for Science in the Public Interest has published a booklet, \"Organizing for Better School Food,\" for parents and others who want to improve the menu in public and private schools. The booklet tells how to evaluate a school's food, how to organize a campaign to reduce the amount of fat and sugar in cafeteria food and how to improve the quality of food sold in vending machines. It also explains the national school lunch program so that parents can learn how to work within the system. And it describes how committees of parents helped improve the food in some school districts around the country. The book is $7 including postage from the center, 1875 Connecticut Avenue NW, Suite 300, Washington, D.C. 20009.

The American Spice Trade Association reports that in 1990 consumption of seasonings set another record, almost 795.5 million pounds. This is an increase of about 50 million pounds over 1989. Along with a general interest in spicier foods, especially Mexican and Cajun prepared and fast foods, the association attributes the increase to the use of seasonings to compensate for a decrease in salt use and to the plethora of spicy products in supermarkets. The largest increase, 22 million pounds, was in dehydrated onion and garlic, reflecting their use in prepared foods, snack foods and fast foods. Further evidence of the emphasis on prepared foods is the shift in spicy foods from retail to wholesale. In 1975, 60 percent of spice sales were at the retail level, and now it's only 40 percent. The pepper category showed the second-largest increase, gaining 17.3 million pounds. Of this, 14 million pounds was for hot red pepper, the rest for black and white.", "headline": {"main": "Food Notes"}, "_id": "4fd1a5e68eb7c8105d6bf626", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/11/style/food-notes-701091.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Help With the Bake-Off...", "section_name": "Home and Garden", "print_page": "4", "abstract": null, "type_of_material": "News", "subsection_name": null, "pub_date": "1991-07-31T00:00:00Z", "word_count": 825, "news_desk": "Living Desk", "byline": {"person": [{"rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "Fabricant", "organization": "", "firstname": "Florence"}], "original": "By Florence Fabricant"}, "multimedia": [], "blog": [], "lead_paragraph": "Help With the Bake-Off", "headline": {"main": "Foodnotes"}, "_id": "4fd1ab208eb7c8105d6c9239", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/31/garden/foodnotes.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Clothes for Cheeses    Bloomingdale's closed its fresh-food department over the weekend.
