It was 10 years ago this coming December, almost Christmas, and I was cold and jet-lagged and completely unable to imagine that anything would ever cheer me up again. Somehow I mustered the will to call my dear friend the columnist Alexander Chancellor, who ordered me straight onto a train to London -- and to the River Cafe, where I was to meet him for lunch. The taxi from the station got lost, and the restaurant, when we finally found it, was in a converted warehouse on a bleak stretch of the Thames. But inside it was warm and somehow sunny. A wood-burning stove had just been installed in the open kitchen; a low-key but extraordinarily intuitive waiter brought me a restorative Campari and soda and guided me through a menu he guaranteed would cure the hangover he could see I had (grilled squid with red chilies for some clean protein; pasta, but nothing too heavy, for some much-needed carbs).

I went, ostensibly, to learn Spanish -- my Presbyterian upbringing wouldn't allow me to classify such an extended trip as pure escape, so I came up with an actual reason to go. Also, since two-thirds of the Western Hemisphere speaks the language, I figured it wouldn't be a bad thing to do. (In school, I'd chosen sophistication over practicality and studied the French I barely remember.) So I found an apartment off the Plaza Mayor in Madrid and paid a big pile of euros to a language school run, improbably, by an Irish vegetarian named Declan. He was appalled at my love of bullfights and the huge Spanish rib steaks (chuletones) sprinkled with coarse salt from Alkalde (not to mention the strip steaks brought sizzling to the table at Casa Paco or the very happening Lucio, around the corner). Declan tried hard, but I never learned proper Spanish. I was too busy eating and drinking and making dozens of trips to the Prado and going to the bullfights every night during the feria. I learned to distinguish gambas from cigalas from carabineros (three of the heavenly sea creatures available a la plancha, simply cooked on a griddle, at the glorious La Trainera); I communed, a lot, with \u00c1ngel, the aptly named ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel at El Land\u00f3, my favorite restaurant in all of Madrid.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Lady in Spain"}, "_id": "4fd2772a8eb7c8105d838840", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/magazine/food-lady-in-spain.html", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "SPAIN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "My friend George Peterkin Jr. is fig obsessed.
