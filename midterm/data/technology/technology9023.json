The space agency has paid for a study on sonic booms that uses the same speakers that the pop singer used on his last tour. The study, being conducted by the Georgia Institute of Technology, is designed to measure the impact of sonic booms on people and buildings. The research is a small piece of the space agency's program to develop a supersonic commercial airplane larger and faster than the Concorde. The shape of a plane has an impact on the loudness of sonic booms, explosive noises that are an unwelcome byproduct of traveling faster than the speed of sound. By studying the sonic booms, and their effect on domestic bliss, Georgia Tech hopes to help designers determine the ideal shape for an airplane that would produce the least offensive booms.
