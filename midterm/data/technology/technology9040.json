Now aluminum companies, helped by innovations just coming into wide use, are taking on the market for cans containing noncarbonated beverages and foods. Aluminum accounts for nearly 97 percent of the cans with carbonated beverages. But the metal was considered not sturdy enough to hold foods like juice, vegetables or tomato sauce. Ninety percent of canned food is packaged in steel. Aluminum beverage cans get their stability from the pressure exerted by the gas in their carbonated contents. To duplicate this effect with noncarbonated foods, the Reynolds Metals Company injects a drop of liquid nitrogen into aluminum cans before sealing to provide the pressure to keep them from being easily dented on supermarket shelves. Glenn M. Jost, director of quality assurance of the can division at Reynolds Metals, said cans with nitrogen now account for about 10 percent of the company's annual output of 10 billion cans. Reynolds developed the liquid-nitrogen technology about nine years ago. But Mr. Jost said production had intensified in the last two years as aluminum-can producers turned more attention to packaging noncarbonated drinks and foods. The Aluminum Company of America is developing aluminum food cans with ridges to provide the stability of steel cans. These cans are not yet available commercially, said John McMann, an Alcoa spokesman. \"We are still in the development stage with them,\" he said, \"but we hope they will move us into the food-can area.\"", "headline": {"kicker": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY", "main": "Giving Aluminum Cans More Muscle"}, "_id": "4fd199168eb7c8105d6a8f00", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/21/business/business-technology-giving-aluminum-cans-more-muscle.html", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "REYNOLDS METALS CO"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ALUMINUM CO OF AMERICA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CONTAINERS AND PACKAGING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ALUMINUM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NEW MODELS, DESIGN AND PRODUCTS"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "LEAD: In 1983, the International Business Machines Corporation dropped an ambitious project to develop blazingly fast computers using superconducting circuits, concluding that such machines would never be economically feasible.
