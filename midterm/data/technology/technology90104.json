But electric blankets may be dangerous. And cyclamates, banned from diet soda 21 years ago as a cancer risk, may be coming back because more recent research casts doubt on the original suspicions. In nearly every aspect of modern life, in food, fuel, even building materials, there are ingredients suspected of causing cancer or organ damage, and the list is growing. New threats, like catching AIDS from a doctor, arouse public concern, often far out of line with their statistical probability. And the commonly used method to determine whether something is dangerous over long periods and in low doses is little trusted even by those who use it.", "headline": {"main": "As Science Gauges Life's Perils, More Can Be Less"}, "_id": "4fd1ab258eb7c8105d6c967a", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/19/us/as-science-gauges-life-s-perils-more-can-be-less.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Ozone, Good and Bad   Q.
