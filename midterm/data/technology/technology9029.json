NASA, whose checkbook for more than three decades has kept many American space contractors in business, has not been invited. Motorola conceives Iridium as a network of 66 low-orbit satellites that by the end of the decade is to provide wireless telephone service anywhere on earth. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is not participating because the project is being financed by private industry -- a fact that many experts see as a fundamental shift in the country's approach to space. Long the nation's biggest public works project, the space program is rapidly becoming a commerical affair. Where the Profits Are Some space businesses, like building and operating the commercial communications satellites used for telephone calls and television programs, have been making money for more than a decade. A newer business, the private launching of satellites and space-based geographic sensing systems, may soon become modestly profitable for companies like McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics.", "headline": {"kicker": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY", "main": "A New Crowd in NASA's Space"}, "_id": "4fd1bd468eb7c8105d6ea147", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/15/business/business-technology-a-new-crowd-in-nasa-s-space.html", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY PAGE (NYT)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SPACE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "EARTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CORPORATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEPHONES AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "In theory, the recently announced Time Warner-U S West deal is the perfect marriage.

But the race among the world's giant tire producers recently grew more intense when both the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and the Bridgestone Corporation of Japan announced the separate development of what they call run-flat tires. Bridgestone's tires, which require special wheels, are currently available on some customized Chevrolet Corvette models. Goodyear, which apparently hurried to make its announcement after Bridgestone introduced its run-flat tire, says its version will work with regular rims. But Goodyear is not expected to have its tires on the market until late next year. An Earlier Version The notion of such a product -- a tire that will carry a passenger car 50 to 200 miles or so after being deflated -- is not new. Continental A.G., the German tire company, tested one eight years ago on certain Mercedes-Benz models. But that product would also have required the auto makers to build a special wheel, a prospect the car companies dismissed as too costly.", "headline": {"kicker": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY", "main": "No Pressure?
