Affectionately named Godzilla or just Zilla, the program permits users to break up the thorniest scientific and other computing problems into small parts and then runs them in parallel on unoccupied machines. Godzilla will take up residence on any computer in a network of Next work stations whose owner gives permission. It waits until the computer is not being used and then runs part of the problem. If the user returns and taps his or her keyboard, Godzilla has the manners to stop what it's doing and wait for the computer to be free again. Godzilla has already been used for a variety of mathematical explorations, like factoring very large numbers. Richard E. Crandall, a physicist who directs Next's scientific computation group, said many other uses were possible. Projects as diverse as quantum theory calculations, designing new medicines or creating high-resolution computer animations are possible. Taken by itself, each Next computer has the power of a scientific work station. Yet when harnessed together by Zilla, a group of Nexts can match the speed of a supercomputer on some problems. To define the scale of Godzilla, the Next researchers like to speak of one Zilla unit, or a Z.U., which is equivalent to the power of 100 Next work stations. The performance of one Z.U. is roughly equal to the speed of a Cray Y/MP computer, one of the world's fastest. Zilla is not confined to Next computers. A network of Nexts running Zilla can be connected with a genuine supercomputer, creating a very fast computer.", "headline": {"kicker": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY", "main": "Creating Computer Godzillas"}, "_id": "4fd1a75b8eb7c8105d6c23cc", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/30/business/business-technology-creating-computer-godzillas.html", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY PAGE (NYT)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "FEDER, BARNABY J"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEPHONES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ELECTRONICS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DATA PROCESSING (COMPUTERS)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REPAIR SERVICES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "LEAD: Scientists have been continually improving photovoltaic cells by raising the amount of electricity they produce from a given amount of sunlight.
