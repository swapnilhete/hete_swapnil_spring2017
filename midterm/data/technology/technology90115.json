How can it be raining cats and dogs on one side of the street and be dry, even sunny, on the other? A. The phenomenon is most likely to occur in northern latitudes in a pattern of summery weather, said Fred Gadomsky, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, Pa. It can result from what meteorologists call \"local forcing,\" where very small local weather patterns prevail over broader weather conditions, he said. In wintertime, Mr. Gadomsky explained, broad sweeps of warm air rise up over cold air, and the lifting mechanism creates clouds that rise until they are cool enough to precipitate the water vapor they are saturated with. In summer, however, warm humid air masses can create such clouds on a very local basis, Mr. Gadomsky said. \"The uneven heating between a blacktop parking lot and a nearby field can be enough to start air going up over the more strongly heated part of the landscape,\" he said, and the small area of upward-moving air is enough to lead to clouds and precipitation. Hay Fever Q. Do you actually run a fever with hay fever? A. In general, no, said Dr. Amy Lichtenfeld, a New York allergist. When a person encounters a substance that he or she is allergic to, mast cells release a substance called histamine, she said, and pure histamine won't cause fever. Some people with allergies might develop obstruction of sinus passages and a subsequent sinus infection with fever. Some people may also mistake a rhinovirus infection, a common viral cause of the common cold, for hay fever. In general, doctors are able to distinguish between sinus infections, viral rhinitis and hay fever, Dr. Lichtenfeld said. Dr. Michael Kaliner, who is head of allergic diseases at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Md., said that historically hay fever has never been associated with fever, only with hay. It was first described in 1872 as \"autumnal catarrh,\" the nasal symptoms believed to be associated with the hay harvest, he said. Its connection with pollen counts of various kinds was discovered just a year later, he said.", "headline": {"main": "Q&A"}, "_id": "4fd1970f8eb7c8105d6a4e4d", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/06/science/q-a-581290.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "LEAD: To junior high school students here, classroom visitors can be as much a novelty as the knowledge they bring.
