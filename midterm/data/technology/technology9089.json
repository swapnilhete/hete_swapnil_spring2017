Realizing the futility of car alarms that are often ignored, the companies are installing devices that immobilize the car unless the correct key is used. These devices give owners special keys with tiny transmitters that send a numerical code that constantly changes. Once the key is inserted into the ignition, a sensor determines whether the code matches one of the billions stored in the car's memory. If the code is not recognized, the car will not start.
