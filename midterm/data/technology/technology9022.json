While some substances, like caffeine and alcohol, easily cross the barrier, many therapeutic drugs do not. Last week, Alkermes Inc., a neuro-pharmaceuticals company based in Cambridge, Mass., filed an application with the Food and Drug Administration to begin human clinical trials of RMP-7, a compound that enables many drugs to cross the barrier. The company hopes to begin safety studies of RMP-7 later this year, and soon after that to begin testing the compound's effectiveness in delivering various drugs. An Unusual Approach Many companies have attacked the blood-brain barrier problem in the course of their research on drugs to treat brain diseases, but Alkermes is unusual in that it is working only on delivery mechanisms for crossing the barrier, not therapeutic compounds. Alkermes's management believes that many existing drugs, like antibiotics and chemotherapy compounds, could be more effective if they could enter the brain in significant quantities.", "headline": {"kicker": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY", "main": "Breaching the Brain's Wall to Deliver Drugs"}, "_id": "4fd19bf88eb7c8105d6acd01", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/04/business/business-technology-breaching-the-brain-s-wall-to-deliver-drugs.html", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY PAGE (NYT)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "ALKERMES INC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BRAIN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DRUGS (PHARMACEUTICALS)"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "As complex plastics increasingly replace metals in cars and appliances, recycling these products becomes a larger problem.
