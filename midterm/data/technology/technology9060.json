Now, one modest business and one potentially big one may be emerging from the work of Pamela Weathers, a biotechnology professor at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and Kenneth Giles, the former head of her department. Through the Manostat Corporation of New York, the scientists are marketing a small device that they say can markedly improve the productivity of plants grown by researchers from small clumps of cells called tissue cultures. The Mistifier uses an ultrasonic transducer, similar to the device that creates mist in many home humidifiers, to turn a small, computer-controlled reservoir of plant nutrients into a mist. The mist is forced down a silicon tube network, carried by gas pumped by a standard aquarium aerator, onto the tissue cultures. In trials, the Mistifier tripled the number of shoots produced by banana cell cultures, and cultures from one ornamental plant produced 20 times more shoots. The length of the shoots in various plants was four to six times greater, and the contamination rate was also sharply lower. The Mistifier's commercial potential will be enhanced if Bio Rational Technology, the company founded by the professors, finds a way to increase the machine's capacity. Timber companies and commercial plant growers would want to produce thousands, or tens of thousands, of cultures at once. The technology's greatest promise may be as a means of extracting chemicals that can now be retrieved only by harvesting the plant. Professor Weathers said research suggested that the Mistifier's capacity to alter temperatures, nutrients and atmosphere might change that. The goal is to stimulate the growth of cell-culture root systems that produce the chemicals, change conditions to trick the roots into secreting the chemicals, and then return to the baseline growing conditions, encouraging the plant to restore its normal balance by producing more of the substances it released. \"Our goal is to turn plants into continuous producers,\" Professor Weathers said, comparing the current approach to killing a sheep each time one wants to obtain wool.", "headline": {"kicker": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY", "main": "Using Mist to Induce Plants to Produce"}, "_id": "4fd1c3d18eb7c8105d6f313c", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/28/business/business-technology-using-mist-to-induce-plants-to-produce.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "FLOWERS AND PLANTS"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "LEAD: Robots have cleaned up nuclear power plants, assembled electronic devices and painted cars, but are they ready for one of mankind's oldest jobs - milking cows?...", "section_name": "Business", "print_page": "6", "abstract": null, "type_of_material": "News", "subsection_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-07-25T00:00:00Z", "word_count": 270, "news_desk": "Financial Desk", "byline": null, "multimedia": [], "blog": [], "lead_paragraph": "LEAD: Robots have cleaned up nuclear power plants, assembled electronic devices and painted cars, but are they ready for one of mankind's oldest jobs - milking cows?", "headline": {"kicker": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY", "main": "A Mechanical Milkmaid: Will Cows Be Content?"}, "_id": "4fd198128eb7c8105d6a6eb9", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/25/business/business-technology-a-mechanical-milkmaid-will-cows-be-content.html", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "NETHERLANDS"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "GASCOIGNE-MELOTTE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RESEARCH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TESTS AND TESTING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ROBOTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MILK"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "LEAD: rrFor people who dream of boxing but don't fancy bloody noses, black eyes and chipped teeth, a new computerized shadow boxing system allows two people to square off without hurting each other....", "section_name": "Technology; Business", "print_page": "7", "abstract": null, "type_of_material": "News", "subsection_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-02-14T00:00:00Z", "word_count": 301, "news_desk": "Financial Desk", "byline": null, "multimedia": [], "blog": [], "lead_paragraph": "LEAD: rrFor people who dream of boxing but don't fancy bloody noses, black eyes and chipped teeth, a new computerized shadow boxing system allows two people to square off without hurting each other.", "headline": {"kicker": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY", "main": "Now, a Boxing Match Without the Pain"}, "_id": "4fd1aa828eb7c8105d6c8112", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/14/business/business-technology-now-a-boxing-match-without-the-pain.html", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "MOTIONTRONICS FOR SCIENCE INC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOXING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NEW MODELS, DESIGN AND PRODUCTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "DATA PROCESSING (COMPUTERS)"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}], "meta": {"hits": 41715, "time": 47, "offset": 600}}, "status": "OK"}
