Not only do birds migrate over Manhattan, they make Central Park a stopover on some of the most heavily traveled north-south migration routes, said Joseph Di Costanzo, an ornithologist and assistant on the Great Gull Island Project of the American Museum of Natural History, a museum field station at the mouth of Long Island Sound that studies common terns. \"Central Park is an oasis of green among all those big buildings,\" Mr. Di Costanzo said. \"As many as a hundred species in a day may be sighted during spring migration.\" That migration is already beginning, Mr. Di Costanzo said. He said he had seen a flock of grackles, generally among the first returning migrants to appear in the city, as they flew into Central Park last week. The peak of the migration is in May. While flocks may head for the park, individual birds also stop in Manhattan backyards, Mr. Di Costanzo said. One longtime resident of East 51st Street has a backyard list of well over 150 species, he said. Obsidian Q. Is obsidian considered a rock or a mineral? A. Obsidian, a naturally occurring glass, is an igneous rock, said Dr. Ralph Moberly, a geologist in the department of geology and geophysics at the University of Hawaii, Honolulu. \"It is lava that chilled so fast that minerals didn't have time to crystallize,\" he said. Obsidian is found around extinct volcanos in many parts of the world, Dr. Moberly said. It contains minerals like quartz and feldspar that could form crystals if left to themselves to cool slowly, but because it emerged and cooled so quickly, he said, \"there are few if any crystals in the substance.\" As a matter of formal definition, rocks are any mineral matter making up the earth, including materials like sand, mud and clay, as well as the harder materials described as rock in everyday language. Nearly all rocks are made of minerals, sometimes several. Minerals are defined as solid substances made up of atoms with an orderly and regular arrangement. This orderly arrangement means that minerals can form crystals if left to pack and arrange themselves. It also means that it is possible to express the composition of a mineral as a chemical formula.

Unfortunately, the predictions are almost always wrong.
