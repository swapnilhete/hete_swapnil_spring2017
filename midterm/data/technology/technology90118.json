The common aquarium goldfish, Crassius auratus, can live 30 years or more under ideal conditions, said Paul L. Sieswerda, curator of fishes and mammals at the New York Aquarium in Brooklyn. An aquarium limits their size, he said, but a pond lets them achieve their maximum growth. Some reach up to two feet in length. Goldfish often change color as they age and develop their full color patterns, Mr. Sieswerda said. In fact, one of the skills of goldfish breeders is to predict which fish are going to develop the best colors. Goldfish are closely related to the carp family and are quite hardy, he said. As long as the pond does not freeze over completely they can withstand very cold temperatures. Another pond fish, the koi, is even larger and more elaborate, Mr. Sieswerda said. It is very closely related to the wild carp, Cyprinus carpio, but has long been bred to achieve fantastic colors and shapes by fanciers in Japan, where prize fish are auctioned for large amounts of money. The koi is long-lived but not as hardy as the common goldfish.", "headline": {"main": "Q&A Goldfish"}, "_id": "4fd1a71c8eb7c8105d6c1be0", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/11/science/q-a-goldfish.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Fly on the Wall  Q.

A. \"Looking at flies in terms of weight to volume, they don't weigh much, so very little force is required to keep a fly from falling,\" said Dr. Alex Mintzer, an entomologist with the Entomological Society of America in Lanham, Md. That force is exerted by structures on the tarsi, the tips of the fly's legs, he said. First, there is a set of claws, which can be seen with a very good hand magnifier. There are also spongy pads that have ridges like a ruffled potato chip, providing for greater contact or adhesion, he said. They are cushions, not suction cups. These body parts allow the fly to stay in place and move with confidence, Dr. Mintzer said. When the fly moves, two of its six legs can be out of contact with the surface at any time. Ants tend to rely more heavily on their claws, which are relatively larger than those of flies, than their pads, which are relatively smaller. \"Some are not as good at climbing as you might think,\" Dr. Mintzer said. \"Ants that live on the ground where the soil is rough might not be able to climb well on smooth surfaces or upside down,\" the way tree-dwelling ants do, he explained. \"The ones that get into houses, of course, usually have that ability,\" Dr. MIntzer said. \"They are very small, so they have even less of a weight problem than flies.\"", "headline": {"main": "Q&A"}, "_id": "4fd19ea08eb7c8105d6b1ba2", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/04/science/q-a-496390.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "THE notebook computer category dominated the Comdex fall computer exposition last week in Las Vegas, Nev., but it was difficult to find many significant variations among the dozens of slim, portable models that were shown.
