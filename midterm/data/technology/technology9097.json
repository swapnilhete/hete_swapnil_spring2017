Far from it. This argument, known in the jargon of philosophy of science as ''naive methodological falsificationism,'' is indefensible. Social scientists are familiar with debates that ensue when a theory fails to predict accurately. Do we junk the theory after a single prediction failure? Of course not. The theory may indeed be wrong. But it may also be that we did not derive the predictions accurately from the theory. Or we made mistakes in measuring the data. Or the experiment was poorly constructed, so that it was not a definitive test. Or perhaps we have run into unexplained variance, since no theory explains everything all the time.", "headline": {"kicker": "Don't Throw Crackpottery at Haunted Houses", "main": "When Theory Fails"}, "_id": "4fd1c85a8eb7c8105d6faf85", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/01/opinion/l-when-theory-fails-626775.html", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "WEBER, STEVEN"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KRAUSS, LAWRENCE M"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Last month, at a conference in Buffalo called \"Science in the Age of (Mis)information,\" scores of scientists railed against \"anti science,\" including the vile trend known as postmodernism.
