A $1-per-head fee on all visitors has been in place for about two years, but the system relied on hikers stopping at a kiosk to pay before they ambled up the crater. The new system will collect fees from people coming by car, bus or on foot at a single tollbooth as they enter the park, said Daniel Quinn, state parks administrator. The fees will help pay for maintenance and interpretive services at more than 50 parks and monuments around the state, Mr. Quinn said.
