Judging from the voluminous public record, Mr. Ray's decision to drop the case is legally sound. Judging from the same record, his characterization of Mrs. Clinton's account of her role in the matter also seems on the mark. Except for new detail, the report adds little of substance to the preliminary findings Mr. Ray released in June. Our main quarrel with Mr. Ray involves timing -- that is, the decision to release the report only three weeks before voters go to the polls to choose between Mrs. Clinton and Rick Lazio in a closely contested Senate race. Mr. Ray and his staff argue that three weeks is enough time for the public to digest and debate the report and that delivering it earlier would have been procedurally difficult. But as the decision not to prosecute was made months ago, they could and should have avoided dropping reports during the September-October campaign season.
