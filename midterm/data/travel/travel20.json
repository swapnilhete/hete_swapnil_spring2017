All the senses are appealed to, and inconvenience and discomfort are purely vicarious. But in today's international climate, the tried-and-true staples of travel literature -- Proven\u00e7al cuisine, Americans in Paris, the hill towns of Tuscany -- have come to seem not just irrelevant but boring. Tame. A handful of recent travel books, featuring subjects that range from the only slightly offbeat (revisionist looks at Germany and modern Greece) to the truly mind-stretching (Kyrgyzstan, the Gobi Desert, wartime Afghanistan, peacetime Iraq), have thoroughly trumped the standard travel literature this summer. In THE BELLS IN THEIR SILENCE: Travels Through Germany (Princeton University, $24.95), Michael Gorra wonders why no one in the Anglo-American world writes travel books (as opposed to journalism or reportage) about contemporary Germany. Clearly because the subject is too loaded with dark associations: one is always brought up against the Nazi era, ''that neutron star into whose bitter gravity all German history seems to fall.'' Not that Gorra can avoid the subject either. In fact, he is no more able than the hotelier Basil Fawlty, in the classic ''Fawlty Towers'' episode, to suppress Nazi stereotypes when dealing with ordinary Germans, even though most of the people he meets are too young to have had anything to do with the atrocities of the past. Despite this, Gorra has made a noble effort to write a truthful book that, while colorful and impressionistic, also draws thoughtful conclusions about what he encounters.", "keywords": [{"value": "REVIEWS", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "TRAVEL AND VACATIONS", "name": "subject"}], "headline": {"main": "Travel"}}, {"slideshow_credits": null, "document_type": "article", "_id": "4fd2676a8eb7c8105d81d044", "section_name": "Travel; Arts; Books", "news_desk": "Book Review Desk", "print_page": "28", "multimedia": [], "subsection_name": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/02/books/travel.html", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "Karen Karbo reviews outstanding travel books of 2001; drawings (L)", "snippet": "YOUNG women are particularly avid travelers.

One can hazard a few guesses why this might be so: traveling is a subspecies of self-improvement, and a voyage out is not infrequently also a voyage of self-discovery, one that requires a lot of navel-gazing and journal-writing, activities that most young men, unless they're aspiring rock stars, are disinclined to pursue. Of course, older women also hit the road, and at any age women experience the adventure of foreign places differently from men.

Afterward, every destination acquired a sudden glow of hellfire, every trip an element of thoroughly unwanted suspense. Escape has become a problem in itself. A travel book without danger -- to the body, the soul or the future -- is entirely out of time. Such books, I can report, are still appearing. There are droll encounters with simple, cunning nut-brown persons, continent by continent, books where you can hear the jokes being harvested, cut and squeezed like dry lemons. Gentle novelists still jet to tourist spots, hoping a metaphor and a bit of reflection will make up for not quite seeing or understanding anything. Writers in their 20's try to get away with lyrical books about places they seem to think their parents never reached. No known force can stop the British freelancer from going abroad to live and assuming that it matters. American academics go abroad, it seems, mostly to buy chintz or terra cotta, but their books are just as long.

As Martin puts it, ''Renting -- not necessarily a palace, but no vulgar hotel -- is also a requirement for savoring the living Venice'' and truly understanding the city.
