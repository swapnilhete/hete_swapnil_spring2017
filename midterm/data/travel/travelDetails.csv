The Modern's ''Mies in Berlin,'' which runs until Sept. 11, examines the architect's career until 1938, when as the last director of the Bauhaus, he left Germany. The exhibition features about 285 of the architect's original drawings, including a rarely seen full-color, 40-square-foot proposal for a 1910 competition, a gouache on linen for a monument to Otto von Bismarck.

4fd2a56d8eb7c8105d88d1bb,"SECURITY POLICY MODIFIED -- Reacting to complaints from women who said they had been groped by airport screeners under a new policy to search for nonmetallic explosives, the Transportation Security Administration last week modified the procedures for pat-down security searches. But a lawyer representing some women seeking legal redress for what they claim were unnecessarily invasive pat-down searches that in some cases constituted ''groping or fondling,'' said yesterday that the modifications, though they ''slightly minimize the randomness of the selection'' of whom to search, were inadequate. The modified policy now states: ''Patting down the chest area will now only be conducted if it alarms a hand-held metal detector or if there is an irregularity or anomaly in the person's clothing outline. Unless these criteria are met, screeners will only pat down a line below the chest area to the waist, followed by a pat-down of the individual's entire back.'' But Norman Siegel, the civil rights lawyer representing the women, said, ''I do not believe the announced changes address the heart of the issue.'' He and some of his clients have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow with the agency in Washington. One concern, he said, is that ''since many women wear underwire bras, the wand is going to go off,'' subjecting that woman to a ''degrading'' pat-down search. The agency has said that screeners ''are trained to conduct the inspections in a professional, respectful manner, while maintaining our high level of security.'' TRAVEL MESS -- The problems with airline travel will not be over on New Year's Day. As anyone who flew last weekend can attest, with airports jammed, flights delayed and bags gone astray, the travel crush this holiday is more intense than it was during Thanksgiving, when domestic travel set a record. But the end of the holidays will not be the end of the crush, as Americans in record numbers are planning winter travel, according to the Travel Industry Association of America. The travel trade group's winter travel forecast predicts that Americans will take 243 million individual trips this month through next February, an increase of 2.6 percent over that period last winter. PICKUP AT LAX -- Picking up somebody by car at Los Angeles International Airport is a little easier for some this holiday season. The airport, which forecasts that it will handle about 2.8 million passengers during the period that started last Friday and continues through Sunday, has set aside a ''cellphone waiting lot,'' where motorists can park free till they get a call to pick up an arriving passenger at curbside. The 79-space lot is at 9011 Airport Boulevard, five minutes from the central terminal area. JOE SHARKEY",Technology; Business,445,2004/12/28

4fd259fb8eb7c8105d8066d9,"BAGGAGE THIEVES BAGGED -- After police staged a months-long undercover sting, five baggage handlers at Kennedy Airport were charged last week with stealing laptop computers, cameras, compact discs and cash from the checked bags of passengers, according to the Queens district attorney's office, which estimated the total value of the stolen goods to be $23,000. The baggage handlers who were charged in the thefts were employees of Swissport USA, which transports luggage and cargo from terminals to aircraft. Some of the stolen goods were sold to undercover detectives or on eBay, the online auction house. Since April, about two dozen employees of the Transportation Security Administration have been arrested on charges of stealing from checked bags at six airports. A STEP UP FOR SMALL JETS -- Most business travelers dislike the cramped seating, low ceilings and meager storage space on the 50-seat or smaller regional jets that major airlines deploy on short-haul routes. But lately, airlines have been ordering new models of narrow-body jets in the 70-to-100-seat range that offer more room, more seats and storage, and greater fuel efficiency than regional jets. Recently, for example, United Express, the United Airlines subsidiary, has started using new 70-seat Embraer 170's on its Washington-Dulles service to Houston and Indianapolis, and between Chicago and Indianapolis on flights operated for United Express by Chautauqua Airlines. WHERE AM I NOW, AGAIN? -- The thick pocket-size monthly American Express Executive Travel SkyGuide, which lists global airline schedules in exhaustive detail, is now available electronically in a service called eSkyGuide. The annual subscription is $19.99 for those who already subscribe to the print edition, which costs $79 a year and has more than 90,000 subscribers, said Janet Libert, the editor and publisher. Nonsubscribers can get the new electronic service -- for use on laptop computers, personal digital assistants and other personal electronic devices -- for $69.95 a year. ""Our subscribers are the real road warriors,"" Ms. Libert said. ""For example, they average 185 nights a year in hotels."" CHINA, HERE WE COME -- Domestic airlines are rushing to add or enhance nonstop service to China as demand grows sharply. On Sunday, United Airlines began daily nonstop service between O'Hare in Chicago and Pudong International Airport in Shanghai. ''United is the only U.S. airline to provide nonstop passenger service between the United States and mainland China,'' said Graham Atkinson, senior vice president for worldwide sales and alliances. United also flies nonstop between Shanghai and San Francisco, and serves Beijing daily from those cities. American Airlines said it was seeking regulatory approval to begin daily nonstop service between Chicago and Shanghai next May. Delta Air Lines said it filed for approval to begin daily nonstop service between Atlanta and Beijing in March 2006. And Continental filed for approval of daily nonstop service between its Newark hub and Beijing and Shanghai. Northwest Airlines serves China through its hub in Tokyo. J.F.K. LEADS THE WAY -- With an 8 percent spurt in traffic, Kennedy Airport in New York led the nation's top 25 airports in the rate of passenger traffic growth last year, a new study by the F.A.A. says. The reasons included more flights by JetBlue Airways, based at Kennedy, and continuing growth in international traffic. Kennedy handled 31.7 million passengers last year, ranking it 17th on the list of the top 25 busiest airports. The two busiest world airports were Atlanta Hartsfield (76.1 million passengers) and Chicago O'Hare (69.3 million).

4fd2a1ec8eb7c8105d8871e2,"TRAVEL writing has traditionally been an escapist genre, with a mandate to seduce; its natural subjects are pleasure, beauty, food, wine. All the senses are appealed to, and inconvenience and discomfort are purely vicarious. But in today's international climate, the tried-and-true staples of travel literature -- Provençal cuisine, Americans in Paris, the hill towns of Tuscany -- have come to seem not just irrelevant but boring. Tame. A handful of recent travel books, featuring subjects that range from the only slightly offbeat (revisionist looks at Germany and modern Greece) to the truly mind-stretching (Kyrgyzstan, the Gobi Desert, wartime Afghanistan, peacetime Iraq), have thoroughly trumped the standard travel literature this summer. In THE BELLS IN THEIR SILENCE: Travels Through Germany (Princeton University, $24.95), Michael Gorra wonders why no one in the Anglo-American world writes travel books (as opposed to journalism or reportage) about contemporary Germany. Clearly because the subject is too loaded with dark associations: one is always brought up against the Nazi era, ''that neutron star into whose bitter gravity all German history seems to fall.'' Not that Gorra can avoid the subject either. In fact, he is no more able than the hotelier Basil Fawlty, in the classic ''Fawlty Towers'' episode, to suppress Nazi stereotypes when dealing with ordinary Germans, even though most of the people he meets are too young to have had anything to do with the atrocities of the past. Despite this, Gorra has made a noble effort to write a truthful book that, while colorful and impressionistic, also draws thoughtful conclusions about what he encounters.",Travel; Arts; Books,2495,2004/06/06

And they seem to be edging out their male counterparts: the 16-year-old daughter of a friend just went to France for a month with a school group composed of 28 girls and 4 boys. One can hazard a few guesses why this might be so: traveling is a subspecies of self-improvement, and a voyage out is not infrequently also a voyage of self-discovery, one that requires a lot of navel-gazing and journal-writing, activities that most young men, unless they're aspiring rock stars, are disinclined to pursue. Of course, older women also hit the road, and at any age women experience the adventure of foreign places differently from men.

Before they rolled into place, in the innocent days when security just meant men with submachine guns, a travel book could be fluffy, silly, familiar or carefully manufactured, and it hardly mattered. Afterward, every destination acquired a sudden glow of hellfire, every trip an element of thoroughly unwanted suspense. Escape has become a problem in itself. A travel book without danger -- to the body, the soul or the future -- is entirely out of time. Such books, I can report, are still appearing. There are droll encounters with simple, cunning nut-brown persons, continent by continent, books where you can hear the jokes being harvested, cut and squeezed like dry lemons. Gentle novelists still jet to tourist spots, hoping a metaphor and a bit of reflection will make up for not quite seeing or understanding anything. Writers in their 20's try to get away with lyrical books about places they seem to think their parents never reached. No known force can stop the British freelancer from going abroad to live and assuming that it matters. American academics go abroad, it seems, mostly to buy chintz or terra cotta, but their books are just as long.

4fd27b938eb7c8105d841168,"Travel books can generally be divided into two categories. First there are the ones in which all the traveling is done in the journey to an intended destination, at which point the writer stays put. And then there are the books in which the writer never stops -- jetting, cycling, cruising or otherwise gamboling about -- often at breakneck, TGV speed. Miss Manners, a k a Judith Martin, is one of those who know where they like to go and don't deviate in their devotion. Her latest book, NO VULGAR HOTEL: The Desire and Pursuit of Venice (Norton, $24.95), takes its title from Henry James's novel ''The Wings of the Dove,'' whose heroine, Milly Theale, declares that in Venice she will stay in ''no vulgar hotel,'' but in ''some fine old rooms, wholly independent, for a series of months.'' As Martin puts it, ''Renting -- not necessarily a palace, but no vulgar hotel -- is also a requirement for savoring the living Venice'' and truly understanding the city.

For a goal, no matter how frivolous or unattainable, can lend tension to the most circuitous of trips and bring cohesion to the wildest string of anecdotes. Almost any goal will do -- or so a stack of new travel books suggests. The writer's quest can be a weighty affair: an investigation into the status of Africa's dwindling white enclaves or a comparison of post-revolutionary Iran with the country remembered from childhood. But it can also be fanciful: finding proof of the existence of the queen of Sheba or checking the accuracy of Asia's fortunetellers. The goal in question can even be a hedge. Yes, a hedge . . . albeit of an unusual sort, more than 2,500 miles long at the peak of its growth in the 1870's and requiring a staff of roughly 14,000 to keep in good trim.

4fd240cb8eb7c8105d7d8cf3,"TRAVEL writing seems to exist in a permanent state of near extinction. People who ponder the health of literary genres have assumed that in a world where anybody with enough money can launch an assault on Everest and intrepid octogenarians routinely hobble around the Galpagos, few would settle for merely reading about the experience. These days, many of our most popular travel books -- Frances Mayess paeans to Tuscany come to mind -- are not really travel books but lavish fantasias of home renovation, which only serve to confirm the fact that anyone with two weeks vacation and a credit card can join an eco-tour of the Costa Rican rain forest but a good team of construction workers, whether at home or abroad, is almost impossible to find. And yet real travel writing is far from being over. It should come as no surprise that its practitioners, who pride themselves on doing things other people wont and dont, are a plucky breed, with a capacity for self-invention that makes Madonna look stuck in a rut. Just a little more than 20 years ago (then as now, travel writing was thought to be in extremis), Bruce Chatwin published the genre-bending classic ''In Patagonia, which spawned a generation of travel writers whose M.O. consisted of going somewhere unexpected and simply wandering around, relying on their own eclectic interests and captivating personalities to float the narrative boat. We are now in the midst of a backlash. The ends of the earth have come to seem as exotic as the end of the block (consider this: the ladies of Weno, the seven-square-mile island capital of Chuuk, in Micronesia, are devotees of Victorias Secret), and our popular tastes have been dulled by a need for simplistic plots.

At the same time he has concluded that he cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt in court that her statements were ''knowingly false,'' and therefore will not pursue criminal charges against her. Judging from the voluminous public record, Mr. Ray's decision to drop the case is legally sound. Judging from the same record, his characterization of Mrs. Clinton's account of her role in the matter also seems on the mark. Except for new detail, the report adds little of substance to the preliminary findings Mr. Ray released in June. Our main quarrel with Mr. Ray involves timing -- that is, the decision to release the report only three weeks before voters go to the polls to choose between Mrs. Clinton and Rick Lazio in a closely contested Senate race. Mr. Ray and his staff argue that three weeks is enough time for the public to digest and debate the report and that delivering it earlier would have been procedurally difficult. But as the decision not to prosecute was made months ago, they could and should have avoided dropping reports during the September-October campaign season.

MORE CODE SHARING -- Continental Airlines will begin code sharing with Air France in a move to make it easier for its customers to connect to 12 destinations in Europe and the Middle East on Air France flights out of Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. Code-sharing arrangements allow passengers of one airline to book through to destinations served by a partner airline, using a single ticket. The destinations in France include Biarritz, Bordeaux, Marseille, Montpellier, Nantes, Strasbourg, Lyon, Nice and Toulouse. Other destinations are Vienna, Dubai and Porto, Portugal. The arrangement also extends Air France's reach in the United States to 21 additional destinations on Continental flights out of Houston and Newark.

However, most international fares went up. Average fares for domestic airlines on trans-Atlantic routes rose 5.6 percent, and on Pacific routes by 11.5 percent, the trade group said. The drops in average domestic fares started in 2001, when fares were 8.6 percent below the previous year. In 2002 and 2003, average fares declined 9 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. Meanwhile, airlines around the world operated nearly 2.25 million flights in January -- 88,000 more than in January 2002, according to OAG, a leading publisher of airline schedules.

4fd249828eb7c8105d7e6ef3,"FLYING CHEAPER -- Companies in the United States are paying the lowest average air fares for their employees since 1999, according to data from Eclipse Advisors, an American Express subsidiary that compiles a survey called the Business Travel Monitor. The reason is the intensifying competition between low-cost carriers and major carriers, and its pressure on popular routes, Eclipse said. The average one-way fare paid for a business trip on a basket of domestic routes studied by researchers was $217 in the third quarter, down 10 percent from the period a year earlier. Philadelphia provides one example of the impact of low-cost carriers; Southwest Airlines started operating there in May against US Airways. In the third quarter, the average fare for a business trip in Philadelphia fell 40 percent. RECORD TRAFFIC -- While fares stay low, domestic airlines are projected to carry a record 685 million passengers this year, while losing as much as $8 billion, according to industry data. ''Even with all those extra passengers, the airlines just haven't been able to break back into profitability, mainly because fuel prices are killing them,'' said David Swierenga, an economist who runs the consulting firm AeroEcon. The previous passenger traffic record was in 2000, when domestic airlines carried 666.1 million customers. That number fell to 622.2 million in 2001 and dropped again to 612.9 million in 2002 before beginning a recovery last year, when 646.5 million passengers flew on carriers based in the United States, according to the Air Transport Association. MINE'S FASTER -- At a certain niche in the corporate jet world, speed is considered the ultimate luxury. Flexjet, which sells partial ownerships of the jets it operates, recently claimed a certified world speed record for one of its aircraft, a Challenger 300, which took 4 hours and 41 minutes to get from Carlsbad, Calif., to Bangor, Me., carrying eight passengers at an average speed of 572 miles an hour. Not so fast, responded the Cessna Aircraft Company, which sells the Citation X, an aircraft that also carries about eight passengers and has long been regarded as the swiftest corporate jet of them all. The Citation X is rated at a top speed of Mach 0.92, while the Challenger 300 is rated at Mach 0.82. ''The Challenger 300 could have set a world record for that specific flight'' between those two points,'' said Jessica Myers, a Cessna spokeswoman. ''Just as the Challenger 300, the Citation X has also set many world records. The Citation X is the fastest nonmilitary jet in the world. It travels at 0.92 Mach, or over 600 m.p.h.''

4fd2497f8eb7c8105d7e6c7a,"ARE WE THERE YET? -- Flight delays increased in September, the federal Bureau of Transportation Statistics reported in its survey of 19 domestic carriers. The airlines' on-time arrivals averaged 83.9 percent in September, down from 85.6 percent a year earlier, the survey showed. September's figures, however, represented an improvement over the 78.3 percent on-time performance for August, the bureau said. AirTran Airways had the worst record, at 76.6 percent, followed by Delta, at 77 percent. Delta's Flight 1447 from Atlanta to Pensacola, Fla., was the most frequently delayed scheduled flight. The survey showed that it was late 84.6 percent of the time. AIR TRAVEL INCREASES -- World passenger traffic for the first nine months of this year grew 17.7 percent, compared with the period in 2003, the International Air Transport Association said. ''Every region is reporting double-digit growth'' from a weak 2003, said Giovanni Bisignani, the director general of the trade group. Airline operating costs are down, he said, except in one crucial area: fuel. ''If current fuel-price levels persist, losses may well exceed the $3 billion to $4 billion'' earlier forecast for 2004, he said. AIRBORNE STUN GUNS -- Taser International, the maker of electronic stun guns for zapping malefactors without killing them or firing bullets, said yesterday that it had received federal approval for use of the devices on commercial flights in the United States by crews of an international airline, which it declined to identify. ""This opens an exciting new market segment for Taser devices for specially trained personnel to defend passengers and aircraft against potential terrorist activities or passengers that present an imminent danger to the safety of aircraft in flight,"" the company's president, Tim Smith, said. A spokesman, Steve Tuttle, said that the Taser devices being tested for use on various airlines can fire electrical probes on wires at distances up to 21 feet, without risking damage to aircraft. Reuters identified the first carrier to get approval for their use as Korean Air, which it said had received permission to carry the stun guns on its approximately 50 weekly flights in the United States. TALKING TO AN ACTUAL PERSON -- The Internet has revolutionized the way that business travelers book flights and hotel rooms, but a large number of them still insist on making reservations the old-fashioned way, especially when making changes in their itineraries, according to a recent survey by Travelport Corporate Solutions, the travel-management unit of the Cendant Corporation. The survey's most important finding was that while 52 percent of American business travelers book their travel online, a third still use off-line channels -- including telephone calls to travel agents. The survey indicates that corporate travel-management companies ''must provide faster and easier-to-use online and automated options,'' said Charlotte Blackwell, Travelport's vice president for products and marketing.

CONSUMER CLOUT -- Business-travel advocates played the antitrust card in pressuring Northwest Airlines to retreat from a $7.50 surcharge for tickets booked on travel agencies' reservations systems. Northwest dropped the fee late last week under pressure from travel groups, though the refusal of other airlines to adopt the surcharge also played a part. Northwest's planned surcharge for roundtrip tickets amounted to an ''anticompetitive practice'' by presenting ''a clear invitation to Northwest's competitors to follow its lead and agree to this across-the-board price increase,'' Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, had said in a letter to the Justice Department. Carol A. Devine, president of the National Business Travel Association, whose executives met with Northwest two days before the fee was dropped, hailed the fee's repeal. Northwest will still charge a $5 fee for tickets purchased on its telephone system and $10 for those bought at airport counters.",Business,331,2004/09/07
4fd247f98eb7c8105d7e443a,"AIRLINE FOOD -- Two years after free meals became largely a memory (good or bad) in the coach cabins of many domestic flights, American Airlines is considering joining competitors that started selling meals to passengers after eliminating free meals during the post-9/11 slump in business. American said it would begin testing in-flight food sales in September on selected flights, including some between Dallas and New York and New York and Phoenix. Meals will cost $5 to $7. If the tests are successful and American expands the service throughout its domestic schedule, the airline, the world's largest, will join most major airlines and a handful of low-cost carriers in selling food in coach on some or all flights. (In business and first class, free meals are still the norm.) Among the major carriers, only Continental still serves free meals in coach on most domestic flights. FUEL PRICES -- The airlines insist they are not crying wolf about the trouble that high oil prices are causing. ''While the soaring price of fuel is a huge problem for the economy, it is rapidly becoming a catastrophe for the airline industry,'' according to a letter to Congress signed by the chairmen of most domestic airlines. The letter states that at current prices, the fuel bill this year for the nation's airlines will be $6 billion more than it would have been with last year's prices. The letter, sent under the aegis of the Air Transport Association, asks for oversight hearings to review the ''feverish speculation'' in oil markets. ''We are convinced,'' the letter says, ''that the only thing that will stop the wild increase in prices is fear by the speculators that the U.S. government is ready to step in with actions that could either increase supply or reduce demand.''",Business,560,2004/08/31

4fd24a458eb7c8105d7e7ec1,"EVOLVING TRAVEL EXPERIENCE -- Corporate travelers have become accustomed to booking trips on company intranet engines that calculate the best fares and strictly enforce travel cost-savings policies. In its early stages, corporate online booking was all about saving a few dollars on each fare, with little regard to the traveler's control. Now, because of better technology, that situation is changing, says David A. Falter, the president for corporate travel solutions for the Cendant Corporation. ''We think 2005 will show a rapid expansion for online booking in the corporate space,'' Mr. Falter said yesterday. Many business travelers complain that online corporate travel systems severely limit their choices on the road, but Mr. Falter said technology was advancing to go beyond ''commoditization'' air fares. ''The next generation in travel through online services is going to be, 'how do I give the traveler the self-serve opportunity throughout the travel experience' -- self-service with regard to changing travel plans'' using personal digital assistants and other devices while traveling. ''Online booking has changed the nature of how travel is started, but it has not changed the nature of how travel is conducted,'' he said. ''It's not just about saving money, it's about giving the corporate traveler the power.'' AIRPLANE SPACE RACE -- Will the workhorse wide-body airliner of the future be a huge double-decker plane? One such plane, the Airbus A380, is expected to be flying commercially next year, with enough room for 500 to more than 800 passengers, depending on the way airlines configure it. Another contender for workhorse of the air is the sleeker, more flexible and more modest 7E7 aircraft, still being developed by Boeing. Continental Airlines, the first domestic carrier to order the 7E7, has placed a big bet on the new aircraft, with 10 orders. The first of them is scheduled for delivery in 2009. Lawrence W. Kellner, Continental's president who is soon to succeed the retiring Gordon M. Bethune as chief executive, said, ''The 7E7 is the widebody of the future for Continental and will provide the platform for our long-term international growth.'' Airbus, the European aircraft maker, is preparing the A380 for its first demonstration flight this winter. Commercial flights are expected to begin next year. Airbus said it had 129 orders as of Nov. 30 for the new superjumbos. WINTER FARE SALES -- Get ready for a spate of winter fare sales.

Setting off the metal detector with as much as a forgotten quarter in a pocket automatically elicits an embarrassing public pat-down and electronic wanding. But this is not the drill for thousands of daily passengers who fly on corporate aircraft, which usually operate from private terminals at the 5,000 or so domestic airports that do not handle commercial air traffic. In the United States last year, according to industry statistics, more than 10,000 companies operated about 15,500 fixed-wing aircraft, ranging from two-seat turbo-prop planes to heavy-iron jet behemoths that can carry 40 or more passengers.",Business,1116,2003/10/28

Bombardier said the new model, to be available early next year, would have a range of 2,516 miles, about 275 miles more than the current version of the plane, which seats 70 to 78 passengers. The new model will carry ''greater payloads over greater distances,'' said Rod Williams, the vice president for aircraft programs at Bombardier's regional aircraft division. In recent years, domestic airlines have shifted larger shares of their capacity to small regional jets, which are usually configured only with coach seats. SeatGuru.com, a Web site that displays seating diagrams for jets in the fleets of various airlines, says of the CRJ700 models that ''many fliers find them to be generally uncomfortable'' because of narrow seats and cramped space. FLIGHT DELAY REDUX -- Seems like old times. The on-time performance rates of the largest domestic airlines dropped to 71.4 percent in January, from 74.9 percent a year earlier, according to the Transportation Department. The worst delays were at JetBlue Airways (where only 63.1 of flights arrived on time), followed by American Eagle (65.8 percent) and Comair (67.3 percent). The best: Hawaiian Airlines (92.6 percent), Continental Airlines (78 percent) and Southwest Airlines (75.6 percent). BUSINESS-CLASS SALE -- In a business-class fare sale, Continental Airlines ratcheted up competition for premium travel on about two dozen trans-Atlantic routes, where round-trip business class fares can typically range from $6,000 upward on many airlines. Some examples, based on 30-day advance purchase: Newark to Frankfurt, $1,550 round trip; Phoenix to Lisbon, $1,850. Outbound travel for these fares is from May 19 through Sept. 2, and all return trips must be made by Sept. 9. Details are at www.continental.com.

China Southern has flights to more than 80 cities around the world.

4fd25df38eb7c8105d80c81f,"EXPENSE ACCOUNT ALERT -- Almost half of the business travelers in Europe and the United States who were questioned in a survey released yesterday by American Express say their companies have tightened travel-spending policies over the last two to three years. More than a third say their travel and entertainment expense accounts are getting greater scrutiny. With good reason, apparently: more than a third believe it is either ''somewhat'' or ''quite'' common for business travelers to submit expense accounts with ''one or more completely false or bogus charges.'' But most road warriors also disapprove of such fraud. Those in the United States expressed the strongest support (77 percent) for careful audits of expense reports and receipts, while 72 percent in Britain agreed, as did 70 percent in Germany and 64 percent in France. For all their stepped-up vigilance, companies do seem to be loosening up on restrictions against traveling in style. In a survey conducted by the National Business Travel Association and the Travel Industry Association of America, the proportion of corporate travelers who reported their employers restricted the class they could travel on fell to 50 percent last year from 56 percent in 2002. The decline reflected a better economy and ''a departure from severe travel restrictions'' put into effect after the 2001 terrorist attacks, the survey said. UPGRADE UPHEAVAL -- As turmoil churns through airline elite-status programs, with many top-level members complaining that upgrades on major airlines have become more elusive this year, Continental Airlines is changing its upgrade policy to favor those who pay the highest coach fares and check in earliest online. Effective March 16, Continental said, priority for upgrades will be given to OnePass elite members traveling on full economy fares, based on elite status and time of check-in. Next in line will be those traveling on fares less than full economy, with priority based on elite level, then fare paid, and then time of check-in. The policy for companion travelers accompanying Platinum Elite members also is changing. Companion upgrades will be sorted by the status level of the elite member and by the time of check-in. For instance, Continental said in an e-mail message to its elite members, passengers accompanying a Platinum Elite member will be upgraded only after all other Platinum Elite members have received upgrades.

4fd29f5f8eb7c8105d882bfb,"The Church of Our Lady (Frauenkirche in German), a Protestant church constructed in Dresden under the rule of the Catholic Dukes of Saxony, symbolized 18th-century religious tolerance. The bell-shaped dome and unusual elevated choir produced legendary effects. Richard Wagner had the premiere of his ''Love Feast of the Apostles'' there in 1843. A masterpiece of German Baroque architecture, the church defined Dresden's skyline from 1743 until Feb. 13, 1945, when Allied bombers leveled most of the city. The 12,000-ton sandstone dome collapsed after two days of intense fires, and destroyed the famous ''Christ in Gethsemane'' altarpiece designed by Johann Christian Feige and an organ that Bach had played. Unable to pay for restoration, the cash-strapped East German government let the blackened ruins molder. In the early 1990's, an ambitious worldwide effort that included the New York-based Friends of Dresden began raising money to rebuild the church in time for Dresden's 800th anniversary in 2006.

''The good news is we're coming back to pre-9/11 levels,'' said James C. May, the president of the Air Transport Association.

A pair of small plastic Boeing 707's sit on my desk, alongside a Trans World Airlines swizzle stick with a streaking-707 silhouette. A mid-50's travel poster promoting T.W.A. flights to France hangs in my foyer. On the study wall is a lithograph of an early-60's T.W.A. 707.

Floods inundated Kampa Island in Mala Strana, a web of narrow streets and Baroque palaces below Prague Castle, but elsewhere in the historic center, the physical damage was limited largely to flooded cellars and weakened foundations -- and archives, libraries and storerooms. Electricity is coming back slowly to many flooded areas, but most are now open to pedestrians. Luxury hotels, such as the Four Seasons, the InterContinental and the Hilton, will be closed until at least the end of September, as will a handful of small hotels in the very center. But dozens are open, and several well situated luxury hotels were untouched, including the Grand Hotel Bohemia, the Alcron, Marriott and Renaissance.",,406,2002/09/15

But all anyone wanted, at the outset, was one glamorous photo in front of the Pyramids, the kind you associate with another era of fashion. Just a model, a dress and a monument made five millennia ago. Why, we wondered, don't we see more of that in fashion? Certainly, ancient Egypt was the first place to take fashion edicts from the 5,000-year-old equivalent of Nicole Kidman: copies of the royals' makeup holders and hand mirrors were found in the laborers' quarters, and the ancient knock-off version of her Academy Awards dress. The ancients routinely wore sheer, see-through linens -- proof of the wearers' wealth -- racier than anything worn today. Isis is depicted in Nefertari's tomb in the original Rudi Gernreich. And the first known eye makeup was used there: Kohl ground with malachite for green eye shadow, and galena for gray. There's a reason why Las Vegas, land of ersatz glamour, named its hotels the Sahara, the Sands, the Luxor. A trip down the Nile is the definition of an odyssey. Odysseus himself ventured to the Nile in the voyage that gave such voyages their name. It's a trip that imprints itself for life on every person who takes it.

4fd2a64c8eb7c8105d88e486,"MAJOR CARRIERS GAIN -- Network carriers are reclaiming a bigger share of business travelers from low-cost carriers, according to a survey by Accenture, the consulting company. Last month, 82 percent of business travelers said they were now ''primarily'' using major airlines, up from 72 percent a year ago, according to the survey, which reported a ''significant shift'' back to major network carriers over the past year for both business and personal travel. For business travelers, a shift back to network carriers reflects a loosening of corporate travel policies in an improved economy, Paul Chiu, the head of travel and tourist research for Accenture, said in an interview. Business travelers now have ''more flexibility to pick airlines and flights more conducive to their schedules and destinations, rather than selecting them strictly on price,'' he said. A third of business travelers surveyed said they expected to travel more in the next six months than they did in the comparable period last year, while a little over half said their travel frequency would be about the same. RADIO-FREE PASSPORTS? -- Corporate travel managers are uneasy about the State Department's plan to introduce passports later this year that will have tiny radio tags for transmitting personal and facial-biometric information, to expedite processing of travelers through border controls and Customs checkpoints. The Association of Corporate Travel Executives has polled its members and found that ''93 percent of them are opposed to this,'' said Jack Riepe, a spokesman for the group. The reason is that radio frequency identification, or RFID, devices -- similar to radio tags used in inventory management of manufactured goods -- can broadcast ''the presence of U.S. citizens in crowds, in hotel lobbies, on trains or even on the street to those in possession of a fairly unsophisticated receiver,'' according to a statement by the group. The main concern is about politically motivated attacks on United States citizens abroad, but the devices ''could also be pinpointing likely targets for pickpockets and thieves,'' said Greeley Koch, the group's president. ''The problem is that anyone can activate these things,'' which can be read from as far as 100 feet away, said Bill Scannell, a consultant on privacy who is organizing opposition to the proposal on a Web site, www.RFIDkills.com. AUTOMATED CHECK-INS -- Domestic hotels are slowly following the lead of airlines in giving customers options for automated check-ins. Last year, Hilton Hotels tested self-service kiosks at several major hotels, and by year's end had them installed at 44 hotels. Hilton is now installing registration kiosks at all of its 175 Embassy Suites hotels. Others installing or testing kiosks are the Global Hyatt Corporation, which is putting them into 100 Hyatt Regency and Grand Hyatt hotels this year; Starwood Hotels and Resorts, which is installing kiosks in more than 100 Sheraton hotels; and Holiday Inn, a unit of Lodgian, which is testing a kiosk at its Gwinnett Center property in Georgia that will also allow guests to print out airline boarding passes. ''Initial expectations have been met that this is a viable means for customers to expedite check-ins,'' while still having access to personalized front desk service if desired, Thomas B.

More than 80 percent of the corporate and third-party travel managers polled said they expected their 2005 business-travel spending to increase (34 percent) or stay the same (49 percent). The survey, which also polled 1,200 individual travelers, found that the top two pet peeves on flights were people who carry on bulky bags that should have been checked (32 percent cited this) and babies who cry (13 percent). Managers thought the main problems would be long security lines (29 percent) and resentment that others were paying less on the same flight (19 percent).

PARKING LOT FEVER -- You better act fast if you want to find a cheap place to park your car near a big airport over the busy holiday season. ''This was the absolute record; we were at two and a half times last year's numbers,'' Tom Lombardi said yesterday about the Thanksgiving holiday demand for parking spaces at the 160 private lots near 60 airports in North America that can be reserved on his Web site (AirportParkingReservations.com). The Christmas rush is shaping up the same way, said Mr. Lombardi, who started the company in 2000 to help travelers find discounted off-site parking lots that provide free shuttle service to terminals. Over Thanksgiving, he said, about 25 of the parking lots listed on the site were sold out ''and at about another 25, I had to call them and tell them, you guys need to honor these reservations, so they went out and found auxiliary parking.'' A word to the prudent for Christmas reservations: because of the demand, he said, ''a lot of them are raising prices.'' So book early. KEEPING MILES SIMPLE -- International airlines have been adding code-share partners in arrangements that make it easier for travelers to connect on airlines seamlessly while keeping their frequent-flier benefits in one basket. Singapore Airlines, for example, recently expanded its code-share alliance with Lufthansa. Starting tomorrow, a total of 77 weekly connections operated by Lufthansa will be available between Frankfurt and four cities in Spain: Barcelona, Bilbao, Madrid and Málaga. The expansion means that Singapore and Lufthansa will operate code-share services to 33 worldwide destinations, an increase from the current 28. Under the new agreement, Lufthansa will also share codes on some daily Singapore flights between Bangkok and Singapore. Under these agreements, passengers are able to book flights through one airline on a code-sharing partner airline, while choosing to compile their frequent-flier benefits in either airline. MILES-HIGH SHOPPING CLUB -- There is a new in-flight shopping holiday promotion on America West Airlines. Passengers who order onboard from the SkyMall catalog receive either 10 frequent flier miles for every dollar spent or $20 off on any order of $60 or more.

If you've flown in one -- soaring at a turbulence-free 50,000 feet near the speed of sound, breathing abundant fresh air in a cabin as comfortable as a living room, able to leap from exit door to car without making that death march through some vast dingy airport -- you know why there are 8,000 corporate jets now under registry. Or why there is an industry backlog of several years for new orders for most top models. And other companies are creating a big new market by acquiring a supply of corporate jets and essentially dispatching them, like airborne rental limousines, to customers who buy shares in the venture.",Technology; Business,833,1999/09/15

The whole point of travel writing is -- or was -- to describe a place few people have visited before. Until quite recently, the earth offered many such places, unworked mines whose fat, tempting seams promised treasures to any brave soul with a strong back and a pick. Airplane travel and the cheap package tour put an end to all that. Now Tashkent, Nairobi and Kuala Lumpur all lie within a day's reach of New York.

Among the volumes that accompany travelers who lived before the era of prepackaged adventure expeditions and up-market hiking-and-bingeing tours of Provence, one of the most interesting is Peter Raby's BRIGHT PARADISE (Princeton University, paper, $14.95), which follows a now-extinct species -- Victorian scientists -- in their quest for the specimens that would shake humankind's complacency about its place in the natural order.

Most travel writers these days seem to have adopted a persona of blissful ignorance. Whether it's true or not, they write as if they were explorers stepping into unknown territory, sharing their adventures -- always unexpected -- with a readership they seem to think is as wide-eyed and apparently gullible as they are.

From Estonia to Mongolia, it was potentially a traveler's bonanza. Ancient cities like Samarkand, Bukhara and Tashkent, free of the bureaucratic quagmire of Homo sovieticus, winked invitingly at adventurous beachcombers. Appealingly, this would not turn out to be a one-way traffic. For once, the travel writer, sometimes criticized for being a selfish loner evading domestic responsibilities and plundering poorer countries for the glory of his own ego, could be making a real contribution to the country he was in. These new republics needed stories; their people, in the urgent task of finding new identities, needed reacquainting with both old and recent myths.

A charming and beautifully decorated collection of 11 rooms meanders through the two buildings that housed the restaurant on a side street in the Medina (old city). The accommodations, all different, range from a small room with a queen-size bed and a private patio to large bedrooms with living room and terrace dripping oleander and bougainvillea on the top floor, affording a view of the city. All have sleek marble bathrooms furnished with thick towels and bathrobes. The public areas, filled with antiques and artifacts, are ornamented with carved cedar and plaster in typical Moroccan style. The staff members wear traditional Moroccan dress. The new hotel is more elaborate than the famous namesake restaurant, which was the first in the Medina to serve fine Moroccan food while catering to Europeans when it opened in 1947. The restaurant was owned by Suzy Larochette, who came to Marrakesh for health reasons with her mother and sister in 1938; they were stranded there when World War II broke out. Through her well-placed contacts, she got the pasha of Marrakesh, Si Thami el Glaoui, to provide a chef for the restaurant from his entourage. In its heyday, the restaurant welcomed such notables as Winston Churchill and the Aga Khan. Three years ago, a French-Italian entrepreneur, Fabrizio Ruspoli, and his partner, Philippe Cluzel, started talking with Ms. Larochette who, though nearly 90, is as feisty, opinionated and stylish as ever. ''He seemed classy,'' Ms. Larochette said of Mr. Ruspoli.

The Inn at Montchanin Village, which opened 22 of its planned 37 rooms and suites in June, is a cluster of simple structures, as befits their history; but interiors are lavish, with windows draped in elegant fabrics, bathrooms paved with marble. The decor takes some unexpected turns -- in the lobby, zebra-striped pillows are tucked into couches covered in a jungle print, and in the 55-seat restaurant, Krazy Kat's, the feline theme extends to the brocade in the waiters' vests. The inn, owned by the proprietors of a well-regarded local restaurant, the Back Burner in Hockessin, is a stone's throw from Winterthur, the decorative arts museum, and Hagley Museum and Library, the former DuPont powder works. It is a work in progress, with three major buildings currently being restored to house accommodations and meeting rooms. Two caveats: the sloping six-acre property could pose problems for guests with limited mobility, and it is situated at a well-traveled intersection, with some rooms facing the road. There is a train station dating to 1889 nearby, which has been converted into a food shop, and freight trains come through occasionally.",,263,1996/10/13

Cartan Tours, the official United States agency, said that Olympic committee rules gave priority to those who applied by April 30, then to those applying between May 1 and Sept. 15 and then to those who apply now through next Jan. 31. In all cases, Cartan said, ticket distribution for particular events is determined by a random selection by computer. If you do not have room reservations or family or friends in Australia, do not be surprised if you wind up in anything from a college dorm to a campground. But even that will be expensive, and probably a long commute to the event. Although 11,000 new hotel rooms are expected to be ready by September, there will be only 35,000 rooms for the expected 250,000-plus visitors. And 80 percent of those are reserved for Olympic officials and visitors on packages that usually include games tickets, air fare and lodging. The cheapest such package from Cartan, at $4,900, includes six nights at a private home.

As air traffic has rebounded, delays are at levels last seen in 2000, Kenneth M. Mead, the inspector general of the Transportation Department, told the committee.

4fd23afc8eb7c8105d7cfce1,"Deadline at Hand For Baggage Screening When the ball drops at midnight tonight, a new era in air travel will begin. That is the deadline for the Transportation Security Administration to begin screening all checked bags for explosives at all 429 domestic commercial airports. The bag-screening law imposed by Congress was modified as tonight's deadline approached and adequate bomb-detecting machines were not in place at most big airports. The new rules, patched together to prevent chaotic backups that had been predicted if full electronic screening were required immediately, allow T.S.A. employees at a number of major airports to inspect checked bags using a combination of electronic scanning machines, bomb-sniffing dogs and hand searches.",Business,355,2002/12/31

At least two cruise lines are offering excursions that include stays in the city before and during Mardi Gras. The Delta Queen Steamboat Company's 174-passenger Delta Queen leaves New Orleans on Feb. 27 for a seven-night cruise that first heads up the Mississippi River to Oak Alley Plantation, built in 1884.

But anyone itching to download or fire off an e-mail message before boarding may have to do some sleuthing to find a place to log on. Although most major airports in the United States offer passengers some way to connect to the Internet -- through stand-alone kiosks, pay phones with data ports, private business centers or wireless networks -- it takes a degree of serendipity and often technical prowess to handle a task that is becoming as essential as checking voice mail on the road.",Technology; Business,1192,2002/12/24

4fd289098eb7c8105d85a9b3,"No sooner was the Brandenburg Gate, symbol of a unified Germany, unveiled last month after nearly two years of repairs than the street that runs through it was permanently closed to traffic. ''As the Brandenburg Gate and the neighboring Reichstag building are the two most popular sites in Berlin, we heartily applaud this decision,'' said Natascha Kompatzki, a spokeswoman for the Berlin tourist office. ''People can take photographs in peace from every angle now.'' The celebrated gate, on the east side of the Pariser Platz, has not always been easy to admire. From 1961 to 1989 it remained in view but in a cordoned-off area behind the wall, inaccessible from either East or West Berlin. Renovations in 1990-1 and 2000-2 buried the monument under scaffolding and plastic sheets. The recently completed restoration used laser technology to clean years of grime from the neo-Classical facade. In the post-wall period, the Brandenburg Gate has once again become a place for parades, concerts and ceremonies. Built between 1789 and 1791 and modeled after the Propylaea arch that leads to the Acropolis in Athens, it is 66 feet high and 215 feet wide. The gate is crowned by a statue of Nike, the winged goddess of victory, driving a four-horse chariot. CORINNE LaBALME",,211,2002/11/17

Interestingly, in an indication of how downtown Orlando appeals to business travelers, 47 percent of visitors say that dining out is their first choice for a leisure activity.

In one highlight, the Akita Kantou Matsuri, or festival of the Akita prefecture, more than two dozen performers will create a moving light spectacle as they walk with lantern-laden poles balanced on their backs, foreheads and palms. The lantern-balancing, in which those in the procession pass the 120-pound poles off to one another, is performed each year in central Japan to ward off evil spirits before the August obon season, which honors ancestors.
