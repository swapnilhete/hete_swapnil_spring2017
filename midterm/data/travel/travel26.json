Delta scheduled 135,089 domestic nonstops for February (on planes with a total of 13.6 million seats.) That is 15.8 percent of the total domestic nonstop flights. American, the operating unit of AMR, was second with 119,661 nonstops and 12.7 million seats, a 14 percent market share. Next were United, the operating unit of UAL, with 96,796 domestic nonstops with 9.6 million seats, for an 11.3 percent market share. Then came US Airways (89,585 nonstops with 7.5 million seats and a 10.5 percent market share), and Southwest (78,194 nonstops with 10.6 million seats and a 9.2 percent market share), OAG said. MORE CODE SHARING -- Continental Airlines will begin code sharing with Air France in a move to make it easier for its customers to connect to 12 destinations in Europe and the Middle East on Air France flights out of Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. Code-sharing arrangements allow passengers of one airline to book through to destinations served by a partner airline, using a single ticket. The destinations in France include Biarritz, Bordeaux, Marseille, Montpellier, Nantes, Strasbourg, Lyon, Nice and Toulouse. Other destinations are Vienna, Dubai and Porto, Portugal. The arrangement also extends Air France's reach in the United States to 21 additional destinations on Continental flights out of Houston and Newark. FUELING BUSINESS JETS -- In another indication of the sharp growth in the use of corporate jets, the Business Jet Center at Oakland International Airport in California, which serves corporate aviation in the Bay Area, completed construction of a facility that increases capacity for storing aviation fuel by 300 percent. ''Our customer base is increasing rapidly,'' said Sheila Opitz, the general manager of the Business Jet Center, which also recently completed a $4 million renovation of its executive terminal. Meanwhile, Bombardier said yesterday it increased aircraft deliveries last year to 329, from 323, and cited increased demand for business jets. In all, business jet deliveries were up 44 percent over the previous year, the manufacturer, based in Montreal, said. AMERICAN ADDS FLIGHTS -- American Airlines, the operating unit of AMR Corporation, citing rising passenger demand, said that it and its regional affiliate, American Eagle, were adding 12 daily flights from airports in the New York area. These include five flights between La Guardia Airport and Atlanta starting June 9, five between La Guardia and Charlotte, N.C., starting May 1 and two between Kennedy International and St. Louis, also starting May 1. BUSINESS MEETING FAVORITES -- According to a new survey of 900 professional meetings planners by Yesawich, Pepperdine, Brown & Russell, the five favorite cities in the United States for corporation and association meetings are San Diego; Orlando, Fla.; San Francisco; Chicago; and Phoenix. The top five criteria for choosing a destination, according to the study, are the ability to make the agenda relevant, hotel-resort convention support staff, room rates, accessibility of destination by air, and cost of food, drink and entertainment. REGISTERED TRAVELER PROGRAM -- Orlando International Airport in Florida will be the site of the first attempt to expedite security check-in for registered travelers. Participants will receive expedited clearance after completing an application and providing biometric data like fingerprints and iris identification.

TRAVELERS' TOP FEARS -- Americans dread getting sick or injured on the road more than any other travel threat, according to a survey commissioned by the Chubb Group of Insurance Companies. Nearly three-quarters (73.5 percent) of 1,500 travelers questioned by Impulse Research of Los Angeles cited medical emergencies as their top concern, followed by the risk of being robbed (30.7 percent) and the fear of a terrorist attack (23.4 percent). BYE-BYE BEDSPREAD -- The Marriott hotels are changing beds -- 628,000 of them. Marriott International says that by the end of this year beds at 2,400 hotels, operated under eight brand names, will be remade with triple sheets and plusher mattresses. Traditional bedspreads will be replaced by down comforters with removable duvet covers that will be freshly laundered for each guest visit. FLIGHTS UP, FARES DOWN -- Average domestic fares fell 4.2 percent in 2004 over 2003, reflecting continuing downward pressure on revenues for domestic airlines, according to the Air Transport Association. However, most international fares went up. Average fares for domestic airlines on trans-Atlantic routes rose 5.6 percent, and on Pacific routes by 11.5 percent, the trade group said. The drops in average domestic fares started in 2001, when fares were 8.6 percent below the previous year. In 2002 and 2003, average fares declined 9 percent and 0.8 percent respectively. Meanwhile, airlines around the world operated nearly 2.25 million flights in January -- 88,000 more than in January 2002, according to OAG, a leading publisher of airline schedules. United States carriers accounted for almost a third of the additional flights, OAG said.
