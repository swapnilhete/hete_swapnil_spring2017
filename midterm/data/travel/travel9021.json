But now, if some writers are to be believed, one leaves home in order to have terrifying experiences, perilous near misses from which one barely escapes with one's life. The authors of this season's travel books represent the whole range -- from explorers of yesteryear to modern daredevils facing exotic natural disasters and confronting (or provoking) the ire of justifiably suspicious locals, unaware that they are about to wind up as characters in a book. Among the volumes that accompany travelers who lived before the era of prepackaged adventure expeditions and up-market hiking-and-bingeing tours of Provence, one of the most interesting is Peter Raby's BRIGHT PARADISE (Princeton University, paper, $14.95), which follows a now-extinct species -- Victorian scientists -- in their quest for the specimens that would shake humankind's complacency about its place in the natural order.

Travel writers seem to be either writers who travel or travelers who write, and this year's collection contains the extreme products of both. Yet two books of sustained and grueling endeavor manage, in the end, to transcend their lusterless writing by the sheer doggedness and drama of the journey. David Halsey's MAGNETIC NORTH: A Trek Across Canada (illustrated, 252 pp., Sierra Club, $19.95) begins as such a jejune and episodic venture that it almost forfeits the reader's attention. Halsey, a young American who idolized the great explorers of the past, chose to record his expedition in logbook style, with its inherent dangers of desultoriness and plodding. The story is interspersed with letters to his family that would have been better left unprinted and with interpolations from his editor, Diana Landau -- this is a posthumous book -- that at first sound heavily reverential.", "headline": {"main": "TRAVEL"}, "_id": "4fd19ea38eb7c8105d6b1dca", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/02/books/travel.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Whatever happened to the know-it-all travel book?

Handy guides to every imaginable backwater continue to flourish, telling what's open when, and where to find a decent -- or not so decent -- hotel.

But where are those solid, seasoned (and often all too deadly) studies of a region by an old hand who knows the place cold -- past, present and future -- and wants to get every bit of it into one hefty book? Most travel writers these days seem to have adopted a persona of blissful ignorance. Whether it's true or not, they write as if they were explorers stepping into unknown territory, sharing their adventures -- always unexpected -- with a readership they seem to think is as wide-eyed and apparently gullible as they are. It's a technique that educates the writer as much, if not more, than the reader, and it works best in exotic, unfamiliar settings.

But then, just as travel was clearly becoming a commonplace and the world was running out of new areas to explore, suddenly, unpredictably, the Soviet Union broke up, its ebb tide leaving vast tracts exposed. From Estonia to Mongolia, it was potentially a traveler's bonanza. Ancient cities like Samarkand, Bukhara and Tashkent, free of the bureaucratic quagmire of Homo sovieticus, winked invitingly at adventurous beachcombers. Appealingly, this would not turn out to be a one-way traffic. For once, the travel writer, sometimes criticized for being a selfish loner evading domestic responsibilities and plundering poorer countries for the glory of his own ego, could be making a real contribution to the country he was in. These new republics needed stories; their people, in the urgent task of finding new identities, needed reacquainting with both old and recent myths. Because of the often dire economics of these places, and their citizens' lack of experience and research tools, it would be foreigners who would start the process -- as well as communicate what they found to the wider world, in the true tradition of Marco Polo.", "headline": {"kicker": "CHRISTMAS BOOKS '94", "main": "TRAVEL"}, "_id": "4fd1c4738eb7c8105d6f4057", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/04/books/christmas-books-94-travel.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel magazine, which has grown rapidly since its introduction two years ago, is being bought by Newsweek for an undisclosed amount.
