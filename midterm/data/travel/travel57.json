The series is being conducted by Paul Daniel, the departing music director, directed by Phyllida Lloyd and designed by Richard Hudson. The opening production is ''The Rhinegold,'' the first new staging in English for over 30 years . It will be followed by ''The Valkyrie'' in May, ''Siegfried'' in November and ''Twilight of the Gods'' in spring 2005. Built by Sir Oswald Stoll in 1904 to a design by Frank Matcham, the Coliseum survived a 1,000-pound bomb that fell through the roof onto the stage in 1941 but failed to explode. Beginning in 1947, American musicals such as ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' ''Guys and Dolls'' and ''The Pajama Game'' played there.
