GUIDEBOOK Nights Out Guidebooks are generally broken down by such classifications as region and price. Now Frommer's has a series focusing on the time of day. Its By Night guides describe nocturnal life in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Manhattan, New Orleans, Miami, Chicago, London and Paris. The pocket-sized paperbacks, $12.95 each, offer suggestions on music and dance clubs, cultural activities, late-night restaurants, bars and more risque pursuits. Guides on Amsterdam and Las Vegas are expected to be in bookstores by December. To order, call Macmillan at (800) 428-5331.

Its Connoisseur Class seats (between first class and economy) on Flight 895, between Chicago and Hong Kong, are now equipped with a device called a Backcycler, which automatically moves the lumbar area with the goal of easing lower-back strain and improving circulation. United plans to have Backcyclers installed in all Connoisseur Class seats on its North American and Latin American flights by the end of 1997, and on all Pacific flights by the end of 1998.", "headline": {"kicker": "TRAVEL ADVISORY", "main": "TRAVEL ADVISORY"}, "_id": "4fd1cccf8eb7c8105d7037ec", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/27/travel/travel-advisory-913618.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "SHIPS AND SHIPPING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CRUISES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "A village that housed workers at DuPont powder mills and factories in the 19th century is being converted into one of the more luxurious lodgings in the Brandywine Valley near Wilmington, Del.

The decor takes some unexpected turns -- in the lobby, zebra-striped pillows are tucked into couches covered in a jungle print, and in the 55-seat restaurant, Krazy Kat's, the feline theme extends to the brocade in the waiters' vests. The inn, owned by the proprietors of a well-regarded local restaurant, the Back Burner in Hockessin, is a stone's throw from Winterthur, the decorative arts museum, and Hagley Museum and Library, the former DuPont powder works. It is a work in progress, with three major buildings currently being restored to house accommodations and meeting rooms. Two caveats: the sloping six-acre property could pose problems for guests with limited mobility, and it is situated at a well-traveled intersection, with some rooms facing the road.
