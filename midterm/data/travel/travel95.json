''People can take photographs in peace from every angle now.'' The celebrated gate, on the east side of the Pariser Platz, has not always been easy to admire. From 1961 to 1989 it remained in view but in a cordoned-off area behind the wall, inaccessible from either East or West Berlin. Renovations in 1990-1 and 2000-2 buried the monument under scaffolding and plastic sheets. The recently completed restoration used laser technology to clean years of grime from the neo-Classical facade. In the post-wall period, the Brandenburg Gate has once again become a place for parades, concerts and ceremonies. Built between 1789 and 1791 and modeled after the Propylaea arch that leads to the Acropolis in Athens, it is 66 feet high and 215 feet wide. The gate is crowned by a statue of Nike, the winged goddess of victory, driving a four-horse chariot.
