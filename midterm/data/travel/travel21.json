For a goal, no matter how frivolous or unattainable, can lend tension to the most circuitous of trips and bring cohesion to the wildest string of anecdotes. Almost any goal will do -- or so a stack of new travel books suggests. The writer's quest can be a weighty affair: an investigation into the status of Africa's dwindling white enclaves or a comparison of post-revolutionary Iran with the country remembered from childhood. But it can also be fanciful: finding proof of the existence of the queen of Sheba or checking the accuracy of Asia's fortunetellers. The goal in question can even be a hedge. Yes, a hedge . . . albeit of an unusual sort, more than 2,500 miles long at the peak of its growth in the 1870's and requiring a staff of roughly 14,000 to keep in good trim. And no, it's not a cousin to the ''shrubbery'' of ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail,'' but a far more serious business, as the British book conservator and former tea planter Roy Moxham discovers in THE GREAT HEDGE OF INDIA (Carroll & Graf, $22).", "keywords": [{"value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE", "name": "subject"}, {"value": "TRAVEL AND VACATIONS", "name": "subject"}], "headline": {"main": "TRAVEL"}}, {"slideshow_credits": null, "document_type": "article", "_id": "4fd2693b8eb7c8105d820174", "section_name": "Business", "news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk", "print_page": "8", "multimedia": [{"url": "images/2006/02/28/business/28kids.751.jpg", "subtype": "thumbnail", "legacy": {"hasthumbnail": "Y", "thumbnailheight": 75, "thumbnail": "images/2006/02/28/business/28kids.751.jpg"}, "height": 75, "type": "image"}], "subsection_name": null, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/28/business/28kids.html", "source": "The New York Times", "abstract": "Professionals say art of traveling with children requires balancing business responsibilities with need to make sure children get proper care; most parents who take their children on road claim that stressful moments are usually outweighed by benefits; National Business Travel Association survey finds that of 210.5 million business trips taken in 2004, 10 percent involved adults with children, with women more likely than men to take their children; adds only about 20 percent of female business executives take their children along; some executives who have taken children on trips comment; photo (M)", "snippet": "Professionals say the art of traveling with children requires balancing business responsibilities with the need to make sure children get proper care....", "blog": [], "type_of_material": "News", "byline": {"original": "By PERRY GARFINKEL", "person": [{"firstname": "Perry", "rank": 1, "role": "reported", "organization": "", "lastname": "GARFINKEL"}]}, "pub_date": "2006-02-28T00:00:00Z", "word_count": 1015, "lead_paragraph": "The novelist Geraldine Brooks learned a hard lesson about child care on a book tour in New Zealand when her son was just a year old.

People who ponder the health of literary genres have assumed that in a world where anybody with enough money can launch an assault on Everest and intrepid octogenarians routinely hobble around the Galpagos, few would settle for merely reading about the experience. These days, many of our most popular travel books -- Frances Mayess paeans to Tuscany come to mind -- are not really travel books but lavish fantasias of home renovation, which only serve to confirm the fact that anyone with two weeks vacation and a credit card can join an eco-tour of the Costa Rican rain forest but a good team of construction workers, whether at home or abroad, is almost impossible to find. And yet real travel writing is far from being over. It should come as no surprise that its practitioners, who pride themselves on doing things other people wont and dont, are a plucky breed, with a capacity for self-invention that makes Madonna look stuck in a rut. Just a little more than 20 years ago (then as now, travel writing was thought to be in extremis), Bruce Chatwin published the genre-bending classic ''In Patagonia, which spawned a generation of travel writers whose M.O. consisted of going somewhere unexpected and simply wandering around, relying on their own eclectic interests and captivating personalities to float the narrative boat. We are now in the midst of a backlash. The ends of the earth have come to seem as exotic as the end of the block (consider this: the ladies of Weno, the seven-square-mile island capital of Chuuk, in Micronesia, are devotees of Victorias Secret), and our popular tastes have been dulled by a need for simplistic plots. We now require a gimmick, an angle, a concept -- the exact things an adventure in the Chatwinesque mode was guaranteed not to have.
