Blouin MacBain had clashed over financing. ''It was just time,'' he said. He added that he had never planned on putting out a magazine for someone else for the rest of his life, and that Culture + Travel was unfinished business from his tenure as editorial director at Cond\u00e9 Nast, where the ownership had abandoned his idea for a high-end art and lifestyle magazine. ''I think it was much more a coda to what I had done before than the start of a new career,'' he said by phone. ''It is not as if I want to spend another 18 years as an employee of someone else.'' Instead, Mr. Truman said he had been in conversation with a financial backer to open his own media company. ''Old media models are fading, and new ones are coming on,'' he said. ''It is more of an open field than it has ever been, and if one's expertise is in that area, it would be a good time to find new opportunities.''
