The longtime three-star restaurant Pic, in Valence, was reduced to two stars, leaving the number of three-star establishments in France at 20. Other significant changes include the demotion of Andre Daguin's restaurant, France, in Auch, from two stars to one; and the awarding of a single star to a Parisian fish restaurant, Paul Minchelli.
