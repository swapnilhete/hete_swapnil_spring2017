The new fees caused controversy because entry fees were specifically ruled out when the park was established in 1956 with a gift of 5,000 acres from Laurance Rockefeller. The Virgin Islands park imposed the fees as part of a three-year National Park Service program to pay for repairs and improvements. Entrance fees have been instituted in parks that had been free, and other fees, particularly for automobiles in the most popular parks in the West, have been increased.

But this time it's a hotel. A charming and beautifully decorated collection of 11 rooms meanders through the two buildings that housed the restaurant on a side street in the Medina (old city). The accommodations, all different, range from a small room with a queen-size bed and a private patio to large bedrooms with living room and terrace dripping oleander and bougainvillea on the top floor, affording a view of the city. All have sleek marble bathrooms furnished with thick towels and bathrobes. The public areas, filled with antiques and artifacts, are ornamented with carved cedar and plaster in typical Moroccan style. The staff members wear traditional Moroccan dress. The new hotel is more elaborate than the famous namesake restaurant, which was the first in the Medina to serve fine Moroccan food while catering to Europeans when it opened in 1947. The restaurant was owned by Suzy Larochette, who came to Marrakesh for health reasons with her mother and sister in 1938; they were stranded there when World War II broke out. Through her well-placed contacts, she got the pasha of Marrakesh, Si Thami el Glaoui, to provide a chef for the restaurant from his entourage. In its heyday, the restaurant welcomed such notables as Winston Churchill and the Aga Khan. Three years ago, a French-Italian entrepreneur, Fabrizio Ruspoli, and his partner, Philippe Cluzel, started talking with Ms. Larochette who, though nearly 90, is as feisty, opinionated and stylish as ever. ''He seemed classy,'' Ms. Larochette said of Mr. Ruspoli. She sold them the two houses but made them agree not to put in a restaurant because she lives in an adjacent house and did not want the noise. Nonetheless, those who stay at La Maison Arabe will get an early wake-up from the 5 A.M. call to prayer over loudspeakers from the Bab Doukkala mosque across the alley. La Maison Arabe, 1 Derb Assehbe-Bab Doukkala, Marrakesh; telephone (212-4) 39-12-33, fax (212-4) 44-37-15. Rooms range from $139 to $266 from June 14 through Dec. 9 and $181 to $320 the rest of the year, including breakfast and afternoon Moroccan tea. Most rooms are air-conditioned; all have heating and cable television.
