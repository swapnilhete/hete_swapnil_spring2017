If you could send mine and Paco Wood's if he has not recieved it yet to the
same address.  Send it to 9730 townpark drive. suite 100.  I am moving my
bussiness so if you can try and send it by friday.

John, you should have received a copy of the e-mail you sent to Jeff, which I 
in turn forwarded to Greg Whalley.  To bring you up to speed - Greg Whalley 
is the Chairman & CEO of Enron Net Works - EnronOnline and all IT resides in 
this business unit (in some of the e-mails in the string you sent me, Jay 
Fitzgerald and Jenny Rub were mentioned - they both report to Greg).  If you 
don't hear from him within a reasonable amount of time, please let me know.

Hope all is well...

Subject: Last call for tickets


Various Beta Buttheads,
   OK, the deadline is fast approaching.  We're inside two minutes to play
and I need to know the game plan.  As of this day Oct. 2, here's what I have
confirmed in tickets ordered so that we all may sit together at this year's
homecoming game:
Mannino/1, Beek/1, Jordan/1, Artie/1, Wallace/1, Elvis/2, Grumbles/2,
Glass/3, Chuckles/1, J. Miller/2, Shack/1, Space/8 (he's bringing all of
Elzie's living relatives), Hutch/2, Fullerton/2, Coburn/2, Jansson/5 (he's
bringing all of Mom Pinchbeck's living relatives), Rossell/2, and Carl
Hohl/2 (he thinks...not sure because he never was).
    Now, if there are ANY OTHERS, you have about 48 hours because I need to
order these things when I get back in town on the 5th.  So if any of you
reading this want some, give me an email.  Also think about recruiting
others not on my email list that you think might not yet know about all
these plans.
     WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO ROCK THE NEW STADIUM.  I've already
contacted officer Caffey and he's given us yet another reprieve to behave
any damned way we want to, complete with SMU Secuity protection.


Yours in -kai-

Subject: Enron Online Bid/Ask spread question

Hello Jeff, 

I submitted a  question that didn't get answered at the meeting.  I was 
hoping you could respond.  

We routinely see citizens of a country hold an "inferior" currency despite 
the presence of superior alternatives.  The incumbent currency has a smaller 
bid/ask spread, and a network externality  locks-in  the inferior currency.  
Volume creates lower spreads and lower spreads in turn attract more volume, 
conferring a monopoly status on the incumbent currency.

Do you think that Enron Online is taking advantage of a similar network 
externality?  How do our bid/ask spreads compare to the alternatives 
available to our competitors?  Do we stand willing to match our competitors 
bid/offer?

A final note:  I was curious to learn what you did to become so successful.  
Is there a place where your biography or resume is posted?  

Thanks in advance,

David Porter.

Good morning, Kristin.  Your Dad would like to meet you today at Maggiano's 
(located at 2019 S. Post Oak Blvd., 713.961.2700).  I'll make a reservation 
for 12:00 noon - he'll be there then, and I know you'll probably be a few 
minutes later than that.  Let me know if you want another plan.  SRSHi, Kristin.  I guess we got our wires crossed last Friday about lunch.  
Sorry about that.  He told me that you guys have rescheduled for tomorrow 
(Tuesday) at 12:30 p.m. and that you will meet him there.  I'll make a 
reservation at Carrabas on Kirby in your Dad's name at that time.  Please let 
me know if you have a conflict.  Thanks, SRS

PS - I also have you down for lunch with your Dad on Friday, November 10 - do 
you have it down, too?I found this.  Please disregard previous note.

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Thank you all for participating on the associate and analyst PRC committee.  
I believe that the PRC process is the most important tool we have to evaluate 
Enron's talent, and your role in the process is critical.  With the all 
important year-end PRC quickly approaching, I'd like to spend a little time 
with you sharing not only my philosophy on the process, but also talking 
about the mechanics of the process.  There will also be time to answer any 
questions you may have.

To that end, please join me and Charlene Jackson for breakfast on Thursday, 
November 30, at 8:30 a.m. in EB50M.  If you are unable to attend in person 
and would like to participate by conference call, that can be arranged.  
Please RSVP your attendance to Cheryl Kuehl at x3-9804.

I look forward to seeing you on November 30, and again, many thanks for 
spending your time on this critical process.

JeffKathy, Mr. Jeff Skilling has an Enron meeting on November 30 that will 
prevent his participation in the Houston Mentor Network Breakfast.

ventures in the US and Asia for many years.  Of late, he has been running

I'm writing on behalf of Mr. Jeff Skilling in response to your e-mail below.  

Mr. Skilling is very interested in meeting with Sr. Rafael Miranda.  
Unfortunately, he does not have any planned trips to Europe within the next 
couple of months, though that may change after the first of the year.  If, 
however, Sr. Miranda has any plans to be stateside, I would be happy to 
arrange a time for the two of them to meet.

evening and hopes to see you there to discuss Genesis Park and Vitol.  In the 
event you two do not cross paths there, please let me know and we'll see what 
we can do to schedule a meeting before the end of the year.

Subject: Genesis Park


Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a "new economy" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our "offices" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17 acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Dear Ms. Siska,

On behalf of Mr. Jeff Skilling, I am responding to a request from Mr. Warren 
Staley to forward to you the name of Enron's contact with regard to an 
information exchange on leadership development between Enron and Cargill.  
Mr. Skilling suggests that you call Mr. Steve Kean, EVP and Chief of Staff.  
Mr. Kean can be reached at 713.853.1586 or via e-mail at 
steven.kean@enron.com.

If I may be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Apologies for the delay in responding to your e-mail below.

Jeff has given your proposal serious consideration.  However, given the 
current demands on his time, he has decided to decline your offer to join the 
Cogent Communications Advisory Committee.

On behalf of Jeff, many thanks for the opportunity and best wishes for 
success.

Subject: Cogent Communications


Dear Jeff,

Hope you are doing well.  It has been quite a long time since we last spoke
when I was with Pathnet.  I have since started another company called Cogent
Communications and the company has been progressing very well in the last
year.

I'm in the process of putting together an Advisory Committee for the company
composed of industry, business, and political leaders.  I think your depth
of experience in telecom could add a lot of value to the company and am
looking to gauge your interest level in joining the committee.  The
commitment is limited to one meeting per year and you would receive stock in
the company.  Thus far we have commitments from Sergio Zyman of Coca Cola
and are in discussions with Bob Dole and Vernon Jordan.

Cogent is a facilities-based ISP offering very high bandwidth Internet
access to business users in the top tier cities in the US.  Utilizing the
latest in fiber-optic technology, we've built an all optical nationwide
network and are offering 100mbps non-oversubscribed service for a flat rate
of $1,000 per month.  Feel free to take a look at our website at
www.cogentco.com.  The company has raised over $350MM in financing to date
with investors including Oak Investment Partners, Broadview Capital, Texas
Pacific Group, Capital Research, and Worldview Technology Partners.

Please give me a call/email at your earliest convenience.  I look forward to
speaking with you and catching up.

Sincerely,

Dave Schaeffer, CEO
202-295-4201

Paul and me:

Subject: Additional PRC Reps and Attending the PRC


We have received numerous requests from individuals in the business units who 
either want to add someone to the PRC Committee or who want to have someone 
attend the Associate and/or Analyst PRC meetings because they do not have a 
representative on the Committees.  

Unfortunately, it is not possible to add additional PRC Reps at this time 
because all of the Associates and Analysts have been divided between the 
existing PRC Reps.  Additionally, as you are aware, the PRC meetings are next 
week, December 12th & 13th and there is not enough time to gather 
information.  We will, however, be reducing the number of Associates and 
Analysts that each PRC Rep is representing and will need several additional 
Reps. If you have individuals that should be nominated please send the names 
to Terry Bosien.  The parameters that were used for the initial appointments 
were as follows:

The person must be a well-respected individual who is nominated/approved by 
the Office of the Chair of the Operating Company
The Associate PRC Reps are vice presidents
The Analyst PRC Reps are directors /sr. directors

The level of the PRC reps on the committee is important to adhere to for 
several reasons.  First, Jeff wanted individuals at these levels to gain 
additional exposure in the organization and be involved in activities beyond 
their business unit boundaries.  Additionally, it potentially places the PRC 
Rep in an awkward position and they may feel undue pressure in the meeting if 
they are required to disagree with a more senior individual.  

We have also received request from individuals wanting to "observe" the 
meeting.  As in the MD/VP process, individuals are not allowed to just 
observe if they are not a part of the Committee.  We attempted to have the 
major units represented, however, it is not possible to have every division 
represented.   Jeff Skilling spent over an hour with the PRC Reps explaining 
why the individuals selected as PRC Reps, rather than the Associates' & 
Analysts' managers, should be the ones to represent the Associates & Analysts 
in the PRC.  He also reiterated the importance of the PRC Reps' 
responsibilities which was to (1) meet with the Associates' and Analysts' 
managers;  (2) gather as much information as possible and (3) advocate 
objectively for the individual.
Also, if there are too many individuals in the room it is difficult or 
impossible to come to a consensus, which has been the case in the past.  

I hope this is helpful.  If business units find this is not acceptable, they 
should seek approval for their attendance from Jeff Skilling.

Thanks for your understanding, cooperation and support.

Charlene

Jeff,

I spoke with Mark Palmer concerning the interview with Businessweek magazine, 
January 2nd.  He has asked me to participate in the article to discuss Enron 
Media Services and thought it would be a good idea for me  to give you a 
quick update in the event the reporter questions you about the business.  Let 
me know if you would like for me to stop by or call you to bring you up to 
date.   I will be out on vacation December 20th returning January 2nd.

Congratulations on your appointment to CEO.

Subject: Non-solicitation Agreement ---Enron Corp. and Scient Corporation

The purpose of this email is to obtain the necessary approvals from each of 
you per the policy dated October 27, 1999 concerning entering into agreements 
containing non-solicitation provisions.

Jay Fitzgerald has been negotiating and is about to finalize a services 
agreement with Scient Corporation (Scient will be providing software and 
hardware related services).  It contains a mutual agreement not to solicit 
the other's employees for a one year period.   Jay thinks the major 
beneficiary of that provision will be us, since it is more likely that they 
will want some of our employees rather than the other way around.

Please indicate your approval by reply to this email.  Thank you.




Mr. Stuart, 

Mr. Skilling has reviewed your communications and has determined that Enron 
is not interested in pursuing at this time.  Thank you for the opportunity.

Regards,
Sherri Reinartz-Sera

Subject: Follow-up re: e-rehab



Just a quick update and follow up to my previous e-mail.

My colleague, Cory Christensen (another McKinsey alum), and I met with IBM
regarding a potential strategic relationship. That meeting went far better
than expected. A similar document to the one I sent to you has now reached a
number of their senior executives. Tom Bouchard, SVP of Human Resources, for
example, reacted by saying, "They're (e-rehab) addressing a huge problem. I
would love to talk to them." one of their senior healthcare VPs stated,
"This is exactly the kind of thing IBM would like to do. This is not the
only big thing we're looking at, but this is definitely big. It's right on!"
The table has turned. IBM is now pushing us with information requests and to
move the process along.

We told IBM that e-rehab is most interested in them as a customer, as is the
case with Enron and another half dozen blue-chip companies with which we
have initiated a dialogue. However, because IBM has come to recognize the
relevance and potential value we can deliver, they are now keenly interested
in becoming a minority investor (assuming that we clear their due diligence
screens).

The meeting with IBM last Friday was in Stamford Connecticut so I arranged a
meeting just prior to that with Steve Denning in Greenwich. Our visit was
meant to be purely social, but Steve reacted quite positively to our
business and would be interested in considering an investment by General
Atlantic Partners (GAP) if we sign up an IBM ... or one or more companies of
similar stature, such as Enron. Aside from GAP and our current investors, we
are not considering traditional funding sources. GAP is an exception because
of their potential non-monetary value-added.

In any case, the purpose of this note is to solicit a reaction to my earlier
e-mail. In other words, would Enron have an interest as a potential (early
adopter) customer and/or strategic investor? I would not have approached you
in the first place unless I was convinced that our services would be of
great benefit to Enron. If you have an interest in exploring this
opportunity, I'd like to determine and schedule next steps. I apologize. I
don't mean to be pushy, but I'm anxious and feel a great deal of urgency.

I'll place a call to your office next week to get a read on your
temperature. Look forward to getting a response.

Regards,

Lance Stuart

Subject: Harvard Update

Leonel Azuela (Harvard) verbally DECLINED our offer to become an Associate at 
Enron.  He will accept a position with McKinzie in Houston.  He said he 
really appreciated the calls and the follow up especially from Jeff Skilling 
and he wants to keep in touch since he will be in Houston.  Leonel said that 
due to his financial situation, he really had no choice but to accept the 
McKinzie offer at this time.  Other than that, he admires and respects Enron 
and thought we did a top notch job with our follow up. He really envied the 
opportunities we had to offer.  It was truly a monetary issue.

BUT... It's not over, we still have 4 outstanding offers for HBS that expire 
on February 15th.  Please call the candidates and offer your assistance in 
answering any questions about the organization or Houston in general that may 
help them with their decision.  

The candidates are:      
     David Frost   617-562-1872
     Scott Landry   617-661-8499
     Amy VanBuskirk 617-868-1816
     Antonio Vivanco  617-868-9008 

I spoke to everyone last week and I know that a few want more time.  For 
example, some candidates are doing very targeted searches that are outside of 
the campus recruiting process.  Unfortunately, we cannot extend our 
deadline.  I honestly think we have a chance with these candidates.  It is 
important to emphasize the opportunities at Enron because most of them have 
other offers that exceed our package, but if they look at the BIGGER PACKAGE, 
we are very much a contender.  It's our job to sell them on that long term 
opportunity and to look beyond the short term.

Thanks for your help.

Hi, Suzanne.

I was wondering if you would do me a favor.  You have sent a couple of 
packages to Jeff's home by UPS or FedEx.  Unfortunately, Jeff is never there 
to sign for them, so the packages are delayed in getting to him as we have to 
track them down.  UPS is very good about rerouting to the business address, 
but FedEx won't reroute without the permission of the sender (i.e., you).  

At any rate, in the future if you would send packages to Jeff at Enron Corp., 
1400 Smith Street, EB5008, Houston, Texas, 77002, I would really appreciate 
it.  And of course, anything marked "confidential" is opened only by him.

Thanks a lot, Suzanne.  Hope all is well with you.

SherriAmelia, just wanted to make sure that you had Jeff signed up...I'm sure you 
probably do!  SRSMichael, I'm responding on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who is traveling abroad.

It appears that this is informational only for Jeff, and you are not inviting 
him to attend the meetings.  If this is an invitation to attend, he is unable 
to as he will still be traveling abroad.

I have made some arrangements in scheduling potential investment bankers to 
talk with us about our current project.  I have informed them about our 
current situation and thinking, and they will be prepared to present their 
ideas on deal process, potential investors/buyers, valuation, fee proposal, 
credentials etc.  I plan to make a decision very quickly regarding whom we 
will work with, and get the process moving as quickly as possible.

We will meet with Merrill Lynch on Monday February 28 (a time has not yet 
been designated)
Schroder's will be in our offices on Wednesday March 1, 2000 at 9:30 am
I am still trying to schedule a date and time with Nicholas Wrigley and

and the Schroder's meeting on Wednesday.  Thanks.

Mr. Collins, 

Mr. Skilling is considering this invitation and has requested a bit more 
information.  What time are the awards presentations taking place on April 
11?  Mr. Skilling does have an appointment in New York at 8:00 a.m. on April

I'm not sure it will work.  Please advise at your earliest convenience.

Subject: RISK AWARDS PRESENTATION





I am sure you are aware that as part of  first ever Risk Awards - published 
in January - Enron Corporation achieved the  accolade: Energy/commodity 
derivatives house of the  year.

This award was won, not simply  because of your lead in energy and power in 
the US, but because of the lead  Enron has taken in new areas of risk 
management.

We very much hope you can join us to be presented  with the Award at the Risk 
2000 Europe Congress in Paris on April 11th - we  invite you to attend the 
conference as a full delegate and I am sure there are a  number of sessions 
which will be of interest to you. A formal invitation will  follow from our 
editor.

We also intend to publish a special  supplement that will provide Awards 
winners with an excellent opportunity to  celebrate their achievements 
through advertising.

This supplement will be distributed with the  March issue of Risk and to all 
delegates attending the Risk 2000  Congress.




For more details on the  Risk 2000 congress please click this link: 
http://www.riskpublications.com/risk2000euro/index.htm
 

I hope that my email is clear and I will  contact you shortly to find-out 
your reactions to our proposal - however if you  have any questions 
beforehand - please feel free to contact  me.

Kind regards,

Subject: Home-Link Business Model


Hi Jeff,
Don't know if you remember me from your old McKinsey days, but I am Richard
Saettone's wife. The entire family is finally back in Houston after several
years in Peru.  I am working for a company called Home-Link Services, and
wanted to request your aid in finding the correct person to talk to at Enron
regarding our business model.

We currently represent over 200,000 transactions per year (people moving),
and one of the most requested services from our customers is the connection
of utilities.  As an aggregator for the energy sector with that type of
volume, who do you recommend we call?  We are expected to grow to about
500,000 transactions by year-end.

Feel free to call me with any questions.  I would be most happy to send you
or the proper Enron contact an executive summary for review.

Richard sends his regards and we hope your family is doing well.

Subject: MS150 and Associate/Analyst Picture for Encounter

Mr. Skilling,

Hello, my name is Samuel Pak and I am an Analyst in the A/A program.  There 
will be approx. 15-20 of us from the A/A program participating in the MS 150 
with you.  As a result, the Encounter has asked me to cover this event for 
our up coming next issue.  As with any great story, we need a picture!  So 
therefore, I would like to request a moment of your time after we take our 
Enron Dream Team photo prior to the start of the ride.  I have spoke with 
Amelia Alder and Deborah Gebhardt, and they are willing to accommodate us 
after the group photo.  So how about a photo?

Look forward to meeting you.  Good luck!  I know I will need it.

Regards,

Subject: Employee Communications with OOC

Ken/Jeff/Joe:

 As you may know, I have recently been hired to direct the new Office of 
Labor and Employment Relations (formerly Fair Employment and Labor 
Practices).  One of the many major roles of my group is to conduct 
investigations into employee allegations of discrimination, harassment, and 
other unfair treatment. One recent investigation involved an employee who was 
communicating via e-mail with your office on a constant and unyielding 
basis.  As experience shows, this is not an uncommon occurrence as some 
employees feel that they must go to the top to get attention.

 As you have been doing, please direct all such employee communications to me 
for prompt processing.  This will enable you to avoid being subjected to 
depositions and trial testimony in any subsequent legal proceeding as a fact 
witness.  Naturally, I will keep you informed as to the results of the 
investigation to any extent that you desire.

 Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

Jeff,

Sam Malone would love for you to join him live at the Morning Show broadcast 
from the Enron Building on April 7.  The optimal time to speak with Sam is 
between 7 and 8 am, but not at the top or bottom of the hour .  He wants the 
opportunity to banter with you on air about why Enron is the best place to 
work, Enron Field and what you have been doing lately.   It will be very 
informal, and depending on your schedule, he welcomes you to stay as long as 
you can.

Please let me know when you are available.

Subject: Re: earthquake---are you all right?



Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probably
only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.

Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in the
streets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up on
solid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad construction
here; stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half a
block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparent
injuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not so
lucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed had
a genertor and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying, men
reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in the
middle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks in
neighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much I
learned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, which
is depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.

A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs up and about;
mistook that comotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much like
after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in my
subconscious.

Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  May
need it.

Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll send
this to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok and
worried about them worrying about me.

Love,

Mark

Heidecker claimed that he was fired from Enron because of an alleged

allegation.  However, Mr. Heidecker continued to attempt communications with 
Joe.  I felt that it was prudent  to alert OOC by the message below not to

Subject: CERA's Mexico Energy in Transition Summit




Mr. Jeffrey K. Skilling 
President and COO 
Enron Corporation 

Dear Mr. Skilling: 

Building on the success of our special event held this past August in 
Houston, Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) has created a new 
service, the "Mexico Energy Advisory Service". Designed to help facilitate 
the dialogue between the energy community and key government decision-makers, 
this service creates an open environment for members to exchange ideas with 
the country's energy policy makers regarding the future of the Mexican energy 
sector and the role of private investment.

To launch this new service, we will be hosting the inaugural Mexico Energy 
Summit on January 17, 2001 in Mexico City at the JW Marriott Hotel. This 
event will bring together senior executives from the energy community as well 
as key members of the new Mexican government in interactive sessions aimed at 
facilitating dialogue between the public and private sectors.

We invite you to consider participating in this first Summit, and becoming a 
member of the service. To view the agenda for the first Summit meeting, as 
well as a description of the scope, benefits, and deliverables of the 
service, please visit our website at: 
http://www20.cera.com/event/details/0,1324,CID1287,00.html 

The goal of the Mexico Energy Advisory Service is to help bridge the 
information gap that now exists in Mexico's energy sector. Through our 
interactions with the private sector, the state owned energy companies, the 
new administration, the Congress, and other interested parties, CERA will 
formulate objective and independent market analysis, and will monitor the 
progress and pitfalls of the energy reform process in Mexico.

To view the complete details of the service, please visit our website at: 
http://www20.cera.com/offerings/details/0,1504,CID1286,00.html 

To participate in the Summit, please complete and return the enrollment form 
found on our website. Please note that a portion of the Summit fee may be 
applied toward your first year's membership in the service. Should you have 
any questions about the Mexico Energy Advisory Service or the Summit meeting, 
please contact me or my colleague Lauren Laidlaw.? I can be reached directly 
at +1 617 498-9191 or e-mail to abullrich@cera.com.? Ms. Laidlaw can be 
reached at +1 617 441-2604 or e-mail to llaidlaw@cera.com.

A few months ago we talked about me working for Enron.  I am a long time

Though we did not find a position for me in your company things have gone
quite well.  I now have opened an office for Angus Systems Group in Atlanta.


Jeff...your company does a lot of facility stuff and our company is the
expert in web based applications for properties for work requests and
preventive maintenance.  Could you give me the name of the person in your
company that I could show our applications to?

Here is a little about our company and a brochure on a web, wireless and

Dear Hilary,

The items Mr. Skilling purchased have arrived in Houston and I'm working with 
a customs broker to get them out of KLM Cargo.  The broker has indicated that 
the packing list and tax invoice are not descriptive enough to get the items 
out of customs, so I need to provide them with a detailed list of items, what 
they are made of and what he paid for them.  Unfortunately, Mr. Skilling is 
out of the country until January 2, 2001, and KLM will only hold these items 
until December 23 when they send them to some government warehouse.  If you 
could e-mail or fax me this information asap it is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance.

Curly, I was copied on Ronnie Chan's note to you re: ICBC.  What are we 
working on with them?  Please advise.

JeffGail, 

I look forward to introducing you to the Enron management team.  Please 
advise when you will next be in Houston.

JeffRon, 

Your e-mail was such a pleasant surprise!  Thanks so much for the kind words.

I would love to get together for lunch in the near future, though January is 
typically a tough month for me.  I'll have my assistant, Sherri Sera, call 
your office to see what we can arrange.

Thanks again for the note.  I look forward to seeing you soon.

JeffWilson, Sorry for the delay in responding to this e-mail - yesterday was 
Jeff's first day back in the since December 14, so we are catching up!

Jeff asked me to let you know that he is very supportive of this opportunity, 
and has conveyed that to Mr. Lay.  I'm not sure what next steps would be, but 
please feel free to call on us should you need our assistance further.

Subject: NewPower & Enron

Mr. Skilling,
First, let me congratulate you on being appointed to CEO of Enron. Very 
exciting news!

Mr. Lay may have spoken to you about NewPowers' desire to be the premier 
energy provider to Enron employees.
- If you had a moment, please take the time to read and reflect on the 
opportunity of this project.
- As you will notice, I was assigned to lead the project and am looking 
forward to working with Enron (again).

I look forward to  the opportunity of seeing you again, while I am in Texas; 
and I hope that you will find it worth your while to provide input to this 
project.
Having a good understanding of Enron and it's culture, I strongly believe 
that your direct support will have a huge effect on the success of the 
project.

Below is the Email that Mr. Lockhart sent to Mr. Lay:

As part of NewPower's plan to enter Texas, we would appreciate your support 
to implement a plan to offer Enron Employees the opportunity to sign up to 
NewPower when deregulation opens on February 15th.  We believe that an Enron 
Employee Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity and customized offers to 
employees at Enron's partners could be a cost effective way for NewPower to 
help achieve our goal to be the branded choice of electricity in Texas  

We have developed some compelling "Consumer Driven" sign up incentives for 
Enron Employees such as "Guaranteed Savings - Free December" electricity, a 
aligned to a $20.00 NewPower ATM card and free companion airline ticket 
coupons. 
 
We would appreciate your help and support on the following:

Obtaining Enron Executive support/guidance for our proposed Enron Employee 
Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity. 
 - It would be helpful to have your personal endorsement linked to 
implementation assistance through Cindy Olson's HR group.
Guidance and support for a similar "Customized" offer to Enron's partners 
employees that might include Vincent & Elkins, Compaq, Arthur Andersen, 
Continental, University of Houston, University of Houston American Airlines.
   - We would appreciate any thoughts on other companies we should approach.
          - It would be helpful if you would consider sending  a letter or 
email of introduction to the companies CEO and head of Human Resources in the 
near future.
                  
To help you understand more about the proposed plan, attached, please find a 
copy of the plan highlights and draft creative that was sent by Nick Utton 
(Chief Marketing Officer) to Cindy Olson.  Nick is currently in discussions 
with Cindy on how to best implement this plan and has assigned Wilson Kriegel 
as the NewPower manager responsible for working through the details.  


I look forward to your input and help.  
This could go a long way in Texas towards our goal of NewPower being the 
national brand of "Energy Solutions".

Wilson Kriegel


Shack, 

Thanks for the nice note.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but I 
took a couple of weeks off for the holidays  immediately following the 
announcement.

The reunion was really great, and I'm sorry too that we missed each other.  
Next time you get to Houston, please give me a call (713.853.6894).  It would 
be great to get together and catch up.

Hope you had a great holiday and Happy New Year!

Subject: CEO - congrats


Rocky,
I saw the announcement of your promotion in the Austin paper a couple days ago
and wanted to send my congratulations.   I recall our freshman year, you wrote
your chemistry paper on energy, I wrote mine on semiconductors.  Little did we
know our initial interests as 18 year olds would become our careers.

Arends says he sees you regularly when you hold your financial reviews.  I
wasn't able to make it to his wedding.  Did you? If so, how was it?

Sorry we weren't able to connect at the reunion in October, I really hoped 
we'd
have a chance to catch up on what's happened since we last talked (maybe 15
years ago?).    Hope you aren't overwhelmed with the Beta egroups email 
banter.
It's been fun reacquainting with the brothers.  I'm getting together with Bill
Jordan next month in California on one of my trips.  I know you're busy, but 
if
you have a second, drop a reply.

I'm proud of your career accomplishments and our shared history and 
friendship.
Good work, worm.
Have a great holiday.
-kai-

Mark,  

Jeff is considering taking Jeffrey on an African safari July 4-13, and was 
wondering if you would have any interest in joining them.  He is in the 
process of gathering information now and has not yet committed, but wanted to 
guage your interest.  He's looking primarily at the Ngorongoro conservation 
area and the Serengeti.  I can forward a proposed itinerary to you once 
received from the guides.

Please let us know if you're at all interested.

Thanks, SherriDear Suzanne,

I'm sorry for the delay in returning your e-mail.  We're catching up now 
after taking some time off over the holidays.

Unfortunately, due to Jeff's travel schedule, a meeting in January or even 
early February is not feasible.  I would be happy to schedule a meeting in 
late February or early March if that timing works for you.  Please call me 
should you wish to proceed on that basis.

Thank you and regards,

Subject: Congratulations/January Meeting


Dear Jeff,

Congratulations on being named Enron's new Chief Executive Officer.  What an
outstanding and well-deserved accomplishment.

Cary Maguire and Dean Niemi would like to make a trip to Houston in January
to visit with you if your schedule permits.  Cary is particularly interested
in touring the trading floor.  Would you please let me know if you would be
willing to meet with them and, if so, when the best time would be?  Thank
you.

Also, Liz Williams, SMU's Treasurer, met with Bart Schachter of Blueprint
several weeks ago.  She said his fund looks like a good opportunity.  She
shared with me that even though SMU is currently over its allocation to
venture and private equity and has therefore slowed down on new commitments,
the University's investment advisor is evaluating Blueprint.  She also told
me that decisions on venture and private equity can often take quite awhile.
I will keep you posted on any further developments that I learn.

Warm regards,

Suzanne

Subject: Drive Increased Profits with Vignette's eBusiness Platform


Enron Corp
Jeffrey Skilling


Dear Jeffrey,

I'm writing in regards to your online strategy and in particular how you plan 
to build and scale your emerging online business and relationships.  
E-Business Relationships can mean a lot of things.  At it's core, it is 
understanding the needs of your customers, partners, and employees 
(collectively, your Business Community), and getting the right content to the 
right person to generate the greatest impact in the most timely and effective 
manner possible.

Strong e-Relationships increase retention rates, conversion rates and drive 
long term loyalty.  The idea is to make the internet your Business 
Communities' preferred channel for completing a transaction that is being 
offered, whether that is completing a support call, buying a product, 
registering for an event or service, enabling partner success, managing an 
account, training, or just acquiring information.

As Enron Corp looks ahead, it is important to continue to better understand 
who your Business Community are and in turn build online relationships with 
them.  Studies have shown that companies spend five times more on attracting 
new customers than on retaining the customers they have.  Attracting new 
employees can cost 10 times more than retaining existing employees, and in 
the energy business your reputation with your partners is critical to your 
success.

Vignette is the undisputed leader in Value Chain and eRelationship Management 
with the most robust platform, applications and services offerings in the 
industry.  With over 1200 customers, Vignette is helping our customers 
create, manage and automate their online relationships.  The Vignette 
Platform enables our customers to manage and automate the flow of information 
from their back office to their front office, from their suppliers to their 
customers, partners, and employees and all the way through eMarketplaces and 
exchanges.

Some examples of value we deliver to our customers include:

- Portals - Reliant Energy, Shell Oil, Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), 
Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA), Fidelity, Merrill Lynch, C/Net, 
ICQ, Industry Standard, iWon, United Airlines
- Knowledge Management - Encyclopedia Britannica, AMA, NotHarvard, Click2Learn
- Customer Self-service - 3Com, On Semiconductor, Bank One, Compaq, First 
Union
- eCommerce - FuelQuest, DownStream Energy, Land's End, Ingram Micro, 
Travelocity
- Partner Enablement - National Semiconductor, Compaq, AMD, NASD, Deutsche 
Telecom
- Online Learning - Epic Learning, Family Education Center, NotHarvard
- Syndicated Business Network - National Semiconductor
- Data Mining & Analysis- Amazon, Seagate
- Back Office Integration & Partner Exchanges- ExxonMobil, Grainger, 
AltaVista, Honda, Coca-Cola

I have included a case study done on Royal Dutch Shell that I think you will 
find informative as well as relevant to your business.  Over the next few 
weeks, you will receive a more detailed information packet from Vignette.

Subject: INVESTIGATION OF CORRUPTION IN THE TURKISH ENERGY SECTOR - PRIVATE=
 &=20
CONFIDENTIAL


=09


Eric Shaw's team has learned that an investigation has been initiated by th=
e=20
Turkish military to expose and eliminate corruption in the Turkish energy=
=20
sector.

On January 6, the military took seven energy sector bureaucrats into custod=
y.=20
In the following days, other officials from TEA? (the electricity generatio=
n=20
monopoly) and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) and=20
executives from a number of Turkish companies were also taken into custody.=
=20

While many of the bureaucrats and executives have been released, a leaked=
=20
report from the military investigators suggests that the operation is wide=
=20
ranging and may ultimately target the Minister of Energy and Natural=20
Resources and other senior energy sector bureaucrats and businessmen.=20

Enron Implications

Trakya - One Turkish newspaper has reported that Enron=01,s  478 MW Trakya =
power=20
project was being investigated.  This has not been reported anywhere else. =
=20
Because the power price at Trakya has been the target of criticism in the=
=20
past, we are not surprised by this report. Although an investigation is=20
always a possibility, other than the one newspaper report, there has been n=
o=20
indication, official or otherwise, that an investigation is planned or=20
underway.
=20
GAMA - It has also been reported that the wife of Gorkhan Yardim, the Gener=
al=20
Manager of BOTA? (the natural gas monopoly), works at GAMA, our Turkish=20
partner in the Trakya project, and that his expensive car was a gift from=
=20
GAMA. GAMA has told us, and Yardim has defended himself publicly by saying,=
=20
that his wife has been working at GAMA since 1993, long before Yardim had=
=20
risen to his current position of power at BOTA?, and that the car was not a=
=20
gift from GAMA. It is worth noting, however, that there have been a number =
of=20
newspaper reports questioning GAMA=01,s role in a controversial gas marketi=
ng=20
deal being undertaken by their TurRusGas joint venture with Gazprom and BOT=
A?.

Outlook

It is still not clear how or when this investigation will end. In the mediu=
m=20
and long term, this will be good news for Enron and other reputable Turkish=
=20
or foreign companies which have found it difficult to do transparent energy=
=20
deals in Turkey in the past. In the short term, however, it is likely to=20
result in a marked decrease in meaningful activity in the Turkish energy=20
sector, as worried bureaucrats, innocent and guilty, lay low.=20

We will continue to monitor developments, especially with regard to the=20
Trakya project, and report as necessary.



Dear Mr. Kester,  

We are in receipt of your letter dated January 26, 2001, regarding a

Subject: UK CEOs

Jeff,

As you may recall from our discussion on your visit to London last summer, 
one of the challenges we have in Europe is raising the external profile of 
Enron.  To help address this, I recently replaced Ralph in a group of UK CEOs 
which meet monthly, so I can continue to raise awareness of Enron's 
businesses and generally network.   At each lunch meeting which lasts around 
two hours, one of the CEOs makes an informal 20 minute speech on a current 
business subject of their choice and then a discussion follows.

The group has asked if you would like to chair the meeting in September 2001 
on a date of your choice.  At the end of this note there is a list of the 
current membership.  I have been to one meeting and only around a third 
attended.

Please let me know if you are able to commit time to this.  There is no 
problem if you decline.

Subject: corporate directorship




Greetings Jeff, 

I am contacting you to inquire as to your interest and availability for a 
potential corporate directorship. 

In particular, I'd like to speak to you for a moment about an potential 
directorship at a British company with annual revenue of $5.4 billion. It is 
the global leader in education publishing and also has considerable growing 
interests as a provider of financial information and other media. The board 
meets seven times a year - three times in London, three times in the US, and 
once elsewhere. I would be delighted to speak with you on this in further 
detail if it is of interest and send full information.

If this particular opportunity is outside your interests,? then I would like 
to take a moment to discuss what types of directorships you would prefer.

Please don't hesitate to contact me at 312-993-0754 or by e-mail. 

I appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to hearing from you 
soon.

Subject: RE: Jeff Skilling for TPG CEO Conference


Jeff, next October 23, 24, 25 in Laguna Niguel, Texas Pacific is hosting
their annual  portfolio company CEO conference (about 50 CEO;s in
attendance).  TPG ( a client of mine), you may know, is a premier private
equity investor--known best perhaps for Continental Airlines or if you ride
motorcycles Ducati,. $10billion in funds investment and good guys, you may
have met Jim Coulter, or David Bonderman or Bill Price, the senior
partners. They love to have you as their keynote speaker and I think it
would be worth your while.  Let me know if it works or whether I can
connect you up with them directly. I hope all is going well and
congratulations on your formal recognition as CEO.. Cheers Bill  P.S. Steve
Ballmer mentioned to me a couple of weeks ago that his meeting with you
last year was "one of the most influential he's had"

CEO Conference





Bill --

As we discussed by voicemail, it would be great if you could connect with
Jeff Skilling to see if he would be interested in speaking at the TPG CEO
conference on the topic of Growth. Kristina sent over to Dick a copy of our
growth pamphlet, which he may also wish to use at the conference.  Enron is
featured prominently in the pamphlet as a great example of a growth story.

By way of background for Jeff, TPG has combined funds of well over $10
billion under management including its most recent $4.5 billion fund.
Their investments are loosely split between telecom, high tech, Europe and
all other.  They also have partial interests in a number of specialty funds
including Newbridge (Asia and Latin American), Aqua (water-related
investments), Colony (real estate), Gryphon (early stage, growth) and a
number of others including newly created venture and crossover funds.
There will be over 50 CEOs at their conference, including Continental
Airlines, America West, Del Monte, Beringer, Ducati, Bally, and a host of
others.

I can't remember the exact date for the conference, but I think Dick
mentioned the fall time frame.

Please let me/Dick know if Jeff would be interested in speaking with Dick
further.

Patti,

It was good to see you and Mike last night. 

I wanted to follow up on the MS150 - I can assure you that you will do fine 
without training (assuming, of course, that you have a bike).  I did it that 
way twice before with no major complications.  Given your running, you will 
do better.  It really is a lot of fun.

Sherri is checking to see if you can join the Enron team.  We will be the 
first team off on Saturday morning and the team has good facilities (tents, 
food, etc.) that improve the experience.  GO FOR IT!!

Jeff

PS - hi, Patti - this is Sherri.  I did check with our team captain and she 
said you could join our team so long as you do so by Friday.  She is going to 
e-mail all the necessary forms and information to me, which I will forward to

Jeff,

Thanks for getting back to me.  You probably saved us quite a bit of time and 
money.  

It looks like half of the City of London has been duped into helping E.ON 
fool its shareholders.  I wonder how many of their other sales were actually 
auctions versus pre-arranged sales dressed up for the shareholders.

We will start our brainstorming sessions over again with a new rule - no 
Germans!

Thanks again,

Joe



Please see the attached memo from Jeff and Ken.
Dear David,

At Jeff's request, I'm writing to let you know that he does not wish to meet

Jeff,
I had called Sherrie to see if we could meet, together with my partner,
Jordan Larimore, now that we are both reaffiliated with Lehman.
The proposed meeting was not about Lehman's Private Venture offering per se,
but rather about reestablishing a broader Private Client relationship
between you and Lehman.
I look forward to hearing from you and wish you well on your trip.

Dera Mr. Skilling,

Just a short e-mail to invite you to a meeting that I will be having with
Carl Carter in your on-line development team at 1.00pm on the 27th floor in
your offices located at 1400 Smith.

Financial Market Solutions (FMS) is a leading financial software company
located in Bellevue, Washington. The company is dedicated to the development
and implementation of Internet-based trading solutions for institutions in
the global financial marketplace.  The central component of all FMS
solutions is the Universal Trading Platform (UTP), which is a dynamic
web-based platform that enables unlimited numbers of simultaneous users to
access the system and execute trades on a fully automated basis. This basic
premise distinguishes FMS from other solution providers and gives our
clients the ability to more effectively manage the liquidity of multiple
users, trading over the Internet on a single platform. The UTP has been
fully developed as a complete Foreign Exchange dealing system, however, the
same platform can be used for transactions in any tradable financial
instrument.

FMS has employed a team of expert software designers and technicians as well
as experienced professionals from the financial markets, who together have
designed and developed the UTP to transform the way the FX product is
delivered to end-users. The platform is equally suited to the needs of large
institutional users as well as retail investors. The FMS system, using the
latest technology, is the most advanced on-line trading system available
today and will likely shape the FX business model of the future.

We have made some majorprogress over the last 15 months and are poised to
announce some key relationships that will have a mojor impact in the FX
industry.

I understand that you are very busy, and that this invitation is unsolicited
but as they say nothing ventured nothing gained.



Kind Regards,

With regard to your second invitation to meet your business partner next

Jeff,

Two things:

Would you like to join Liz and me at the Contemporary Arts Museum Gala,
Friday, April 6th at 7.30, Bayou Club, Black Tie?

I would like to introduce you to my business partner, Clint Carlson in Aspen
next week.  He is going to attend the Goldman Sachs Natural Gas conference
March 18th - 21st .  Clint is the chief investment officer of our firm and
is the portfolio manager for our relative value arbitrage strategy (pairs
trading) which includes about $450mm in energy pairs.

Please let me know, Roy Trice, 214.932.9618.  

Dear Mr. Paul,

I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who asked me to let you know that he 
will send you a check in the amount of $200.  

While Jeff would probably be to modest to tell you himself, I thought you 
might be interested to know that he has been named the National MS Society's 
2000 Man of the Year, and will be honored at a dinner on September 30.  He 
has been a big supporter of the MS Society, primarily through his riding the 
MS150 from Houston to Austin since 1997.  This year's ride is April 15-16, 
and he has been busy collecting pledges - $20,000 so far, which will be 
matched by the Enron dollar-for-dollar.  Enron Corp. has the largest MS150 
team in the nation in terms of dollars raised, and this year our goal is 
$350,000.  It appears that our 378-person team has already blown through that 
goal and is well on its way to raising $400,000.  As MS has touched my 
family, I am very proud to be associated with a man and a company who so 
actively support research to find a cure.

I'm sure Jeff will write a personal note when he returns to town and sends 
his check.  In the meantime, good luck with your fund raising, and have a 
nice weekend.

To All Brother Beta's (and El!!),  3 weeks ago Woody Berry and I took a trip
to Rockford, Illinois to visit Phil Morrow, who has been struggling with MS
for the past 12 years.  The pictures tell the rest of the story.  I would
say that speaking for Woody that the trip was very bitter/sweet.  Bottom
line:  count your blessings, we never know what life has in store for us.

I will be hosting my Annual MS Walk/ Party in May.  I have done this for the
last 10 years.  I initially thought it would be a good thing for me to do as
I thought I had MS!!  Fortunately, my Neurologist thinks that I had a small
stroke back in '91 (never thought having a stroke would have been GOOD
news!!).

Now, I host the party in honor of Phil Morrow in hopes that we can find a
cure to help him.  As always, I collect donations from anyone and everyone
who is interested and/or able.  If you would like to send in a donation,
simply write out a check for whatever amount to:   NMSS (National Multiple
Sclerosis Society) and send it to:

Chuck Paul
6193 Forest Hills Dr.
Norcross,  Ga.  30092-4513

My email address is listed below.  If you have any other Beta's who you
think would like to see these pictures, please forward them on.

PS  First game at the new Ford Stadium on the SMU campus will be 9/2/00 at
6PM against KU.  Homecoming this year will be October 28th.  The new stadium
is looking GREAT!  I hope to be at both games but definitely at Homecoming.
Hope to see many of you there.  We will even have a 'tailgating' section
with 'adult beverages' allowed!!!

Subject: Hey Big Guys!

Oh Awesome Ones!  How grateful we are for your phenomenal fundraising efforts 
for Team Enron!  
Below is the rider number which you will wear in 2001, based on your 
fundraising performance in 2000.  

I will have your "special" rider packet at all our pickup points described in 
my earlier notice.  I am picking these up for you on March 20, and if you 
would prefer to pick it up yourself at one of the MS packet pickups, please 
let me know before Tuesday, March 20, at Noon.  I don't want to have it here 
at Enron if you're expecting to find it somewhere else!

Also, if you know for sure you will not participate this year, please let me 
know that ASAP! (713-646-6569) 

We will miss Wendy Gramm skating with us this year.  She has a date conflict 
but will return next year.  
Amy Moore is not riding this year, but is in charge of our refreshment tent 
in Austin!

Very impressive list, and thanks for all the hard work.  Team Enron has 50 of 
the top 200.

Subject: RE quote eCompany


Mr. Skilling,

I was compelled to contact you by the following information:
While reading eCompany Magazine March Issue, I came across the following
quote from Jeff Skilling CEO of Enron.

"Keeping the system up. You dread the chance the system will crash. We had
an air conditioning problem last April or May, and went down.
The next day the front page of Gas Daily Journal had a story that said "Gas
trading stops because Enron online is down.""

Netbotz offers early warning to just that type of failure and more.
http://www.netbotz.com

Mr. Skilling who would I contact at Enron to make them aware of a product
with a sub $1000. price tag to prevent those issues in the future?

Jeff:
In the March 2001 article of ecompany you recently made a statement about
what " Keep's
executives up at night?"  You were quoted:  "  Keeping the system up.  You
dread the chance
the system will crash.  We had an air-conditioning problem last April or
May, and we went down.
The next day the front page of Gas Daily Journal had a story that said, '
gas trading stops because
EnronOnline is down.'

I work with Availant, a software company in Cambridge, MA and our product,
Availant Manager, is
"self healing" technology.  It is proactive and autocorrective, designed to
monitor key system
resources and to take safe and effective action on an event before an outage
ever occurs. Recently,
Compaq decided to ship our software with every new Proliant server it
delivers to its customers.
It is brand-named Compaq Availability Agents.
http://www.availant.com/home.html

We believe our software could be of great value to Enron as the operation of
your online business is
so dependant on continuous server uptime.   If you would, please let me know
via email or phone the most
convenient way in which to schedule a meeting with the team who runs your
server operations.  I can be
reached directly at 617-374-7969.

Thanks,
Rob

Jeff,
 

I'd like to introduce you to?our company?and set-up a?one-hourconference 
call?and discussion with you?and/or?someone you?trustto evaluate?this 
opportunity.

iSpheres Corporationisco-founded by the Chairman of  Computer Science 
Department at California Institute of Technology.

iSpheres enables dynamic arbitrage opportunities in commodities  trading. 
With iSpheres, trading firms wrap applications like steel  marketplaces, 
energy marketplaces, demand planning systems, and production  planning 
systems as components, and derive additional business value by  monitoring 
these components for real time interdependent events and then  reacting to 
those?composite events  based on business rules.

iSpheres provides a software framework for developing and deploying these  
loosely-coupled Web Services or Meta-Applications. These applications are  
assembled from multiple components, each of which was previously itself an  
application and data source, to enable new business processes. 



For example, a $22 billion investment bank uses the iSpheres Meta  
Application Framework,?to  detect and react to interdependent market events. 
This enables them to optimize  and automate the acquisition and response to 
relevant dynamic?events in  their Market Intelligence information 
environment. 

The build out of the Internet and the rapid  deployment of eBusiness 
applications over last several years has established the  need and created 
the ability to build and deploy loosely-coupled Web Services or  Meta 
Applications.

Dear Dorothy:

Thank you very much for your note; below I have laid out the agenda for the
meeting for Ken and Jeff's approval:

1. Introduction to Adventis and our work in the Broad band space; - 20 minutes
2.  Ken's brief on Broad Band Services group's way forward: challenges,
issues, aspirations; - 15 minutes
3. Jeff's expectations and views form the corporate center;-10 minutes
4. Adventis' approach, likely routes to partnership;-10 minutes
5. Next steps: JEFF, KEN and our team.- 10/15 minutes

During the second hour with Ken, we wish to address specific points on the
out come of the first meeting to define areas of focus for path forward:

1 Strategic and operational issues for short term value creation, and
long-term robust development of BBS as global player
2. Acceleration capacity at BBS to capture short range opportunities versus
outside assistance.
3. Likely ways we could engage with Enron for both short term and long-term
wins.
4. Time line for creating the upside.

I am sure Ken and Jeff, will have a lot to add. Please do let me know.

Dorothy, given the significant challenges and opportunities ahead for Enron
BBS, we will have four of our senior most partners with deep insights into
Broad band and ASPs/CSPs join the meeting. I will come the night before, if
possible to have dinner with Jeff and/or Ken. Please do let me know the
possibility.

2. Acceleration capacity at BBS to capture short range opportunities versus
outside assistance.
3. Likely ways we could engage with Enron for both short term and long-term
wins.
4. Time line for creating the upside.

I am sure Ken and Jeff, will have a lot to add. Please do let me know.

Dorothy, given the significant challenges and opportunities ahead for Enron
BBS, we will have four of our senior most partners with deep insights into
Broad band and ASPs/CSPs join the meeting. I will come the night before, if
possible to have dinner with Jeff and/or Ken. Please do let me know the
possibility.

Subject: Broadband partnership with Walt Disney Corp

Jeff,

Have we explored the possibility of a broadband partnership with the Disney 
Corporation? I watched an interview the other night with Michael Eisner, and 
he said several times during the interview that Broadband held the future for 
delivery of Disney's entertainment products, but Disney is still waiting for 
the broadband infrastructure and bandwidth to be developed.

Subject: THREE WEEKS TO SHOWTIME !!

Here's some good riding for the weekend.  I've heard on the street that the 
Enron team is looking really good out there!  If you've picked up your rider 
packet from us and are sporting the new green and yellow official water 
bottle you'll stand out in the crowd.  They are not into general distribution 
yet.  If you don't have yours yet, come see us tomorrow.  (Reminder 
announcement to follow).

DON'T FORGET TO SPRING FORWARD SATURDAY NIGHT ONE HOUR INTO DAYLIGHT SAVINGS 
TIME!!

Sunday - April 1 - Tour d'Cypress - 7:15 AM - 53, 62, 85 miles
If you haven't yet registered for the Tour de Cypress, you can get more 
information at http://www.bicycletexas.com/houston.htm. 
$20 before January 31 , $25 after, $15 group or family of 4+. T-shirts and 
goodie bag guaranteed to all pre-registrants.
Ride Start:  Cypress High School
Highway 290 to Barker Cypress exit, go left after exit, and then turn right 
on Highway 529 which takes you to the high school. 
Questions:  Northwest Cyclery - 713-466-1240. 


Saturday, March 31 - 8:00 AM - 23 or 51 miles (NOTE PERMANENT LOCATION CHANGE)
This weekly ride now starts at Zube Park. From Telge and HWY 290, keep going 
north on 290 for 12 miles.  At the 11.5 mile mark you will see a Texaco 
Station to your right.  Keep going past the intersection by the Texaco 
station and turn right at your next opportunity (i.e. Roberts Road).  You 
will see an "Oakwood Homes" pre-fab housing lot on the corner of 290 and 
Roberts Road.  Turn right at Roberts
Road, and go about 8/10 of a mile to Zube park (on your right).
Park in the Northwest corner of the parking lot.

GROUPS OF 10-15 RIDERS ARE SENT OUT BASED ON RIDE SPEED, STARTING WITH THE 
FASTER RIDERS AND WORKING DOWN TO THE MORE LIESURLY PACED RIDERS.  THERE ARE 
SEVERAL ROUTES TO CHOSE FROM, 33, 48, 62 . . . ITS YOUR CHOICE. IF YOU ARE 
NEW TO OUR RIDE, PLEASE PICK UP A MAP. MAPS ARE PROVIDED AT EVERY RIDE.

THE NEW RIDER GROUP IS GEARED FOR NEW RIDERS. THE RIDE COORDINATOR WILL TAKE 
THE GROUP OUT ON A ROUTE DETERMINED AT THE START OF THE RIDE. NO RIDER GETS 
LEFT BEHIND IN THIS GROUP. THIS IS A GREAT GROUP TO RIDE WITH IF YOU ARE NEW 
TO CYCLING.  Questions:  Northwest Cyclery at 713-466-1240

Saturday - March 31 - Columbus - 8:00 AM - 56 miles - (hilly)
Here is the Conoco series, sponsored by Steve Moskowitz - This is ride #12, 
and there are 14 in the series, at a cost of $20 total.  Questions:  Patrick 
Scales at Enron - 713-345-3673.

You read the note right - it says we're starting from COLUMBUS, Tx!

Sorry this note is a day late and still missing a key detail - the exact
starting location - but due to the Round Top/Warrenton Antique Fair (100,000
visitors/day), we felt we needed to modify our route this Saturday.  There
is a hilly 56 mile route which starts in Columbus and covers many of the
same challenging hills as the ride originally planned but stays away from
Round Top, Warrenton, and Fayetteville and the busy roads immediately around
these towns.

Weekly Ride - Columbus, TX, Sat, 3/31 - 8 am

This week, we'll still get our hill training in and will have the
opportunity to climb the same hill (Lone Oak) that we would have had to
climb on the New Ulm route.  This ride is a 56 mile loop starting in
Columbus, hitting Lone Oak and Frelsburg and picking up beautiful
Zimmerscheidt Road going the other direction.  The Rides Around Houston book
gives this ride a score of "9" for exercise potential so look for some
hills.

The ride will start at 8:00 am sharp.  Columbus is an hour from the Sam
Houston Tolway/I-10 intersection so please allow yourself time to arrive in
Columbus by 7:15 am.

Directions to the Start - Beason's Park
We have permission to use Beason's Park as the starting off point.  Someone
is using the pavilion from 2:00pm to 7:00pm, and I told Judy that most of us
would be gone by then and we didn't really need the pavilion.  Beason's Park
does have restrooms, however, I will not vouch for the condition.

Beason's park is on US 90 just east of Columbus.  The most direct way is to
take I-10 to exit 698 (US 90 exit) and take US 90 west.  The park is on the
left hand side of the road just before the bridge over the Colorado river.
For those of you (like us) coming from Magnolia/The Woodlands the best way
is to take FM 949 to I-10.  We stay on the feeder which becomes US 90 at
exit 698.

If you want to pick up food or go to the bathroom before the ride, stay on
I-10 until exit 696 (Hwy 71).  There are convenience stores and bathrooms at
this exit.  At this point you can either take Hwy 71 north to US 90 and turn
right (east) to get to the park (which will be on your right just after the
bridge) or get back on I-10 to exit 698.

NOTE - As we get out into the country, I highly recommend stopping at the
local stores for your sport drinks, water, and a quick rest stop.  Your
drinks will be colder this way, you will have a timely rest stop, and the
local business will look forward to our return.

Here's a few reminders for those of you who are new to the list or have a
short memory:

Starting Time - 8:00 am - SHARP!
There were a lot of riders pulling into Cat Springs at 7:55 last Saturday.
If you arrive in Columbus after 7:30 and aren't fast at bike prep and
signing in, you'll get left at the start this week.  PLEASE allow time to
get to Columbus between 7:15 and 7:30.  Even though we're not riding to
Warrenton, we want to be off the roads as early as possible.

Check-in Process
Every rider is expected to sign in to indicate that they have started the
ride and sign-out on their return.  We have no way of knowing that you are
on the road and may need assistance if you don't sign in.  PLEASE arrive
early enough to sign in and remember to sign out when you finish the ride.

If you have completed the online or paper waiver, your name will appear on
the alphabetical sign-in sheets.  They are split up into groups of 5-6
sheets to speed up the sign in process so look for the clip board with your
name.  If this is your first ride and you haven't signed up online, you need
to complete a paper waiver and fill in your name on the blank sign-in sheet.
If you completed a paper waiver last Saturday and your name is not listed on
the alpha list, it's because you didn't sign the waiver (3 of you), you
signed one but didn't provide any emergency information, or I just couldn't
read your handwriting (5 VERY sloppy waivers last week!).  PLEASE arrive
early enough to fill out a legible waiver or slow down a minute when filling
it out.

I hate to harp on these details but it is vital that everyone help out to
ensure that you have a safe and fun ride.

Thanks!

Jeff,

How's it going in the world of energy?  I enjoy reading about you and your
adventures. Sounds like you might be having a little fun as well.

Attached is a resume from an acquaintance of mine.  Nice guy and would be
credit to anyone's organization.  Thought you  might forward it to
personnel.

Don't forget you've got a lifetime warranty on the drywall in your house.
My compliments.  Call me if you have any problems.  Also I walked your new
building last week.  Quite impressive, especially what we're having to
build on a tight schedule.  Should really be nice.  If you'd like a
personal tour, let me know.  I'd love to put you in a hardhat and introduce
you to the team that's doing all the work.  Would make a great shot for my
in-house publication and maybe yours as well.

Miss seeing you at our Forum meetings.  WPO is not as much fun as YPO.
Enjoy it while you can!

Hi Stan:

It was good to meet you this morning. I've enjoyed working out with Joel;
he's a good "kid" and I can certainly relate to his Midwest roots and Iowa
State background. I grew up on a grain/livestock farm in Gladbrook, Iowa, a
town of under 1,000 people, and did my BS at Iowa State and MBA at Kansas
University.

I'm currently working as Director, Business Development at RedMeteor.com,
an
internet-based energy brokerage company. We compete against Altra Energy,
EnronOnline, InterContinentalExchange and HoustonStreet. We started with
$22
million in venture capital, but need an additional infusion of capital to
build out our business model. I think it's going to be difficult for us to
attract additional funding in this climate, so I'm interested in making a
move to another employer when I find the right fit.

As I mentioned this morning, I've been talking with Conoco recently (my
previous employer for 9 years) as well as Enron's Broadband Services group.
I'm looking for a Houston-based business development position that would
build on my eCommerce experience at RedMeteor or my oil & gas pipeline
operations background. I've also met with Reliant Energy recently although
I
understand they've suspended hiring in their trading/eCommerce groups due
to
the California crisis.

Any suggestions you would have would be appreciated. Thanks for your time.

Subject: Stanford/McKinsey survey invitation letter

Jeff and Sherri,

As Jeff and I descussed briefly on the Dallas trip, Enron is involved ina 
5-yr research relationship sponsored by Stanford, in conjunction with 
McKinsey entitled "GLOBE"--it's looking at how Global companies manage 
themselves, internal communication networks, etc.

Part of the yearly plan is to conduct an emplyee survey of approximately 100 
"global" employees. I've taken the survey myself--it takes less than 15 
minutes--it's very easy and doesn't require revealing anything sensitive we'd 
be concerned about. Clicking on the invitation letter will provide a direct 
link to the survey, so please feel free to review the survey itself, or even 
take it.

We can best benefit from the data gathered if we get a good return on our 
survey.  We're likely to have the best chance of a good return if the 
invitation letter to participate comes from Jeff.

Would you please read the attached letter? If you give it your consent and 
approval, we can arrange to have the survey sent from Jeff's mailbox.



Please let me know--thanks!!

--Christie.

Hi Christie !!
 
  Please send me the survey invitation letter.  Also, I will send you a copy 
of the random list of respondents for your review tonight.  As I mentioned to 
Gerry, the survey is already developed and hosted by the Stanford/McKinsey 
group; therefore, there is no additional development work required.  
Typically, I would use our in-house survey tool, confirmit, to build and 
deploy surveys.  This is a special case where the survey link is already in 
place.  My specific deliverable for you would include the list of 100 random 
individuals and a mechanism for the deployment.  The same manner in which 
Gerry and I received the survey can be used for the 100 random individuals.  
That is, simply mailing the survey link along with the invitation letter to 
each individual via Lotus Notes.  This is not a typical function of my area; 
however, I am glad to lend assistance in this case.  

In the future, should you require a survey built from "scratch" 
(so-to-speak), I will be able to assist you in that process.  Thank you for 
your patience.

Regards,

I can prepare the survey invitation letter.  Shall I send it to both of you?  
When do you think we can expect to be ready to send the survey?

Thanks to both of you!

My name is Tony Kishindo and I am the Senior Market Analyst for DeWolff

time on your calendar for an introductory meeting between yourself and my
Vice President, Scott Bein.

commitment or decision at this point. We realize you may not be considering
the services of an outside resource, now or in the foreseeable future. We
non-the-less would appreciate the privilege of meeting with you, determining
the compatibility of our two firms, and earning a place in your Rolodex.
Regardless of the outcome of this meeting, we sincerely appreciate your
kindness and courtesy.

We offer our clients guaranteed process improvement and operations cost
reduction. We guarantee a 20% - 30% increase in production in as little as 8
months. The reason the results are so quick is because we are not technology

blanket when it comes to process improvement. Please feel free to visit our

David, just heard that you joined the 2001 Enron MS150 team - 
congratulations!  Look forward to seeing you out at Tully Stadium on the 20th.

JeffMike, I received a voicemail from Matt Khourie tonight regarding the 
presenters.  Apparently, Jeff's recollection that Matt was to contact the 
presenters was inaccurate; Matt indicated that it had been agreed that you 
would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the 
SUN demonstration.  

With Jeff out of town until Monday, I would really like to have someone 
contact the presenters before the end of the week.  Is this going to be 
possible?  I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.  In the meantime, below are 
the links to the presenters' bios, which I believe include their phone 
numbers.  Let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them.  

Additionally, I spoke to Penny this morning regarding the number of RSVPs we 
have to date.  I'm very concerned about space and would like you guys to 
reconsider the buffet idea, with seating scattered around the facility, and 
the meeting room set up "class room" style.  If we go with the plated 
breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 "10-tops," there will be no 
space for a screen, podium, AV equipment, etc.  If we have more than 120 
people (I think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing 
to come in), we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting 
room.  In talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the 
YPO group, I've been told that many YPOers do not show for the breakfast and 
will walk in just in time for the presentations.  I think you guys and Jeff 
are scheduled to meet next Tuesday, so perhaps that can be discussed then.

I'll give you a call tomorrow, Mike.  Thanks, SRS

Please find attached an invitation to our upcoming roundtable, "Turkey's

****************************************************

Eurasia Group is pleased to announce a breakfast roundtable in the next in
our Eurasia Forum series:

TURKEY'S POLITICAL STABILITY with TANSU CILLER, FORMER TURKISH PRIME
MINISTER

Discussant: TBD

Chair: Ian Bremmer, President, Eurasia Group

DATE: Friday, 4 May 2001
TIME: 8:30am - 10:00am
PLACE: Eurasia Group Executive Offices
461 Fifth Avenue, 14th Floor (enter on 40th Street)
New York, NY  10017

A public row between the Turkish president and prime minister in
mid-February sparked market turmoil that resulted in an overnight 30%
devaluation in the lira and a crash of the IMF-backed stabilization program.
These events led to the resignations of the central bank governor and
treasury undersecretary and have tested the staying power of the country's
three-party government coalition.  In response to this instability, the
Turkish government appointed former World Bank Vice President, Kemal Dervis,
as the new Minister of Economics in hopes of resuscitating the country's
fledgling economy.

Ciller was elected Prime Minister in June 1993; her True Path party led
several coalition governments until 1996.  After losing her seat in 1996,
her party formed a coalition with the center-right Motherland Party which
was followed by an alliance with the conservative far-right Welfare Party.
The later move resulted in heightened tension between True Path and the
military and business establishment.  In the current financial turmoil, Ms.
Ciller has attempted to reposition herself as a force that will regain the
nation's financial and political stability.

Hi Jeff,

I was trying to get a copy of the expense report of Swanswalk (the company
we set up to buy the house in Rio) and I discovered that unfortunately my
copy is in the boxes I sent to London from Brazil and they still have not
cleared customs in the U.K. If you recall, I sent you a copy of the report a
few months ago and I was wondering if you kept a copy in your files. If you
did can you please fax me a copy in the U.K at 011-44-2078239871?

Thanks and I hope all is well with you.

Jeff,

Happy Easter!

A few years ago at the YPO Harvard University, I met a guy from Venezuela.
He and I have kept in contact through the years and we get together from
time to time.  We had dinner a few days ago and he asked me if I thought
you might be interested in meeting with Ali Rodgrigues.  Ali will be in the
US sometimes in May and may be available to meet.  He and my buddy have
been friends for years and I thought I'd extend the offer.  I don't know if
there is an agenda or not.  Those guys are hard to read.  Just let me know
if it's something you want to do.  Otherwise I'll just forget about it.

Keep that stock going up!

-Stan


I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to 
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this 
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise 
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you 
consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)Thanks for the pledge, Loretta!  This was most definitely not directed at you 
- I just wanted each of the assistants to know that I had solicited their 
executive...again...so I bcc'd the assistants.  Thanks for the very quick 
turnaround.  SRS

$50,000 is pre-match, so I guess the ultimate goal is $100,000 (Like the poor

Subject: MS150 interview for A/A Encounter

Jeff,

My name is Samuel Pak, and I'm an Analyst in the A/A program.  I will also be 
riding the MS150 with you and the Team this weekend.  As I did last year, I 
am writing an article on the MS150 for the Encounter.  As such, I was hoping 
that maybe we could chat a few minutes at lunch in Bellville or at dinner in 
La Grange.  If this is OK with you, I will find you and introduce myself, and 
we can go from there.

Much Thanks!
Sam.

Hi, Mark.  Hope you enjoyed Italy - I was in Capri and Positano a couple of 
weeks ago and loved it!

Jeff asked me to write you to see if the plan he is hatching will work for 
you...

He and Jeffrey will fly into Istanbul, arriving on June 24 (he asked me to 
see if you knew the name of the hotel on the Bosporus - sp?)  They would stay 
there until about the 28th or so, then the three of you would head to Nairobi 
and stay at a few places.  Jeff mentioned Mt. Kenya Safari Club and another 
place I can't even begin to spell or pronounce, but I'll figure that out 
later...

You will need to be in Kilimanjaro for the safari on July 4.  The rough 
sketch of the safari is as follows:

7/4 Arrive Kilimanjaro; overnight (O/N) at the Polo Club
7/5 Charter flight to Ngorongoro (fly over Mt. Kilimanjaro); O/N at 
Ngorongoro Crater Lodge
7/6 Ngorongoro Crater tour; O/N at Crater Lodge
7/7 Drive to Monduli GCA; O/N Monduli TGTS camp
7/8 Hiking in Monduli; O/N Monduli TGTS camp
7/9 Flight to Kirawira, western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp
7/10 Western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp
7/11 Flight to Rubondo Island; O/N Rubondo Island camp
7/12 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp
7/13 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp
7/14 Charter flight to Arusha; depart later that evening for the States/Turkey

Hope it sounds good to you.  Please let me know and I'll begin making flight 
arrangements, etc...I'm also collecting all the information with regard to 
required Visas and innoculations (there is a long list!); I'll pass that on 
when I receive it.

I'm heading to Las Vegas tomorrow for a long weekend, so will be in touch 
again early next week.  

Take care, SRSKevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no 
problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner was 
cancelled.

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need 
for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility; 
it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make 
arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from 
where.

The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will 
begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and John 
Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the panel.

I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today, 
so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to call 
me should you have any questions or need additional information as I will not 
have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.

Regards, SRS
Kevin, I'll have a sedan from Beal's (713.731.9233) pick you up at the Four 
Seasons and bring you to the facility.  Once you get inside, there will be a 
check-in table - the ladies manning that table can direct you to Jeff.  Would 
you like me to have the sedan stand by to tke you to the airport or another 
destination following the panel (which will end between 9:30 and 9:45)?  
Please advise.  Thanks, SRS

Subject: HBS May 7 Luncheon - Eugene Vaughan


As President of the Harvard Business School Club of Houston, I along with
the Club=01,s Officers and Directors, strive to host a cross-section of
interesting topics by provocative speakers.  Our May 7 speaker, an HBS alum
and successful Houston businessman, will highlight the results of a
scenario-planning project conducted by some of the most prominent Houston
business leaders.

TOPIC:         Seizing the Future for Houston

SPEAKER:   Mr. Eugene Vaughan, Chairman, Center for Houston=01,s Future

The Board of the Center for Houston=01,s Future recently committed
resoundingly to the creation of Goals and a Strategic Plan for Houston that
will allow our community to achieve its extraordinary potential over the
next decisive 20 years.  This landmark program, already underway, will be
assisted by many dedicated volunteers from throughout the community.  Led
by Chairman Gene Vaughan, the Center, an affiliate of the Greater Houston
Partnership, is focused on very tough questions:  The world and Houston are
changing rapidly - what will be the new reality in 20 years and beyond?
What do we want Houston to be?  What are the obstacles and trade-offs?
Most of all, what plans, resources, determination and leadership are
necessary now to get Houston to its desirable future?  If you are
interested in what can be done to give Houston a great future worthy of its
past - and particularly if you want to get involved - this is an
outstanding opportunity to discourse with one of the citizens leading the
charge.

Gene Vaughan is chairman and founder of Vaughan, Nelson, Scarborough &
McCullough, L.P., an investment management firm originated in Houston in
1970 whose Investment Counsel and VNSM Trust Company manage securities
portfolios for foundations, endowments, corporations and families.

Within his profession, Mr. Vaughan was founding chairman and governor of
the Association for Investment Management and Research, a past chairman of
the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts and a past chairman of the
Financial Analysts Federation.  He is chairman and has served as a director
since 1970 of Dreyfus Founders Group of mutual funds (Denver).

Mr. Vaughan has been a trustee of Vanderbilt University (Nashville) since
1972.  He is a director since 1990 and on the Executive Committee of the
Greater Houston Partnership.  He is Chairman of the Center for Houston=01,s
Future whose mission is to help prepare Houston proactively for future
opportunities and challenges.  Mr. Vaughan is a director of the Houston
Grand Opera Association, a trustee of Goodwill Industries and past chairman
of The Houston Forum.  He was founding chairman of Presbyterian School
(early childhood through grade 8) and served as a trustee of St. John=01,s=
=20
School.

Mr. Vaughan received a B.A. in 1955 from Vanderbilt University, an M.B.A.
in 1961 from the Harvard Business School, where he was a J. Spencer Love
Fellow, and earned the Chartered Financial Analyst designation in 1969.

Jeff, 

I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management 
team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future 
relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his 
direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of 
Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the 
same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard 
you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the 
conference.

Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our 
commercial and real estate business.

Let me know your interest.

Angela - thanks for making time to have dinner with us on Wednesday:  it
was great to see you.

As Art mentioned, since the time we have started working with you, we have
made frequent references to our operating teams about Enron's
accomplishments in the areas of customer excellence and employee
satisfaction.  More generally, we've held Enron out as an example of a
highly accomplished company in all the areas Macerich is currently focusing
on as an organization (operational integration, customer orientation,
scalability, change leadership, and strategic focus).

All of that being said, we would be extremely appreciative of an
opportunity to have either Jeff Skilling or Dave Delainey speak at either
of these conferences.  In any event, we're delighted that you would make an
effort to see if this can be put together.

Relative to upcoming Macerich events, there are two scheduled:

(1) University of Notre Dame Executive Education Program, May 7 - 9 in
South Bend.  The curriculum is centered on change leadership and strategic
thinking (officially "Enhanced Leadership and Strategy in the New
Economy").  Attendees include our Executive Team (Art, David, Rick,Tom, Ed,
and Larry Sidwell) and our Operating Team (17 SVPs).  There is also a
round-table discussion scheduled with our Board on May 9.

(2) Macerich's Company Conference, June 4 - 7 in Park Cities, Utah.  The
emphasis of the conference will be on our "e-Business Transformation" (more
specifically on becoming wholly integrated across functional roles,
customer facing, and highly scalable) and capturing value in our "Value
Network" (relationships we have with retailers, partners, vendors,
shoppers, etc.)  The attendees for this event include the same people at
UND as well as our managerial professionals from the malls and our
corporate offices (about 250 people, total).

Let me know if you need any additional background or information.

Eric






Dave, please disregard my previous e-mail about the date and location in 
June, unless June 4-7 in Park City, UT, is not it.  As Jeff has to be in 
Wyoming on the evening of the 7th, it is possible that he speak in Park City 
that morning and then go on to Wyoming for the dinner he's attending there.  
I'll be back in touch once Jeff has seen this e-mail and responded with his 
interest...SRS

Jeff, 

I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management 
team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future 
relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his 
direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of 
Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the 
same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard 
you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the 
conference.

Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our 
commercial and real estate business.

Let me know your interest.

Hi, Kristin,

Your Dad asked me to let you know that he got your message.  He would like to 
meet you at Maggiones (the place you two met for lunch the first time).  I'm 
making a reservation for you guys in his name at 1:00 p.m. 

Would you please reply to this e-mail so I know you got it?  Thanks, Kristin, 
and have a nice lunch.

SherriThe Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting 
firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, 
their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the 
project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to 
those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in 
the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it 
seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by 
asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices 
and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by 
surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. 

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our 
participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network 
Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 
minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will 
be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific 
practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If 
you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those 
of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the 
survey.  

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for 
contributing to this important learning opportunity.

To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and 
simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron 
Company Code, which is: 

C673EV

Thank you.Good morning Stan.  I am holding 11:00 - Noon on Wednesday for the building 
tour.  I think it would be okay to meet Jeff and Bill Donovan in the lobby.  
Unfortunately Jeff will be leaving to go out of town right after lunch, so I 
don't think that the tour of the Hobby Performing Arts Center will work for 
Wednesday.

Thanks and have a great weekend.

Jay,

I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is 
little overlap.  Having said that, however, I'd like to keep a "last veto" 
right - just give me a call when you've got something.

Good luck to you in the future, Jay.  You'll be missed at Enron.

Subject: My Resignation, and a Question

Jeff-

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  
For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley 
about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily 
for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, 
while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it 
is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I 
will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term 
Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital 
community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future 
payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some 
very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to 
cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think 
that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if 
I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer 
enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned 
professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this 
note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too 
presumptuous!).

Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not 
wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep 
up the great work!

Jay

Karen, heres the version of the PRC memo you should use.  Please call if you 
have any questions.  SRS

Hello Jeff

A voice from the past.  Hope you are doing well.

I wanted to gain your assistance to point me to the most appropriate person
I could interview at Enron.  I am helping a client understand how companies
in the US Natural Gas and Power industry are coping with the challenges in
their industry in terms of developing and retaining the "right skills".
So, someone who could provide an external perspective of how players in the
industry are coping with the challenges as well as an internal perspective
on Enron would be great for me to interview.  If that means more than one
individual, that is fine too.

Hope this is not too much of an imposition.  I'll undertake the
conversation over the telephone and keep it short.

You can reach me on email: sgiridha@prismintl.com or on my cell phone:
240-603-6084.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

Subject: Harvard Forum 05/18/01 - Second Invite


There are only a few available spaces at the upcoming Harvard Forum.  Don't
miss this new and exciting event.  Make your reservations today.  See
meeting details below.
**********************************************

Harvard University Club of Houston - Harvard Forum
=01&Raising Children of Character in A World of Affluence=018
Dinner and Discussion Club

Join us for a new type of Harvard Club experience.  Ever wanted to talk
substantively about a topic, while having a great dinner, but were afraid
that your dinner guests would not be able to go the distance with you in
the conversation?  We have the solution.

Modeled after a format that members David and Anne Grizzle and Danguole
Spakevicius and William Altman have been enjoying for years, the Harvard
Forum will provide an opportunity for an extended conversation with fellow
club members.

The format works like this:  we=01,ll have dinner, and then a panel of Harv=
ard
grads will give brief introductions to the evening=01,s topic from their
perspective, and then we will all engage the topic for ourselves, first in
a large group and then in small groups.  The panel members will be
knowledgeable, but not so expert that anyone will be intimidated.  They
will, however, be provocative to assure that the subsequent conversation is
lively.  You will come away knowing your fellow club members better than
ever - maybe better than you ever wanted.

The topic we=01,ve picked is one with which many of us have struggled.  Our
children may be growing up in a world far more affluent - privileged - than
we enjoyed.  How imperiled is their character by our success?  What
practical steps can we take to insure that we pass along to them the
character values that we treasure?

We plan to schedule a Harvard Forum every quarter.

Because of the format, attendance is limited.  Please respond as indicated
below.

When:    Friday, May 18, 7:30 p.m.
Where:   Briar Club, 2603 Timmons (East Briar Room)
Cost:      $35.00 per person

Reservations:  Email dottie@kerr-solutions.com or call 281/424-3084
(Payment must be made at time of reservation by credit card or mailing
check to 3413 Cobblestone Lane, Baytown, TX 77521-1956.)

For further information, contact David Grizzle (david_grizzle@yahoo.com or
713-324-2966) or Danguole Spakevicius (danguole@fempartners.com or

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can

Does that sound feasible to you?

Dear Mr. Skilling:

I write on behalf of Jerry Murdock, who is currently in Europe.  Mr.
Murdock
asked me to pass on the following information regarding your telephone call
scheduled for 10:00am (CST) on Tuesday, May 15.

Insight Capital hosts a quarterly dinner with Robert Rubin and Steve
Friedman and other selected guests.  Our next dinner is scheduled for July
19 and will be held in Aspen, Colorado.  The Current State of the Global
Market will be one of the topics under discussion and Jack Welch of GE is
one of your fellow invitees.

The purpose of your conversation with Mr. Murdock is to discuss the above
in
more detail and to more fully brief you on the purpose of these dinners.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further
information.

Thank you, Erica.  I'm waiting to Jeff to return from a meeting (within an 
hour or so).  He is currently scheduled to be in Europe the week of September 
24, so at this time, he is not available for a September 25 dinner.  I'll 
advise as soon as I have a chance to speak to him.  Thanks again for your 
help.

Sheri:

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Regards,
Erica Harris

Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of

Gil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, 
but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy 
travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has 
turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit 
the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. 
Quackenbush calls we will decline.

It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.

Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-)

Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet with
them.

Regards,

Gil Marmol

Jeff has asked me to forward Sophia's resume to Celeste Roberts, director of

On behalf of Jeff Skilling, thank you very much for the invitation to speak

intrigued by your offer.  However, given the current demands on his time, he 
must respectfully decline your invitation.

Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level

Hi Jeff.

I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the "truth").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.

I will schedule a "special" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Stephane, I'll be sending to you today checks totaling $22,063.73, which 
represents 53% of the $41,386.23 total pledges.  I'll be contacting people 
today to collect outstanding pledges and will send a "care package" to you 
daily with what I collect.  SRS

Subject: Enron Candidate


Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke 
with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in 
financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set 
relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also 
interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; 
likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of 
the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am 
highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston 
through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any 
opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Jay, Jeff received a call yesterday from a 2nd year HBS student and 
co-founder of a B2B commerce company - Franz Edward Alphonse - who wanted to 
speak to Jeff (for the ever-popular "5 minutes") about his company.  Jeff has 
asked that you follow up with this gentleman.  His phone number is 
617.493.5597.

(Karen, I'm copying you in the event you have any information on Mr. Alphonse 
- i.e., did he interview w/Enron and if so, how did he do).

Thanks, Jay.  Please send Jeff a note with any update once you have spoken to 
Franz.

SRS

PS - I'm back from Italy and ready to have that drink whenever it works for 
you and Greg.  I understand he's out for a few weeks now while he moves his 
family to Houston...



Dear Richard,

I am delighted that you will be joining us in Capri in September.  I am 
confident that you will enjoy the discussions, and I certainly look forward 
to hearing your perspectives.

Within the next few weeks, you will receive the formal invitation along with 
more detailed information regarding the agenda, attendees and 
accommodations.  Should you have any questions or need additional information 
in the meantime, please do not hesitate to call me or my assistant, Sherri 
Sera, at 713.853.5984.

Mr. Krings,

I received your voicemail this morning.  On December 3, I forwarded this

whom to follow up.  He can be reached at 713.853.6161.

Mr. Skilling,

I'm Glenn Krings with Sterling Software in Omaha, Nebraska and I recently
sent you a Priority mail envelope with a letter introducing e_CURE.  In
talking to your secretary, it apparently got lost in the shuffle, so I'm
sending it as an attachment via e-mail. e-CURE is an important new service
to help you reduce the costs of electronic data transmission or EDI.  It
further helps you to insure that the business rules in deregulated energy

Hi, Kristin.  Your Dad asked me to write you and suggest that the two of you 
meet for lunch tomorrow at Grotto on Westheimer at 1:00 p.m.  They don't take 
reservations, but the lunch crowd should have cleared out by that time.  Let 
me know if that's ok with you or if you decide not to drive and need him to 
pick you up.

Have a good time.  SRSHi again, Kristin.  Just wanted to make sure you received my e-mail yesterday 
about meeting your Dad at Grotto (on Westheimer) at 1:00p.  Send me a note 
back and let me know, ok?  Thanks, SRSKristin - you're right!  I didn't realize you and your Dad had talked this 
morning.  Sorry for the confusion!  SRS

Forgot to ask you to let me know when you get the message!  SRSDear John,

On May 9, 2000, you sent a cover memo along with a business proposal for CMI 
to Jeff Skilling.  That e-mail was inadvertently deleted, but fortunately not 
before Jeff saw a printed copy.

Jeff has asked that you send that e-mail to Dan Leff in EES for review.  Upon 
his review, a determination will be made as to whether or not Enron will 
pursue this opportunity.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Hello, Mike.

11:30 still works for Jeff.  Why don't you meet him at the Enron Building 
(1400 Smith Street) - I think you had mentioned that you wanted a quick 
tour.  You'll have to check in at the security desk in our lobby; I'll make 
sure they know that you are expected so they'll give you a visitor badge and 
send you to the 50th floor.

I'm not sure yet where Jeff plans to take you for lunch - anything in

Jeff,

We spent quite a bit of time over the past several months discussing a 
possible minority investment of about $5MM in Silicon Energy.  We have broken 
off those discussions because (1) their proposed pre-money valuation of 
$150MM was, in our opinion, excessive, and (2) our people at EES, who would 
be the primary users of Silicon Energy, were not happy with Silicon Energy's 
functionality.

With this in mind, have you had discussions with John which we should know 
about or which would help give us strategic direction?

Thanks,
Kevin W. Kuykendall

The U.S. Open golf? tournament will be held at Southern Hills Country Club in 
Tulsa next June 11-17. 

With few exceptions the OPEN is never held this far south, thus making the 
event very accessible to those of us in the Dallas area. This will mark the 
3rd Open to be held at SHCC.

I've been asked to assist in the Corporate Hospitality for the event. Because 
of this it is possibly to offer to your clients an invitation to one of the 
world's preeminent sporting events. To see it live , to watch the drama 
unfold in person, is an unforgettable moment. This is one reason why 
companies want to secure a corporate hospitality package. Before I put the 
word out in the Dallas market (and they will sell out soon) I wanted clients 
of MHBT to have the first shot. (I think this is a fair privilage)

The tickets to the event are sold out already, so the only way to gain access 
is via a hospitality package. They aren't cheap but the chance to have a U.S. 
Open so close might never happen again. Prices are from? $28,500 to $150,000. 
These prices range from a table in a furnished, shared pavilion to an 
exclusive environment. 

If you have anyone you think might be interested please let me know and I 
will be happy to visit with them and describe all the amenities associated 
with each option. 

These started to go on sale in the Tulsa marketplace recently and several 
options are SOLD OUT, including a few over $ 500,000.

Since demand is so high and space is limited I will hold off a week before 
making non-MHBT clients aware of this opportunity of a lifetime.

Take advantage of getting your best clients into the 2001 U.S. Open.

Subject: Webley - Telephone Assistant

Since I have been processing the Webley invoices over the last 3 months I've 
have noticed that many of you don't have any or only have very little usage 
on your accounts.   The purpose of this e-mail is to see how many of you want 
to keep your telephone assistant services and who wants to discontinue the 
service, since most of the Webley charges are only service charges and very 
little or no usage.

This is correct.  SRSBy now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you 
with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very 
important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to 
gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their 
associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs 
real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and 
project costing are negatively impacted.
 
We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 
3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline.  
Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Todd Peikert, 
the site manager for the Corporate groups, on what you need to do before June 
30th.  

Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry 
periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) 
at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.

We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a 
success.Jeffrey K. Skilling

Dear?Mr. Jeffery  Skilling?
?
My name is  Scott Berta,?I along with my partners, have created some really 
wonderful  opportunities for companies and individuals to participate in 
company training  combined with corporate philanthropy that benefits our 
community. I will be  meeting with Mrs. Charla Reese and some of her team on 
Monday November, 20th at  2:30pm?(1400?Smith Street in Houston, Texas). We 
will be discussing  implementing these team philanthropic?events at Enron.
?
I know  that Enron is very committed to corporate giving and philanthropy. 
I?read  the wonderful write-up on you and what Enron has done during the MS 
150, in  Philanthropy in Texas magazine.? One of the events that my company  
offers is Bikes for the Little Tykes.? This is an event  that creates team 
awareness along with a powerful sense of giving. The  participates?give the 
bikes that they have put together as a team to  needy?children in their 
community.? Unbeknownst to the participates,  the children are brought into 
the event at the very end of the  program.?Team members are able to?see first 
hand what they  have?accomplished and?that they have really have made a 
difference in  a persons life.? We then go through a debrief session and try 
to help the  participants understand how their "customers", aka the children, 
made them feel  and how they can relate their experience to that of their 
daily  activities.
?
I know  this is short notice, but if you have time on Monday, I would really 
like to  meet you.?I look forward to meeting with you and sharing with you 
what my  company has helped other companies do for their communities and 
themselves.

Hi Mark.  I heard you guys had a great time in Africa - it's hard to believe 
it has already come and gone!

Just wondering if you still have your unused KLM ticket for the 
Istanbul/Amsterdam/Nairobi leg of the trip.  That is a refundable ticket, so 
if you would return it to me I can get Jeff's card credited for the charge - 
I believe it's in the neighborhood of $2,000.  If you have it, just drop it 
in the mail to:

Sherri Sera
c/o Enron Corp.
P.O. Box 1188

I hope somebody got some pictures of that!  SRS

When I got your message, I was certain I had thrown the ticket away.  But, I

The trip did go well; thanks for setting it up.

I'm curious to know whether Jeff kept the ponytail and tattoo?

Dear Ms. Kurz,

I spoke to Mr. Skilling regarding your e-mail below.  Of course he is always 
willing to entertain opportunities for NED's; however, given the current 
demands on his time, it would have to be something pretty significant in 
order that he would pursue and/or accept such an appointment.

With regard to the specific company you have in mind, he is happy to review 
any written information you may have.  Once he has had a chance to review it, 
we will contact you to let you know his level of interest and to set up 
follow-on discussions if appropriate.  By mail or Federal Express, the 
information may be sent to:

Subject: Board Appointments


Dear Jeff,
I am a Partner with Whitehead Mann and rang you today to introduce myself and 
my firm.  We are an executive search consultancy who act for large global 
organizations to find Non-Executive Directors(NED)for their Boards.  At any 
one time, we have a number of European clients who are keen to have American 
nationals join their Boards due to their growing interests in the US.

I am approaching you to see if you would ever entertain taking on a NED 
position.  I have a specific client in mind which is a Paris-based, global 
industrial company with worldwide revenues in excess of $15 billion.

I know that you have just returned from holiday and have a busy schedule over 
the next few weeks, but I would be grateful if you could let me know if you 
would be interested in talking further about Board appointments.  I can be 
reached at 212 551 3552 or via e-mail at your convenience.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: Seminar on Energy Industry Restructuring



Jeff,

The International Energy Agency would like to invite you to speak at a
one-day Seminar on Energy Industry Restructuring to be held on 22 March 2000
here in Paris.  Enron's unique position in the global gas and electricity
businesses and your personal role in bringing that about would be of great
interest to the audience.

The audience will be composed of senior government officials from IEA member
countries who serve as delegates to three of our "Standing Groups" (i.e.,
oversight committees); the Standing Group on the Oil Market, the Standing
Group on Emergency Questions and the Standing Group on the Long-Term.
Chatham House rules will apply (no attribution without permission, no press,
open exchange of ideas).

If your schedule and inclination permits, we would like you to speak for
about 25-35 minutes on corporate objectives and strategies, your experiences
to date and any general plans for the future (that you are permitted to
discuss), with a focus on the gas and electric industries.  Case studies of
particular business developments would be of special interest.

The presentation would be in the second panel of the morning on "Sectoral
Aspects of Energy M&A Activities from a Company Perspective".  The 2-hour
session would start  at around 11AM and would include two other speakers
from Europe covering oil; Michel de Fabiani (President of BP France and
chief architect of the BP-Mobl downstream joint venture), who has
tentatively accepted and electricity; M. Saab, Head of Planning for EdF, who
has been invited, but is checking his schedule.

We are attempting to line up senior officials from the FTC, the EU
Competition Authority and a Japanese energy industry authority for an early
afternoon session to discuss "Public Policy Implications of Energy M&A
Activity".  You might find some useful insights into the possibly disparate
regulatory mentalities in these three regions.

I would be pleased to send you a complete working agenda for the meeting and
a formal invitation letter.

Please give my best regards to Ken Lay.

David

P.S. You may remember me from the days I was running the Energy Group and
Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in the 1980s, and for part of the time
following Enron.  I am now Head of the Oil Industry and Markets Division at
IEA and Editor of the IEA Monthly Oil Market Report.  I hope your schedule
will allow you to come to Paris.

Elvis, 

I cannot open this document either.  I wonder if you could fax it to Rocky at 
713.646.8381.

Subject: Online Foreign Exchange

Jeff:

I am taking the liberty of writing this note to you regarding a tremendous 
potential business opportunity that has to do with trading of Foreign 
Exchange Online . The idea is to bring the clients and the banks together 
where  the banks can bid to buy or sell when business clients wants to buy or 
sell certain currency. My understanding is that the total foreign exchange 
turnover per day is in several trillion dollar range.  Currently, I am 
working in Santa Cruz, Bolivia as President/General Manager of Bolivian 
portion of Bolivia to Brazil pipeline and may not be up to speed on Enron's 
activities in this area.   If we are already doing this, please disregard 
this note and accept my appologies for taking your time and, if we are not 
doing this, here is my two cents worth and let me know if I can do anything 
to implement it. 

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for your leadership 
in making this such a great company. I have been with the company for last 
twenty years and it has been a phenomenal experience. The best part is that 
we have just  began.  I am very excited about  the future growth 
opportunities of  EBS and am looking forward to contributing in that area one 
of these days.  


Regards,

Nasim Khan 


Mark, Jeff asked me to let you know that John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe, 
is expecting your call pursuant to the voicemail and letter you sent.  John 
is very anxious to talk to you.  He can be reached in London at 
44.207.783.6522.  Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Regards,
SherriRoxanne, there may be an opportunity to bring a guest, but I am waiting to 
get RSVPs from the entire group before offering that as tickets are limited.  
I'll be back in touch as soon as I've heard from the entire class.

It's the first picture you've sent that I did recognize anyone!  He looks 
just like his son Jeffrey Jr. in this picture!

I never was able to open the document that was sent twice, which I believe 
had all the details.  I know that there is a party Friday night at Elvis' 
house, but I don't know exactly where that is; and I know there is a football 
game at 11:00a on Saturday, but I'm not sure whether or not Rocky will be 
able to attend.  His significant others' sister is getting married the night 
of 28 Oct, so he must be back in Houston for that.  We'll get him a corporate 
aircraft, though, so he can come and go as he pleases.

That was probably a very long answer to a very short question!  At any rate, 
if I could get the details for the party Friday night, I would really 
appreciate it.  In the meantime, I'll find out if Rocky is planning to go to 
the football game Saturday.

Subject: University of Texas conference on energy finance, February 2001

Jeff,

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.

Vince

Patti, can you believe that out of all those dates you offered that Jeff is 
only available on October 14?!  I have penciled it in on his calendar as has 
Rebecca.  We'll look forward to more details.  Thanks, and have a wonderful 
time in Cabo!  I'm so envious!!!  Sherri

happened, and I don't have the specifics on the funeral arrangements as of
