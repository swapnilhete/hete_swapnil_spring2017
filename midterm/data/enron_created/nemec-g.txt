Dan,  Attached are clean and redlined versions with the changes we discussed 
yesterday.  Please review the exhibits on both documents one last time.

Ken,  Attached is a revised draft of the Hanover Agreement based on all our 
discussions to date.  Please review.  I would prefer one more internal review 
prior to forwarding to Hanover.  Please note where information is still 
needed concerning the specific units for the schedule forms.  Sorry for the 
delay.
Greg,  I have never been to a tasting before.  Will there be some small foods 
to go along with the wine?

Dan,  Attached are the latest independent docs with the Collection Facilities 
funding, construction, and fee structure.  I  am working on a form a 
construction agreement which will be attached as an Exhibit to the Field 
Services Agreement.
Dan,  Attached are the Field Services and Purchase Agreement with the changes 
we discussed.  As we further discussed, there will be a letter agreement 
between Independent and Neidigger (??) which gives independent the right to 
produce and market his gas in accordance with the terms of the attached 
agreements.  Do you have Niedigger real name and type of entity?
Please review and forward to IPC.  This will be required to commit Niedigger 
gas to our purchasing and field services agreements.Trevor,  I created an amendment to the Energy Services Agreement based on 
Paul's letter of April 19.  I think that this amendment is a much cleaner way 
to revised the Schedules to the Agreement.  Please review the amendment and 
schedules.  I revised the schedules further to make the base line 
calculations clearer.  If OK, lets fax a copy to Paul for his review before I 
prepare executables.  Let me know if you have any questions.



Note:  We will also need to have a declaration of HPL and Managing Partner of 
HCC to review and approve this amendment.  Kevin Howard can sign and I have 
already prepared this document.  Here it  is.  Please revise as necessary.

Subject: Right of Way Agreements



     Gerald,

     Please review the attached files and provide comments by August 9.

     The siteag.doc is a proposed Compressor Site Agreement for the Powder
     River Basin.  This document was given to the ROW contractor by a
     landowner in the area.  In paragraph 6, I removed a sentence
     concerning the obligation to fence the site since we were instructed
     to only build a fence around the Main Station.

     The easement file contains a few modifications to accommodate future
     pipelines.  BLUE is where Ted (ROW Contractor) added something, and
     RED is where Ted suggest the wording be removed.  For example, Item
     #1, (the option) we removed because we are ready to obtain the
     easement, rather than only an option.  Item #16 was added to address a
     future line.

     Sincerely,

     Pam Sherman

David,  Attached is a construction agreement draft for a $750,000 gathering 
system between Sapphire Bay.LLC (of which ECT, Jedi II, and Independent are 
members) and Independent as contractor.  Sappire Bay will own the gathering 
system.

Please give me a call to discuss.
Paul,  Attached is the draft of the Agreement for your review.
Ken, Attached is a redline that might make your review easier.  I didn't want 
to forward this one to Hanover.  Let me know if you have any questions.
Attached is a redline with the changes we discussed.  Please review and if it 
looks OK, please forward to Susan and Dave.
The latest and greatest including form of construction agreement.
Lillie,  You might try checking with Jack Simunek.  I am not sure there is 
any documentation on this, but he has a pretty good handle on this issue.  
Jim Coffey at one time issued a one page memo on just this subject.  Might 
also check with him.  Once we decide whether to apply this or not, putting 
this into a contract is a relatively simple matter.

Subject: Tax Gross Up for HPL

Gerald,

Do you have any information on the tax gross up percentage for HPL.?  Also,  
is there an established policy for applying gross up to reimbursable 
projects?  
I have not seen any contract language for HPL projects  that address gross up 
as part of the producer's cost.  I have, however, occasionally seen gross up
included on the work order estimate. 

If you have any documentation, would you please forward to me.

Any chance they could email electronic version of this Agreement?

Subject: Gallup - Continental Divide's contract proposal


Gerald,

I am sending up a copy of the proposed contract structure from Continental 
Divide
who is the local power utility associated with the Transwestern Gallup 
station.

Overall the commercial terms seem to be in line with all the discussions that 
have
been referenced, although there are some issues we want to make vary clear or
more apparent.

1) ECS is agreeing to a 3 yr term "to buy power from Continental Divide" 
assuming
     the merger is completed and power is available to ECS through the No. 21 
tariff.

2) They have provided none of the information concerning a split demand 
charge 
      that totals $12.21/kw.  Discussions reflect that $8.86/kw is avoidable 
and tied to
      their monthly coincidental peak load and the remaining $3.35/kw is a 
base type
      demand.  This is the basis of the rebate mechanism for TW.  Note this 
is also
      a Tri-State portion and part of the tariff 21.

3) ECS is aware of more favourable contract structures that Tri-State has 
negotiated
     and wants to maintain the ability to utilize a more favourable 
tariff/contract structure 
     or to negotiate specifics with Continental Divide post the Tri-State 
merger.   We 
     would still be buying from Continental Divide supporting their 3 yr term.

I am trying to get some written specifics from Continental Divide / Tri-State 
relative
to the demand avoidance since they are currently using this structure today.  
I'll let
you know.

Otherwise I wanted to get the document to you for your review.

Thanks

I would like to take vacation on the following dates:

 July 1 and July 2
 July 8, 9 & 12

Please let me know if these dates are OK with you.



BRENDA:  My first choice for a temp is Chris Koenig, second choice is Terry 
Virgillio (sitting for Erica today).

Dan,  Attached are the lastest turns of Kennedy.  Let me know if you or 
Kennedy have questions.
Attached is the termination letter with my revision.  Both a clean and 
redlined version.
Lisa,    It is extremely hard to watch you struggle through this.  It is hard 
for me also.  I sit up here trying to work when the reality of our current 
situation weighs on me like a ton of bricks.   It is hard for me not to break 
down a couple of times a day, but the pace of my work usually forces me 
through those times.

I don't know if my calling you, asking you to lunch, or holding your hand, 
helps or hurts at this time.  But I am not going to let us give up on each 
other.  My feelings for you run too deep to just try and bury them so that I 
don't have to think about all the pain.

We are both struggling to find a place to start.  I want to start by just 
letting you know that not a day goes by without me thinking of a time when we 
can put this behind us.  I am not sure how to get there right now either.  
However, during those few precious time lately when I get to look into your 
eyes, I see the true Lisa (changed as she is by the last couple of years), 
but still Lisa nonetheless.  I need to get to know this changed true Lisa, 
whatever happens in the near future.

I felt I just to had to write this email.

GeraldBrian,  Attached is a draft of the termination letter.  The letter assumes 
the letter agreement was executed.  There also appears to be an agency 
agreement which appointed Merrick as agent for ROW acquisition.  This is also 
terminated by the letter.  I haven't heard from Shonnie yet.  Please review 
and add any comments you have.  Thanks

G,  How is it going?  Been a while since we spoke.  What have you been up to?

As for me, just a lot of work and little vacation worked in there.  Nothing 
real exciting.  Finally finished the redo of that damn kitchen.  I don't 
think I will be undertaking any home repair projects on my own anytime soon.

I am having Austin withdrawals and need to get back real soon.  It won't be 
long now though for football.  Sounds like Redding and Sims look pretty good 
in practices so far.  That first game makes me nervous.  NC State is a pretty 
good passing team and we may have freshman cornerbacks starting.  

Now for the real subject.  Tailgating.  How is it shaping up this year?  Same 
place, cold beer, good food.  I am definitely coming in for the NC State 
game.  Lisa may or may not be with me.  Don't know yet.  Anyway I will be 
glad to contribute to the cause.    

Drop me a note when you get a chance and fill me in.Dan,  Attached are the 1st drafts.
Dan,  Please disregard the prior draft and use this one.
GT,  The theme of the party sounds excellent.  What time is the party on 
Friday and where does the boat leave?  I may take a day of vacation.  I have 
more than I can probably use this year.

Gerald:

Coleman is ready to sign an LOU and begin the contracting phase; I have had 
numerous discussions with Coleman the past five months and they have seen a 
few versions of the attached term sheet.  I cannot remember if Shonnie has 
reviewed any of the term sheets, so I would appreciate it if you could review 
the latest version of the term sheet and share your suggestions.  (The MDQ 
ratchet in the term sheet is admittedly somewhat confusing...but I'm trying 
to limit the amount of MDQ that ECT holds open for these small companies who 
are just now beginning to drill acreage in undeveloped areas.)  

Thanks.

Please disregard the version I sent about 30 minutes prior and use these.

Dan,  Attached are the drafts with the Collection Facilities language.  Blank 
exhibits for the Security Agreement Form and Insurance requirements.  Will 
forward as soon as I am able to obtain them.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Dan,  Could you ask Denise if all the Lease Agreement are the same form.  If 
not, I need to see all of them.
Tony,  The following steps follow the contract amendment (assumes Bloomfield 
contract):

1.  Calculate the number of hours that the driver was down for force majeure.
2.  Subtract the hours in #1 from the total hours in the month.
3.  Calculate the Monthly Contract Quantity as defined in the amendment 
(Bloomfield -- 7000 times # of hours developed in #2 above)
4.  Calculate the Load Factor as defined in the agreement.

Since we don't have a load factor during those hours of the Force Majeure 
Event, we assume that the unit would have run at the load factor in #4 above 
if not for the Force Majeure event.

Thus, 

5.  Multiply the Load Factor times 7000 (max HP-hrs) times # of hours of 
force majeure event.  This gives you the equivalent HP-hours that would have 
been used during the Force Majeure event or Supply Interruption.
6.  In accordance with the amended Section 3.2(a), to calculate HP-hour 
charge do the following:

 Multiply Conversion Factor (taken from Exhibit based on load factor) times 
(Shaft Energy delivered + Equivalent   HP-hours during Force Majeure [this is 
the number calculated in #5 above]) times 1.031.

Let me know if you have any questions.  We can work through an example if we 
need to.  Thanks.

 I know love isn't enough by itself.  We have to give each other more.  The 
types of things that make the other feel full and complete in life.  We have 
focused on material things,  when really more meaningful things, such telling 
the other that you have an interesting way of looking or thinking about some 
facet of life are what fills each other.  We are both bright and ambituous 
people who should be able to enjoy the finer things in life, but in the right 
context.  Not as direction, but as background to connecting as husband and 
wife.  Husband and wife means many things; friends, supporters, providers, 
sounding boards, lovers,  shoulder to cry on, someone to just hold onto, or 
walk hand in hand on the beach.  I want to do these things for you and want 
you to do them for me.   Hope you can think of me.  

Love,
Gerald Denise,

VALUE AT RISK

 August 25 & 26/September 28 & 29

Can you ....

 Give a precise definition of Value at Risk?
 Describe how VaR is changing the way companies evaluate risk in their 
businesses?
 Discuss how these changing views of risk will impact the use of hedging 
products?
 Define the standardizing practice of Risk Mapping?
 Illustrate a simple VaR model and accurately discuss the modeling process?
 Evaluate the impact of correlation on the calculation of VaR?

An understanding of Value at Risk (VaR) is rapidly becoming an integral 
business need.  The (2 day) VaR seminar is designed to introduce participants 
to this interrelationship of the many factors that make VaR a dynamic and 
strategic tool.  The program ends with a "hands-on" experience of making a 
simple VaR calculation.

If interested, please register through the Development Center or call the 
Ernie help line at ext. 3-0357.

David,  Please review the attached document, specifically Section 6.7.
Attached are the changes we discussed today.
Rude Dog,

Maverick,  It's no good up here.  I'm holding on too tight.  I've lost the 
edge.

Yes, it is close.  I am pretty pumped.  I am also extremely nervous about 
Barnette and their passing game.  Looks like Walker and Hill will be the 
starting corners.  Yikes!  I think our defense will be able to put some 
pressure on Barnette with the type of speed we have at linebacker now.  If we 
don't get any pressure on Barnette, I think we will likely lose this game.  
But I am hopeful that big Shaun Rogers will wreak havoc in the middle.

The offense is still a big questions.  The level of talent on the OL gives me 
comfort.  Davis, Kirk-Hughes (so big they gave him two names), Roesler, etc. 
are all big time.  The 1st series should be really interesting.  I think we 
come out passing lights out to loosen up the run defense.  Then start sending 
Ike off Roesler and Davis.  Occasionally send Flowers down the field on the 
fly and have Applewhite throw it as far as he can.  It is going to be a good 
one.  

Which game is the first one you'll be able to go to?  How are the Australian 
women?  Bring pictures and stories.  Preferably with much embellishment.

Well, only 4 more days to go until kickoff.  What do you think about the 
game?  I saw that we are 9.5 point favorites.  I personally would love to win 
by that much.  NCSt.'s passing attack really scares me.  I guess I still 
don't have a lot of confidence in our CBs yet.  I think that Jammer and 
Jackson(from what I have read) are solid in the middle and our front 4 is 
just plain stout.  We have alot of depth at LB as well, so I guess we will 
need to get maximum pressure on  Barnette to help out JW, EH, AB, & RB.  
Offensively, from what I have been reading, it sounds like Applewhite has 
been very sharp and our RBs aren't going to be as weak as I first thought.  
Also, I understand the OL is coming along quite well.  

So, do we win?  How do you see the game unfolding?  I won't get it out here, 
but I will try to listen to it on the internet.  I can't wait to get back and 
watch these games!

Talk to me Goose.

I recieved both documents.  Thanks.Attached are the revised gas purchase and gathering agreement and the new 
Collection Facilities Agreement.  The Collection Facilities Agreement has the 
insurance requirements but not the Security Documents.  I will forward the 
Security Doc. shortly.
Attached is the security document form.  Section 5.4 is missing and I will 
provide tommorrow.  However, in the interest of time I am forwarding the 
agreement for review.
GT,   I will be coming to this game w/o Lisa.  I plan on driving in Friday 
night and probably getting there about 9:00 pm.  If its okay I'll crash at 
your place.  Let me know how your schedule looks. 

Since Lisa isn't coming I'll have an extra ticket with me on the 35.  
Interested? This version includes the Section 5.4 language.
Attached is a clean and redline version of the documents.  I have the Powder 
River Basin Exhibit and can fax if you want to review. Please note that I 
added a section that allows Enron to relocate units if they are underutilized 
at their current location.  This was resultant of the 5 year term for the 
units contracted for during the initial 2 year period.  
Please read the attached and respond.

Subject: HPLR Processing Agreement Assignment

Steve, Per our previous discussions, I am preparing to draft assignments of 
the following processing agreements (between 3rd Party Processors and HPLR) 
from HPLR to HPLC.    

 King Ranch Processing Plant
 1.  Gas Processing Agreement between HPLR and Exxon Company USA dated July 
23, 1997
  *  Flow up to 10 mmcf/d (Primary Term to Sept. 30, 1999, then month to 
month)

 2.  Gas Processing Agreement between HPLR, HPLC, and Exxon Company USA dated 
May 20, 1998
  *  Processing for EOG BIG Cowboy Gas currently being purchased up to 70,000 
MMBtu (Primary     Term through October 31, 2003
  *  This agreement originally gave HPLR the processing capacity rights since 
HPLR was    originally purchasing the Big Cowboy Gas under the Excess Gas 
Contract.  This contract has   been terminated and HPLC currently purchases 
this gas.  This processing agreement by its   terms reverts the processing 
capacity rights back to HPLC.  However, I will prepare a    confirming 
assignment of this reversion.

 3.  Gas Liquifiables Purchase Agreement between HPLR, HPLC, and Exxon 
Company USA dated October 4, 1996
  *  Processing for Seumar Cage Ranch Field volumes originally purchased by 
HPLR up to 30,000 MMBtu.        (Primary Term through through March 31, 
2001.)  The Seumar contract has been transferred to HPLC.         That 
portion of the contract governing sales of natural gas liquids from HPLR to 
Exxon will be assign to        HPLC.

UPRC Gulf Plains Processing Plant
 1.  This processing agreement has previously been assigned to HPLC. 
==============================================================================
==========================
George,  
Please confirm the above wrt HPLC currently purchasing all the production at 
Big Cowboy and Cage Ranch.  

Karry, 
 Please re-confirm that the above are all the active processing agreement we 
currently have with 3rd Party Plants.

Please let me know if there are any comments or issues with regard to such 
assignments.  Along with such assignments, notification of assignment letters 
will be prepared and forwarded to Exxon.  


Attached are the executable documentsBob,  Please print out 2 copies and have Hanover execute.  Please fax 
signature today to me at (713) 646-3490 and FEDEX or Courier complete 
contracts to me at:

Thanks for your help.
G,  I will be there about 9 pm tonight.  My cell phone # is 281-772-9250I am fedexing the form of lease this morning.  Sorry for the delay.Oooouch!    That one hurt.  We really kicked their butt all over the field.  
The defense played well, especially Ahmad Brooks.  I don't think he had one 
completed on him all night.

What really sucks is that we just gave this game away with the punting team.  
I am trying not to get too down about this.  This is  a young team that is 
going to make mental errors and they will improve.  I still thinks we will 
have a good season. 

The only freshman I saw getting any PT was Cory Redding.  He looks fast out 
there and really crushed somebody on a kick off return.  He also got some 
snaps at DE on a couple of 3 and longs, but didn't do anything outstanding.  
Unfortunately he was also out there on the punt team during the debacles.   

Victor Ike should be our starting tailback.  He look big and fast and gets 
yardages running in the interior.  Ike left a defender looking really stupid 
on his long TD run.  Sweet moves.  Hodges look about like he did last year.  
Had a couple of good runs but doesn't seem to use his blocking very well.

OK, so we will begin our win streak with Stanford.   The thing I really like 
was that Mack said he takes full responsibility for the punting problems and 
that he will insure that they get fixed.  Mackovic would have made excuses 
that essentially put the blame elsewhere.   This season could be an up and 
down one, but the real prize is next year and the years after.

Did you get any info on the game?G,   

I was thinking of bringing along a friend from Enron to the boat party.  
Unfortunately he is not a female so this may throw off your proper party 
ratio.  He is married though so he will leave the single girls alone for you 
and me.  His wife is out of town this weekend.  He won't mind sleeping on the 
floor.  

Thanks for letting me hang at your place this weekend.  Lisa is a really cool 
girl.  You two will have fun together.    Attached are the latest versions.  Call me if you have any questions (713) 
853-3512.
Mark,  Attached are the letter agreement and Purchase and Sale Agreement.  
Please review.  Note there is a blank date in the letter agreement which 
needs to be provided.  If OK I will forward to TW.

Here they are.  I will probably hear from Kathy later today as to whether or 
not they need any changes.



Since HPL Resources & Houston Pipe Line have several RRC System Numbers, the 
2nd attachment is the exhibit that goes with the 1st letter.  But, ECT only 
has one RRC System Number since they don't own any pipe, so that letter 
doesn't need an attachment.

Connie,

I just wanted to let you know that since I was already working with the 
Railroad Commission (RRC) to get HPL Resources Company automatically replaced 
with Houston Pipe Line Company as purchaser on the P-4's, I went ahead & 
drafted a letter to do the same for the change from ECT to Enron North 
America Corp.  I faxed both letters to Kathy Way at the RRC, who is 
responsible for all automatic P-4 changes.  She will let me know if the 
letters look okay.  If so, I will need to get the appropriate officers to 
sign them & send them to her at the RRC.  Since she only does this at the 
beginning of the month & doesn't backdate the effective date, the change will 
be effective 10/1/99, assuming we have a P-5 in place for Enron North America 
Corp. before then.

The current P-5's are filed thru Gerald Nemec's office.  Will they be filing 
for this new one?  If not, do you want me to pursue this?  Please let me know 
so that we can get this completed in a timely manner.

Thanks.

I am not sure if these letter were sent out yet or not.  My only comment

ECT to ENA.   The latter is effective Sept.1, 1999.   If you have any

FYI:

The HPLR to HLPC change isn't a name change.  It is just numerous assignments 
from HPLR to HLPC.  From what I've been told, HPLR is still a good company 
for now.

As far an an effective date, the actual name change from ECT to ENA is 
effective 9/1/99, but since we don't already have our paperwork into the RRC 
requesting the automatic P-4 change, the RRC will make it effective 10/1/99, 
provided we have all of our paperwork into them before then.

The date of most of the assignments from HPLR to HPLC (some via ECT first) is 
7/1/99.  But, again, as far as the P-4 changes are concerned, the RRC will 
make them effective 10/1/99, since they don't backdate automatic changes.

I spoke to Kathy Way at the RRC again this morning.  She said that the 
letters are fine from their perspective.  I just need to get the appropriate 
signatures & mail them to her.

But, they can't do anything with the ECT to ENA changes until ENA has a valid 
P-5 number.

QUESTION:  Will your office be doing the paperwork to get a P-5 number for 
ENA?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Some further detail on the site lease agreement:

CounterParty is Black Hills Trucking, Inc

Include is existing 40 ft. X 40 ft. building on site.
Enron reserve right to install any other building reasonably necessary for 
site to function as an equipment laydown yard
Enron reserve right to install septic system for bathroom in buildings used 
by Enron
Enron needs access at all times through Black Hills front gate to get to site.
Enron will remove all equipment and buildings (except existing) upon 
termination.Please see attached

                 great traditions of OU were also a factor according to 
Waylon, "They
                 have this great tradition where they touch all the movie 
posters of OU
                 legend Brian Bosworth before running out onto the field. You 
just don't
                 get that kind of inspiration outside of OU." Attached is a discussion draft of the Compression Services Agreement for

legal is included in Corporate.  We'd really like to have you attend our 
campaigner training session Monday.  See the details below and let me know if 
you can make it.  If you can't attend, I will send you instructions on what 
to do.  Mainly, it's distributing pledge cards to employees in your group and 
following up to see if they've turned in their cards.  I look forward to

To  United Way Campaigners

From:  Mary Clark, Ginger Gamble and Karen Myers

ACTION REQUIRED!

You've been selected by your department head to be a United Way campaigner 
for employees in your group.  We are delighted to have you as a participant 
and look forward to working with you on this year's United Way campaign.  
We're already off to a great start with the solicitation of Enron's executive 
group.  You are the important link to employees, so your role as a campaigner 
will help Enron to achieve its 1999 United Way goal, which is $2,044,000.

We are hosting a training session for all Corporate Staff campaigners Monday, 
September 13, from 11:30 am. to 1 p.m. in EB47C2.  EatZi's will provide a 
delicious hot lunch and we, your hosts, along with a representative from 
United Way, will provide the "entertainment" -- giving you helpful tips on 
how to be a successful campaigner for Enron's United Way campaign.  We also 
will answer any questions you might have.

R.S.V.P. to Mary Clark by email or voicemail (3-7325) no later than Friday, 
so we can give a headcount to Eatzi's.   We do apologize for the short 
notice.  If you cannot attend, don't worry, we will send you the campaigner 
training materials.  

Thanks for your support.






The operations information you requested should now be directed to Robert 
Morgan in Facility Planning.  I forwarded the sheets you left in my office 
last week to Robert for his review.  I handled this request before when I was 
in Facility Planning, but Robert has now taken my place.  Shonnie Daniel will 
work with you from the Legal Group perspective to give you any help you need.

Lisa,  I feel so bad right now.  I never wanted anything but to be with you 
and love you the rest of my life.  I wish we knew how important it was to 
communicate with each other over the past years.  I think we are both guilty 
of not communicating.  It is easier to talk to some besides each other about 
certain things because of certain expectations or assumptions that have been 
built up over our portion of a lifetime together.  It hurts to now clearly 
understand this after things have happened.

I am scared of you moving in with Chris because I fear that we both may 
accept it as final.  I don't want it to be that and I want us to genuinely 
work on this relationship.  I want us to talk and do things together.  You 
are my one true love.Melissa,  I wasn't able to redline this version, but I added sections 10 and 
11 and added futher language to Sections 3 and 6.  Hopefully you can redline 
it against your old version.  

Let me know what you think about environmental indemnity language.  I think 
is is prudent from the view that Black Hills and has been using the Premises 
for some time and we are not sure what is out there.
The easment was sent off for recording, but I have not recieved the recorded 
copy from the county yet.  As soons as I receive it, I will forward to John.

Subject: Spanish Camp to Mobil Vanderbuilt 14-inch interconnect

Glenn,

Mary Jo Johnson is working on a facilities agreement with Mobil to 
interconnect the Spanish Camp 6-inch line to the Mobil 14-inch Vanderbuilt 
pipeline.  HPL will be responsible for setting a 6"x6" tee, riser, and 
above-ground valve on the Spanish Camp lateral.  I suggest the 6x6 because 
the gas sales contract that will go along with the facilities agreement 
should specify an HPL scheduled delivery rate from 0 to 20,000 MMBtu/d.  The 
6-inch will minimize pressure losses off of the Spanish Camp line and will 
maximize our ability to expand this point in the future, if necessary.  
Assume that we will need to acquire a small section of surface easement for 
the above-ground valve.

Looking at our as-built drawings (HC-1025-09-H) it appears that the Mobil 
line crosses the Spanish Camp 6-inch at Station Plus 77+40 in the middle of a 
pasture.  I spoke with Lonnie earlier today, who said that he would be in 
that area on Wednesday and can verify that I have correctly located the 
line.  The crossing pipeline is incorrectly identified as a 16-inch Natural 
Gas line on the as-built.

Mary Jo has asked for some agressive timing on setting the tee, in that she 
would like to have it set for an 1 October, 1999 completion date.  In that 
light, would you please approach this from the perspective of preparing a 
work-order rather than a preliminary cost estimate.

If any of these specifications change, I will let you know immediately.

Thanks,

Ken,  I sent, via fedex, an agency agreement to you a couple of weeks ago.  
The agreement appointed ENA as Crescendo's agent to nominate and resolve 
allocations and imbalances on Wildhorse's system.  Wanted to see if you have 
reviewed and executed yet?  

Jack,  Attached is the Release, Settlement, and Termination agreement we 
discussed.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
Attached are redlined and clean CSA and Gas side agreement.  Please review.  
I am going to make further refinements over the weekend before we send to 
Drew.
Lauri,   From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on an 
interruptible agreement at our discretion.  The contract clearly gives us 
this right.  I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assuming 
it is our standard form.  I will check this.

Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact that 
this goes to Entex first complicates the issue.  

Dan,  was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or if 
it ultimately ended up at state facilities?

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.



I'll check the Global Database to see if I can find it.  Did Shonnie paper 
that purchase agreement?

The only purchase agreement I have not been able to locate is the Howell one 
(wind river), I will let you know as soon as I have it.  Let me know if you 
need anything else.

Lauri,  I reviewed the contract with TGLO.  It is a standard interruptible 
form, so we should have no issues with interruption of the gas flows.  I also 
talked further with Dan concerning the contract.    We feel that the 
agreement strictly refers to facilities that are directly operated by the 
state (e.g. universities and prisons) and not school districts.  Thus, we 
would consider HISD to not be state facilities.  This argument is not a slam 
dunk, but we should probably take this approach and see how they react.  The 
contract also refers to gas "destined" for state facilities.  So the fact 
that the gas goes through another pipeline before being delivered to a state 
facility does not matter.  It ultimately is "destined" for state facilities.

Lauri,   From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on an 
interruptible agreement at our discretion.  The contract clearly gives us 
this right.  I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assuming 
it is our standard form.  I will check this.

Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact that 
this goes to Entex first complicates the issue.  

Dan,  was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or if 
it ultimately ended up at state facilities?

Hello,

I work in Applications Integration on the GEM Project (Windows 2000 
rollout).  It is our mission to ensure that all applications are tested and 
packaged for use with Windows 2000 so that the Enron user community can be 
migrated to Windows 2000.  I am contacting you because we have identified the 
current version of HTS32 as not compatible with Windows 2000 and I found your 
name in the application group as one of the users of this application.

I need your help in gathering the following information:

Who is the "owner" of this application (the person who can tell me if it is 
still needed)?

Is it still used?

Has it been replaced by another application or a web based application?  If 
so, when and which application?


If it is still used:

Vendor (or developer) name?  (please include any contact info. you may have: 
web site, contact, phone number).

Who can work with me to obtain the new version (if needed) and test it?

Who uses it (if this list is too large, just note the approximate number of 
people)?

Do you foresee that this application will go away in the next couple of 
months? 

Is your maintenance contract up-to-date?


Please contact me at your earliest convenience.

Thank you,

Under term7:  Notices - unless we include language similiar to...'Fax is 
acceptable as long as the fax is followed by hardcopy documentation and 
effective upon such hardcopy reciept.'  Back to square one.  They don't like

Under term 8:  they are objecting to affiliate assignment.  Successor is ok.  
Affiliate assignment is no good.  They would like to take out the term

Dwight,  Attached is a form O&M Agreement that was recently used on power 
project in the US.  This form is very similar to the one you forwarded Steve, 
but is more detailed in the Scope of Services to be performed.  There are 
performance bonuses and penalties for electricity output.  We would have to 
add the steam output.  Should be very similar.  I think this form can be 
turned around to Coogentrix fairly quickly once we establish what the 
performance standards to be met are.  I will be out of the office on Jan.2 
but will be back on Wednesday.  Please review.  I apologize for not getting

Corp.  was performing these efforts.  (If an entity other than ENA has the 
contract with Gordonsville, the letter should be changed to reflect the 
proper entity.  I removed the discussion concerning demand for cover from 
Citgo.  Per our discussion, we don't have that right under the contract, and 
since our contract is best efforts, Gordonsville doesn't have the right to 
demand cover.  I think this letter should be strictly a notice out of curtesy

you have any questions.  (281) 772-9250.

Gerald,

As we discussed earlier, following is a list of the high points agreed upon 
in yesterday's meeting with Hanover.  Hopefully this is enough to get a draft 
of a letter agreement going.

- the compression services agreement will be terminated
- there will be a 90 day transition period starting 1/1/01within which 
Crestone will build up an operations and maintenance strategy
- during the 90 day transition, Crestone will make an election as to whether 
we want all of the O&M, part of it, or recontract with either Hanover or 
another 3rd   party  (basically we want the flexibility to do anything we 
want).
- Hanover will provide to us a rate stucture that will be in effect during 
the 90 day transition.  We talked about covering their costs (under a flat 
monthly fee) plus  a 15 to 20% markup.  We also agreed to meet with them very 
soon to define exactly who does or pays for specific services.
- We will need to address the way new units will be ordered in the future.  I 
have not worked on this yet.
- Hanover made the committment to maximize on line availability of their units
- There will be a 2 year term during which Hanover will be Crestone's 
"preferred provider" of either rented or purchased machines.  This needs to 
be   structrured so that we dont necessarily have to use them.The term will 
start 1/1/01.

Thanks for your help.  Let me know if I can fill in some of the details for 
you.

KenBrant,  Attached is the executable guaranty with the notice language 
included.  Let me know if you need anything else.
Ken,  Attached are the letter which allow us to disclose certain information 
under the Tom Brown confidentiality agreement to third parties and a nom 
letter for Jan - 01.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
Hi Melissa,  What up? Just stuck here working late on a project and thought I 
would drop you a line to see if you were still alive.  Hope you had a great 
Christmas and New Years and were able to enjoy some time off.  I spent most 
of it up here working.  The workload has been incredible.  

Take care,

Steve,  I won't be there, but I did leave Shari a voice mail concerning the 
PGT Transaction we just completed.  The firm PGT capacity is ours through 
Nov. 1, 2008.  The remaining term is being released to Calpine.  The Capacity 
Release was just posted and should be completed by Jan 31, 2001.   I don't 
have a copy of the contract, but Stephanie Miller could provide that if 
needed.  It is a standard FTS-1tariff form.  This transport also backs the 
Canadian Producer Net Back deals.  Peter Keohane would be the one to talk to 
about these producer deals and their relation to the PGT Capacity.

Gerald,
PGT
Can you go? You have the most current understanding of the PGT capacity, its 
current rights and obligations.  I have a meeting at 3:30 that I could cut 
short. What's your view.

Dan,
PG&E Texas (Valero) 
Do you think that all the PG&E Texas transport is relevant to this Bankruptcy 
Due Diligence issue since those assets should now be owned by El Paso? 
Understanding what our rights are or are not as to prior periods imbalances 
would be an interesting bankruptcy law exam given that ENA's been operating 
under an "unexecuted" header/transport contract with PG&E Texas for the past 
2 to 3 years.

Thanks very much for the information on the PGE trading contracts.

Outside counsel is developing a form of "matrix" that they would like us to 
complete on each of the contracts.  I expect that you will have already done 
most of the work to complete that matrix with respect to your contracts, but 
we will need your help in completing the matrix and possibly digging up some 
additional information.  I will forward the matrix to you when I receive it.

I know how busy everyone is, and really appreciate your prompt response in 
this matter.  As you know, the situation in California is critical, and 
completion of this due diligence effort is key to our ability  to respond to 
the situation.

Based on the current draft of the O&M agreement, we do have the ability to 
(i) terminate each agreement for a one time fee of $200,000, or (ii) suspend 
all or a portion of the O&M services for a period of time and the parties 
would then meet to determine a mutually agreeable adjustment to the then 
current Operating Fee.  Let me know if you have any questions.

In considering the worst case scenario...

The Force Majeure provision seems reasonably broad in the Steam Purchase 
Agreement.  Would we be able to rely on this at some point to suspend our 
steam supply to AKF in the event, for unforseen reasons, we could not obtain 
an Interconnection Agreement or transmission capacity to transport power from 
Elizabethtown and Lumberton?
Also, if it were determined that we could not sell power from the sites, can 
we terminate or downsize the scope of the O&M Agreement?

left that place.  I went down to CC the next day and told my parents we had
met.  They said they had just been at your wedding not to long before
Christmas.  Small world!

How's Houston treating you?  Been back to Kenneally's since?  Drop me a
line when you get a chance.

Gerald,
Yes,  It depends on when and how much.  Any details yet?

I think we are finally in agreement on the agency agreement.

Ken,  Attached is the revised agency agreement.  I accepted all you changes
you forwarded earlier and added an indemnity section.  Please review and
let  me know if you want to discuss.

(See attached file: Crescendo-agency rev2.doc)

Mark,  Attached is the revised letter agreement.  Please review and if 
acceptable forward to Gulf.  In addition to the items you and I discussed, I 
also added an arbitration clause.   This is standard for all Enron deals.   
Please let me know if you have any questions.
Is this being looked at as an ENA acquistion also, or solely a Crescendo 
acquisition?

It's going great!
I told my folks as well and they were pretty surprised.  Houston has been
good to us so far.  Although I have been working my butt off, so I haven't
seen much of it.  I heard you play the guitar.  We could have a little
partridge family band because I play the drums.  Anyway I have been itching
to play for about 3 years (I have been in apartments for that long), so we
should get together and jam if you are interested.
I'll talk to you later,

Clement, Enron Corp. currently has an executed guaranty for up to $12 mil 
which guaranties Bridgeline Gas Marketing LLC deals with Superior Natural Gas 
Corporation.  ENA owns 40% of Bridgeline.  The guaranty severally obligates 
Enron Corp. for 40% of the $12 mil and Texaco Inc. for the other 60%.  The 
attached amendment increases the guaranty amount to $25 mil per Superior's 
request.  Please review and if acceptable obtain execution by Enron Corp.  
Please call me at x-33512 with any questions.  

Brant,  This form will probably work for the Texaco guaranty also.  I don't 
have a copy of the Texaco guaranty though and I need to review it to make 
sure it is identical to the Enron form.  Can you obtain a copy for me?
They are based out of Salt Lake City, Utah.

Brant,  Any luck obtaining a word file for the Potash Guaranty or the 
Bridgeline Credit Services Agreement?Sorry, Sorry,

I missed your birthday last week.  Hope you had a great birthday with Will 
and his family.  Are things going well in the Big D?  I have been doing 
fine.  Work keeps me pretty busy.  

Happy Birthday!

Gerald  Bill,  I am forwarding an agreement I have discussed with Susan Clark last 
week.  She suggested I forward this to you.  The attached agreement addresses 
the power line facilities for Enron Compression Services Company's electric 
motor drivers in Florida.  The agreement has been highly negotiated to this 
point, but I wanted to get your general view of the structure prior to 
executing this with Gulf.  We are trying to execute quickly.  Susan could 
give you more context on our situation with Gulf.  Please call me if you have 
any questions (713) 853-3512. 
This doesn't explain Friday night, though.

Attached please find both blacklined and execution of the respective O&M 
Agreements for the 2 facilities, excluding certain exhibits.  Jay Sonneburg 
with Bracewell will be taking the execution copies with him in order to get 
the 2 LLC's signature when Enron takes control of the LLCs.

Jay will attach Schedule 1 to each agreement which is a description of the 
facilities.  My understanding is that Dwight will be forwarding electronic 
versions of Schedule 2 - Permits and Schedule 3 - Budget for both 
agreements.  All other schedules are already attached to the agreements 
themselves.

Because I will be out of the office most of the day tomorrow in meetings and 
Jay will have his hands otherwise very full at the closing, I would suggest 
getting with me asap on Tues. if any material changes are needed.  At this 
point I would not recommend changing any non-material changes.

 - PSA.DOCChris,  The original transaction agreement were done via fax.  We only have 
fax copies. The two amended and restated transaction agreement #2's he sent 
on Dec. 21 were inadvertently not executed by Huber.  I sent them back, but 
somewhere they got lost in the shuffle.  Let's have him execute the copies 
you left with him.

Gerald/Mark - I dropped off the Huber contracts as follows:

Trailblazer Assignment and Assumption Agreement - dropped off one original 
for execution.  The VP was not there to sign.  We should receive the executed 
original back from Huber this week.  Thereafter, all three originals go to 
Trailblazer for signature.

Capacity Assignment and Prearranged Release Agreement - gave original to 
Brian Stone.

Amended and Restated Transaction Agreement #2 - Brian stated that he mailed 
the two "Huber" executed originals to Mark Whitt on 12/21/00.  I left the two 
(replacement) unexecuted agreements with him in the event Mark cannot locate 
those mailed in December.  Mark - do you have these?  Let me know ASAP.

Enfolio Master Firm Purchase / Sale Agreement - dropped off two originals for 
execution (to replace the fax'd version).  Should get back this week.

Original Transaction Agreement - Brian only has a fax'd copy.  He wants to 
know if there is an original that exists.  Let me know if we have any 
originals or whether the deal was originally done over the fax.

I need help putting some furniture into  a U Haul tomorrow at Heather's

understand if you are busy. Ernie lives in Tomball. Maybe we can get a hold
of him too.

Let me know dude.

Per our discussion attached is the revised CSA.  I will forward the revised 
Lease and O&M Agreements (reflecting the equipment change) early next week.
Ken,  Attached is a draft of my comments to the gathering agreement.  I have 
made it clear in the language that the agreement is fully interruptible at 
our discretion.  The agreement is still a keep whole on the liquids.  I did 
not change this section.  Also I did not review or change Exhibit A.  I will 
leave that to you.
Barbara,  Attached is the term sheet with my revision.  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.
Brian,  Thanks for the camping trip this weekend.  It did help me clear my 
mind and sort some things out.  This is a tough time right now, but having 
good friends like you will help me get through this.  Thanks again.

I also wanted to clarify a point on the Tom Brown form of gathering 
agreement.  The revised form is an interruptible agreement with no acreage 
dedication.  Since Tom Brown removed all the acreage dedication language, it 
is my understanding that they were not willing to give us an acreage 
dedication.  To the extent we modeled our economics on any Tom Brown 
production, I wanted to make sure everyone understands that these volumes are 
not committed to the system we are purchasing and can be taken by Tom Brown 
to someone else at their discretion.
Per your voice mail, attached is the TBI proposal as revised.

Sorry not to respond until today, I was in SA yesterday.

I meant to ask you if were going for one or two nights.  Now that I see you
plan to stay only Sat night, I'll see if I can go.  Where are you/we
spending the night?

George called and left me a message that the email address on my card wasn't
working.............looks like it worked for you.

I'll talk to the wife today about going - what time on Sat were you thinking
about going?

Gerald,

Greg and SCS recommended we put a cap in for our expenditures on operation 
costs that HPL was willing to eat for the HPL Operated Facilities.  I have 
modified section 5 accordingly for your review:

5. Operation.  RNP shall operate and maintain the RNP Facilities in 
accordance with sound and prudent natural gas industry practice and shall be 
fully responsible for the routine operation and maintenance thereof and for 
all cost and expense associated therewith.  HPL shall operate and maintain or 
cause the operation and maintenance of the HPL Facilities in accordance with 
the Standards and with sound and prudent natural gas pipeline industry 
practice and shall be fully responsible for the operation and maintenance 
thereof and for all cost, expense and risk associated therewith.  HPL shall 
operate and maintain or cause the operation and maintenance of the HPL 
Operated Facilities in accordance with the Standards and with sound and 
prudent natural gas pipeline industry practice and shall be fully responsible 
for the routine operation and maintenance thereof and for all cost, expense 
and risk associated therewith, except RNP shall be fully responsible for any 
cost and expense associated with any repairs, maintenance, and capital 
expenditures that are in excess of $3,000.00 for a single item (the 
"Maintenance Items").  HPL shall invoice RNP for the Maintenance Items 
performed by HPL on the HPL Operated Facilities, and RNP shall pay such 
invoice within 15 days of its receipt thereof.  RNP shall be responsible for 
any Meter Fee assessed, as defined in Section 3 above, and for the electric 
power and phone service, required for the Interconnect.

 <<Draft dec statement ECS.doc>>

Gerald,
I have converted the draft joint petition that was faxed to you earlier this
afternoon from a WordPerfect file to a Word file.  The converted document is
attached.

As we discussed, we are hoping to receive both your feedback and the
additional information you have agreed to provide ASAP.  We are trying to
work on finalizing the document in time to work out the logistics for filing
by the end of this week.

Our goal is to try and have a signed document in our possession early Friday
morning so that it can be carried to Tallahassee for filing at the FPSC
later that morning.  One of our executives is traveling to Tallahassee that
day for a meeting and has agreed to serve as a courier if the document can
be completed in time.  As we also discussed, if you have Tallahassee counsel
available to sign the final, we can make arrangements to carry the document
to them for signing on Friday and still make the filing on Friday as
desired.

Tim has sent you the original letter agreements and contract for electric
service via FedEx for signing.  Upon execution of the originals, please
return two executed copies to us via FedEx.  This should allow us to have
the executed documents in our possession by Friday, February 16.  Of course,
the documents should be dated 2/13 and signed by the same individual who
signed the fax copies that were returned to us earlier today.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at
850/469-3313 or Tim Anthony at 850/444-6678.  One of my partners is also
working on the joint petition.  His name is Russell Badders.  In case you
need to speak to someone when you cannot reach me, Russell can be reached at
850/469-3316.

We appreciate your efforts as we continue to work together to make this
project happen.

Thanks!
--Jeff:)

Gerald,

I booked the reservation below through my Frito-Lay travel agency.  I think I
can probably book you another room at the same rate if you'd like.  This is 
for
the Marriott Capital for $129 a night.  The Sheraton rooms would have been 
$125
but they were sold out.  The Marriott is actually closer to the reception (2
blocks) than the Sheraton, so we'll be able to walk over.

Let me know and I'll try to get another room.

		 Subject: Conversation with Petrie Parkman on WEP acquisition


We finally had a conversation with Bill Garner at Petrie Parkman late
Wednesday afternoon, 2/21/01.  Tom Brown representatives are not discussing
the status of the WEP acquisition with any entities.

Bill informed us that they are in negotiations with a single entity for the
entire Wildhorse Package as included in the data room plus some additional
Colorado assets that were not included in the package.  Bill also informed
us (and the reason he returned our call) is that he indicated he believes
the entity would be "friendly" to Crescendo  and has expressed interest (to
them) in "working with us" on our project and plans.  We reminded him that
there are still issues with our existing contract that need to be
expediently resolved, and we aren't going to wait 6 months to resolve these
issues.  He assured us that Tom Brown is very aware of contractual issues.
He indicated that the entity wanted to contact Crescendo now (before
execution of the PSA), but TBI insists on working through PSA issues before
contact with Crescendo.  A PSA review meeting is scheduled for next week.
Bill said he would make introductions for us as soon as the PSA is executed.

Bill also informed us that it was TBI management that made the decision to
sell all the assets instead of breaking up, even if breaking up brought a
higher sale price.

Staci,  Attached is the final draft of the petition we are jointly filing 
with Gulf Power Company.  The plan is to file it tomorrow in Tallahassee.  I 
will get with you shortly on finalizing the CSA amendments.
Mark,  Attached is the confirm for the Nymex.  I revised it to reference the 
new master to be signed this month.
Mark,  Attached is the confirm with my revisions.
Mark,  Attached is the revised confirm.  I added a provision which requires 
AEC to execute a new master as soon as reasonably possibly and upon such 
execution this TA and all TA's between AEC and ENA in place will be governed 
by the new Master.  Let me know if that meets your understanding.
That's disgusting.

I usually don't forward e:mail messages en masse.  I made an exception in 
this case because I found the issue compelling. I also found completing and 
submitting my responses to the attached survey to be quick and straight

I hope you will take a few moments to consider the attached tax survey and

Subject: Bush Tax Cut


** 2nd Alert from MillionsofAmericans.com**

President George W. Bush needs your help to build more
support for his tax cut proposal.

In the last week or so two Republican Senators (Lincoln
Chafee of Rhode Island and James Jeffords of Vermont) have
withdrawn support for the Bush plan.

Two more GOP moderates (Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and
Olympia Snowe of Maine) are threatening to oppose the bill
if major details of the tax cut are not changed.

Remember, the U.S. Senate is split 50-50.  That means every
Republican vote we lose and every Democrat vote we gain is
absolutely critical.

Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform (ATR) has been
called upon to help make sure the President's plan gets
through Congress.

One way they're going to help President Bush is by
convincing Senators who are on the fence that a majority of
American taxpayers -- like you and me -- want them to stand
firm on the key points.

To accomplish this goal, ATR put together a quick taxpayer
survey on their web site.  The results of this survey will
be presented to every U.S. Senator and House Speaker Dennis
Hastert.

Here is a link: http://www.atr.org/A426.htm

Here is a list of their questions:

#1 Do you support tax cuts for all Americans?

The Democrats in Congress want targeted tax cuts for people
who meet certain income and behavioral categories.
President George W. Bush has proposed cutting everybody's
taxes.

#2 Should we kill the Estate Tax (also called Death Tax)?

You pay taxes all of your life. Should your loved ones be
forced to sell off your family business, family farm or
heirlooms to pay up to 55% in taxes when you pass away?

#3 Should we abolish the marriage penalty?

Right now, our government is punishing couples for
getting married by bumping them into higher combined tax
brackets.

#4 Do you favor making the tax cuts retroactive to Jan 1st
2001?

President Bush's proposed tax plan provides relief to our
families and stimulates our economy right now by making tax
cuts retroactive to the beginning of this year.  That way
you'd see your tax cut in this year's paychecks.

Each of these questions are up for debate over the next few
weeks and months while Congress decides the exact size and
scope of the tax cut.

I strongly encourage all taxpayers to stand up and be
counted by visiting the ATR web site and answering these
questions.

In addition to providing the survey results, Grover wants to
be able to show our leaders in Congress that hundreds of
thousands of Americans participated in this survey --
so please take a minute to respond and SPREAD THE WORD!!!

Here is the link again: http://www.atr.org/A426.htm

Check it out.

For Integrity,
Bruce Eberle
MillionsofAmericans.com

PS: Full details of President Bush's tax cut plan are available at the ATR
site.

		 Subject: PSA for Harley Dome O&G Acquisition


Gerald,

I am sending you the PSA and Escrow agreement for the acquisition of the
Harley Dome Oil and Gas Leases.  This lease contains mostly helium reserves,
with little oil or gas value.  We plan to execute this PSA with the Oil and
Gas Owner next week, and put the downpayment in escrow at our bank here in
Midland.  We expect a due diligence period of 1-2 months, due to waiting on
the outcome of the lawsuit involving the helium rights owner or agreement on
a deal with the helium rights owner.  There are no producing wells on the
acreage (all P&A'd or TA'd).  We would do some due diligence upon execution.

Scott asked me to have you look at the agreement.  We have worked with Bill
Ward at Pruitt, Gushee, & Bachtel (PG&B) on this agreement (it is pretty
much our standard PSA), and he looks at all our agreements. I believe PG&B
has been approved by ENA.

The strategy here is that if we obtain the oil and gas rights, then we
believe we lock up the oil and gas leases covering the existing helium
rights owned by another entity. We are using this as leverage to get a
better deal from the helium rights owner.

As listed in Article 7.7, the acquisition wouldn't close until final
approval by members of Crescendo.  We are prepared to risk (and its not
really even at risk based on the termination provisions in Article 10)  the
$12,000 downpayment to work a deal with the helium rights owner.

Let's discuss ASAP.
Thanks, Ken

Thanks for the so called e-mail yesterday! Ha!  Actually, I will check again
when I get to work this morning.

Anyway, hope you got all your songs downloaded last night and got a good
nights sleep.  No more cramps for me last night.  I was very excited.

Have a great day at work and I will talk with you a little later!  Also, I
will find out what the definite plans are for Saturday night.  Like I said
last night, the whole little birthday party may never come around.  We may
have to be creative on our own!
Mark,  Attached is a draft of the CMS Letter Agreement.  Please review and

Mark,  I talked with Jeff Stone this morning concerning the petition.  The 
petition did not get filed on Friday as planned.  Jeff had left for 
Tallahassee prior to the FEDEX arriving on Friday morning.  They also wanted 
to have Katz-Kutter (our counsel in Fla.) sign the transmittal letter for the 
petition prior to sending.  This way the petition is sent by the customer and 
not the utility.  Bill Bryant at Katz-Kutter was unavailable Fri.  Jeff 
assured me that they will get this filed today.  I asked him to call me once 
filed.

We need to start thinking about the best way to approach WFEC after this 
petition is filed.  It sounds like Alabama Electric Cooperative is the way to 
approach this.  Do we know someone in our power trading group who works with 
AEC?   Might be useful to approach it through that relationship.
Ernie,  How is it going?  Did you have a good weekend?  I actually had to 
work for part of it, so my weekend wasn't all that great.

Were you able to book a room for me?  Wanted to be sure that was taken care 
of.

Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be getting into 
Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.  (281) 772-9250.  
If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why don't you just 
call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great, we'll ride 
over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been seeing with me.  My 
latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The wedding is at 7.

Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

Gerald,

Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same $129 rate.  Below
you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it matters which
one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.  They're both on
my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming from SA.  I
estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00 right?)  We'll
actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's family from the
Valley will be there as well.

If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting at the hotel
sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the wedding together 
from
there.

In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we got him a gift
yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

Andrew,  Attached is a rough draft of the CSA.  I am still reviewing the 
version, but it is substantially correct.  In the interest of time I am 
forwarding this for your review.  Please note Section 3.4.  I am a little 
concerned about this section from a retail wheeling standpoint.  I am trying 
to find local counsel in Pa to review this section.  Please review and lets 
discuss.
Mark,  Please review my attached change to the confirm.  This makes it clear 
that if we don't like their changes to the Master we will not accept them and 
the existing Master still governs.  If acceptable I will forward back to AEC.

Russell,  AEC is reviewing the Master and indicated they would have comments 
within a week or so.  The plan is now to execute this confirm and follow up 
with the new master.  The credit language that was in the earlier version has 
been removed.
I know.  It seems as though Mr. Rudy is in love, so damned the consequences!!

How are you doing?  Work treating you okay?  How is the law school 
application going?

My Dearest Barbara,   

I long for the time when I can gaze into your lovely golden brown eyes and 
lose myself in your innate beauty.  The sheer black leather rockies revealing 
your strong athletic form tonight will be a wonderful memory upon which I can 
call upon to see me through any of life's most challenging obstacles.  
Sigh!!!!!!!

I plan on leaving for the magical journey tonight as soon as humanly 
possible.  For who can think of work when one so lovely as Barbara awaits.  I 
can take journey upon my green Camry steed to pluck the lovely young Ms. 
Waldrop from those two known as Steve and Gina, and we will abound on towards 
fate.  Perchance it might be best for Barbara to come seek me out, as I am 
adrift without direction to the place where Steve and Gina reside.

Yours truly,
Gerald

Where is my "heartfelt and meaningful" e-mail?  I have been waiting all day!

So, what time are you planning on leaving work?  I am leaving here at 5:30
and heading over to Steve and Gina's to change and walk their dog.  I have
already taken Sophie over there.  That way I don't have to go home and then
come back all the way over here.  Do you want to come over to Steve and
Gina's or do you want me to come by and pick you up?

Hope you are having a good day.  Talk with you soon!
I am doing well.  Staying busy with work as usual.  Wow, your new job sounds 
like fun.  I wouldn't mind going to NYC once in a while.  I am around next 
week.  Maybe we could grab lunch or a happy later next week.  Let's talk 
early next week.

the new one executed.  Please review and if OK, I can prepare executables for

Very good.  I am very proud of your e-mail.  I was laughing but was very
impressed by it.  I think I should get those often.

How about I come by and pick you up this evening.  How does 7:00 sound?  Will
that be enough time for you to leave work and get home and change into your
leather Rockies?  By the way, I am not wearing those tonight.  I have decided
to break you into the cowboy scene slowly.  Instead, I will be wearing my
wranglers.  We will save the Rockies for when David is around!  I actually
believe that I will be wearing those Thursday night.  That way, you won't be
slapping me on the behind in the suite and trying to embarrass me.

Let me know about the time and I will see you this evening.

Hey Dena,  

Thanks for accompanying me to lunch today.  I really enjoyed our 
conversation.  You are very charming.  The rest of this week is pretty crazy 
and I am going to Austin for my friends wedding this weekend, but would you 
be interested in getting some dinner sometime next week?  Maybe Wed. or 
Thursday evening?   

GeraldThat's fine.  Actually I really need to catch up on my sleep and my Napster

Hey there!

I just got a call from some friends that I have not seen in a while and they
wanted to meet for dinner.  However, it won't be until 8:00 or after.
So...would you be upset if I changed my plans for tonight (actually, the
plans are not 100%, however, I did not want to call you at the last minute).
Hopefully you will see this as an opportunity for you to get some sleep.  If
all works out, I should be home by about 10 and if you are interested in
coming over then...you are more than welcome to!  Or..we can let the
excitement of seeing each other build up and let you have sweet dreams about
the leather Rockies.  Just kidding.  Anyway, let me know your thoughts.

Also, Casey came by my office today and expressed her apologies about burning
your face and wanted me to tell you how sorry she was.  I told her that the
skin should grow back in a few weeks.

Andrew,  Attached is the CSA.  I added some language in the HP-hour Charge 
section concerning the minimums.  I wasn't able to download the spreadsheet 
into the doc.  I think it needs to be formatted into word and my assistant is 
not here today.  We can just print out the excel file and attach for now.  
Let me know if you have any questions.
Did you ever receive these documents?  If so, I need the originals.

David,  Could you please review the following agreement.  Specifically 
Paragraph 11 which covers insurance.  ReUse will be providing ash handling 
services under this agreement.  This same agreement will be used for both  
Lumbertown Power, LLC and Elizabethtown Power, LLC.  These are the power 
plants in the Alamac transaction.  We are looking at replacing the existing 
Ash and Coal handling agreements with new ones.  Let me know if you have any

I have tentatively set up a 2:00 central time conference call with Bill

I will probably get to the casa about 9:00 pm.  Check out the attached.  Not 
sure if you heard, but K-State's President published a letter in which he 
called UT a bunch of wealthy arrogant Texans.  The attached is in response.

Gerald,

Please give me an update on the redrafting of the ReUse agreements.  I 
thought you told me that their attorneys were drafting, but from this e-mail 
I don't think Kris Johnson is aware of that.  Please follow up with their 
attorneys and let me know when to expect a new draft.

Regards,

Heather Kroll

Heather:

Please give me a quick update on the status of the Lumberton and
Elizabethtown coal and ash contracts from Enron's perspective.  Are we still
shooting for a March 15th closing date.  As of now I will out of town on the
15th, but reachable.

Thanks, hope all is going well.

Gerald,

I do apologize for not getting the comments away to you today as promised.
I have two items I have to confirm with the traders.  If I do not hear on
Monday morning I will flag the two items and forward the comments on the
rest of the agreement.

Have a good weekend!

AnnHi Dena,  Hope you had a good weekend.  I went to Austin for my friends 
wedding.  Got to see a lot of old friends that I haven't seen in a while, so 
that was cool.  Sounds like your pretty busy these days.  I can understand 
that with the transition moving forward.  Lunch would be great.  I am open 
later this week or early next week.  Let me know what you schedule looks 
like.

Gerald,

Jim Coffey and I met with Brian Redmond Thursday, March 1st to discuss 
20/20.  He has asked us to not spend any more time on this transaction and to 
concentrate on the sale of Houston Pipe Line until instructed otherwise or 
given further guidance related to 20/20.  During that meeting he left a 
message with Mark Witt and spoke with Brian Bierbach to discuss that the 
accounting support for the 20/20 transaction would soon not be as available.  
I am attaching a file where I have detailed out the issues as they related to 
Karry's spreadsheet for the detail of revenue and cost of sales 
transactions.  Below are the issues at a high level:

- The reversal of the June estimate.  ENA wrote off the receivable related to 
this.  Northern Border should include this amount in the calculation.  
Approximate value is $417,000.

- The O&M invoices with a date prior to July, 2000.  These are mostly Hanover 
invoices which Northern Border believes should be excluded.  The Hanover    
invoices were in the contract as included.  Approximate value is $527,000.

- The capital expenditure invoices with a date prior to July, 2000.  
Approximate value is $1,500,000.

Thanks,
Karen


Nick,  Attached is the form of services agreement.  The form is a little

Thanks.

Gerald - I am preparing the affidavit, and we would prefer if it is signed
by a business person, rather than a lawyer.  What was the name of the
business person in Denver who was on the conference call when we
were arranging this deal?  Would it be okay if he signed? Sorry I can't
remember his name.

How is your day going?  Generally manageable around here.  One of the 
assistants found out I used to be an Iron Maiden fan (technically, I still 
am)  and brought me an old Iron Maiden poster.  Boy is that going to look 
good in the house.  I know this is really impressing you.    

Talk at ya later,
G$Attached is the tasking letter based on the scope of work you provided.  
Please let me know if you have any questions.
The change if fine.  We also need to add the completion date for the services 
in  Part I Section 3.  I left it blank since I did not have that information.

I would include language which also obligates Calpine to take assignment of 
the Precedent Agreement with Kern and any associated firm transport contracts 
and to meet Kern's credit requirements in doing so.  I would propose the 
following in addition to the Guarantee language;

Calpine agrees to satisfy any requirements of Kern River and execute any and 
all documents as may be reasonably necessary to effectuate, as of the 
Closing, the permanent assignment/release  from Enron North America Corp. to 
Calpine of (i) that certain Precedent Agreement for Firm Transportation 
Service between Enron North America Corp. and Kern River dated _______, 2001 
(the "Precedent Agreement") and/or (ii) any firm transportation agreements 
entered into in accordance with the Precedent Agreement ((i) and (ii) 
collectively referred to as the "Kern Transport") such that Kern River (a) 
agrees to look solely to Calpine for all obligations with respect to the Kern 
Transport and (b) unconditionally releases ENA from all obligations for 
demand/reservation charges, and all other charges related to the Kern 
Transport.   

Obviously there is still the risk that if Calpine doesn't close or meet Kern 
River's credit requirements, then ENA is still left holding this contract.  
If you have any question, please contact me at (713) 853-3512.

Below is the covenant we have in the PSA regarding release of the gas credit 
support.  When will a shipper be required to put up the credit support?  
Would anticipate we would have trouble obtaining a written release from Kern 
if Calpine agreed to provide the required support?  Would we receive a 
written release if Enron puts up a guarantee (which by definition covers the 
entire 15-year term) and Calpine puts up a three year evegreen LC?  Thanks.

I am thinking that I will be here at least until 7 pm.  I will then run home

meet you at Little Woodrows by 8:00.  How does that work for your schedule?
What are you planning on doing after work!

ordered it before I left for my appt and then it had ben sitting here for

Dear Mr. (X) President:

I recently saw a bumper sticker that said, "Thank me, I voted for
Clinton-Gore."  So, I sat down and reflected on that and I am sending my
"Thank you" for what you have done, specifically:

1. Thank you for introducing us to Jennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, Monica
Lewinsky, Dolly Kyle Browning, Kathleen Willey, and Juanita Broaddrick.  Did

I leave anyone out?

2. Thank you for teaching my 8 year old about oral sex.  I had really
planned
to wait until he was about 10 or so to discuss it with him, but now he knows

more about it than I did as a senior in high school.

3. Thank you for showing us that sexual harassment in the work place
(especially the White House) and on the job is OK, and all you have to know
is what the meaning of  "IS" is.  It really is great to know that certain
 sexual acts are not sex and one person may have sex while the other one
involved does NOT have sex.  It's so unfortunate to see that the National
Organization of Women (NOW) has lost all credibility for  supporting you
throughout your escapades.

4. Thank you for reintroducing the concept of impeachment to a new
generation
and demonstrating that the ridiculous plot of the movie "Wag The Dog" could
be plausible after all.

5. Thanks for making Jimmy Carter look competent, Gerald Ford look graceful,

Richard Nixon look honest, Lyndon Johnson look truthful, and John Kennedy
look moral.

6. Thank you for the 72  witnesses testifying before the House and Senate
who
have pled the 5th Amendment and 17 witnesses who have fled the country to
avoid testifying about Democrat campaign fund raising.

7. Thank you for the 19 charges, 8 convictions, and 4 imprisonment's for the

Whitewater "mess" and the 55 criminal charges and 32 criminal convictions
(so far) in the other "Clinton" scandals.  No wonder it took you the entire
day of your last day in office to pardon them all.

8. Thanks also for reducing our military by half, "gutting" much of our
foreign policy, and flying all over the world on "vacations" carefully
disguised as necessary trips.  Please give my regards to Hillary, when/if
 you see her.  Tell her I'm working on a "Thank You" letter for her also.

9. Thank you, also, for "finding" millions of dollars of excess tax money. I

really didn't need it in the first place and I can't think of a more well
deserving group of recipients for my hard-earned dollars than jet fuel and
security for all of your globetrotting. I understand you; the family, and
your cronies have logged in more time aboard Air Force One than any other
administration.

10. Thank you for closing so many millions of acres of 'public'  lands
 without the input of the people and governing officials living in  the
states affected.

11.  Thank you for pardoning some 140 citizens who have been  convicted of
breaking the law, some of whom gave you hundreds of thousands of dollars to
your political campaigns.

12. Thank you for an attorney general that saw fit to protect you and your
'constituents' from embarrassment or prosecution.

God bless America and THANK YOU for redefining the integrity and character
of the highest office in the land.

Sincerely,
U.S. Citizen

P.S. Please pass along a special thank you to Al Gore for "inventing' the
Internet and making the distribution of this letter possible.

Attached is the information of Barbara's friend. Happy hunting.  I give you a 
call later about Satellite.

Subject: 20/20 Update

I spoke with Karry regarding the outstanding issues related to 20/20.   He 
said that the items that were on item B on my issues schedule for Natural Gas 
Revenues for $989k were ENA paying Northern Border.  The $309k in item F were 
Northern Border paying ENA.  This would change the post closing adjustment by 
a net of about $680k.  I will work through the new calculation with the items 
identified.

Also, he said that he thought ENA's Gas accounting group, Scott Sitter and 
someone from Denver should meet to go through the adjustments and payments 
that have gone through since the closing.  This could affect the post closing 
calculation with fairly significant dollars and would be information that I 
would not have.  

Cris - I am attaching a schedule that I believe Karry used to get to the 
basis for the initial gain calculation.  It is on the tab "P&S Combined".

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Karen

Gerald, What is the status of this Master?

Thanks

Brant,  Attached is clean and redlined copy of the revised Credit Services 
Agreement with Bridgeline.  I made significant revisions to this document.  
In general the document was very thin and needed to be reinforced to provide 
a more detailed deal arrangement.  Please review  and if credit is OK, I am 
fine to send this to Bridgeline.  

Please note that I did leave an open question on the fee structure.  The 
agreement currently provides for a flat fee of $10,000 per month for the 
services.  Do we need to be reimburse for any third party expenses to perform 
the services or would all services be internal and included in the flat fee?  
Need to establish this before we send out to Bridgeline.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.
You are so cool.  I can't believe that the person in that picture with the 
biggest rock band of all time, was in my bed last night.  Wow!  Everyday I 
found something out that just makes me want you more and more!  Ha Ha Ha

How is Ms. Barbara doing today?  I am weary from the pile of other people's 
projects couched on top of my head but "I will survive, Hey Hey".  I've lost 
the edge Maverick,  I am holding on too tight!
Attached are the revised drafts. 

Please note the following:

1.  I revised the FERC language but haven't yet talked to Drew about this 
concept.  He is in Houston somewhere and I have a call in to him.

2.  The Equivalent HP concept was removed.  Thus a Force Majeure or Utility 
interruption event will interuppt the Compression Services Charge.

3.  Please review the unwind language carefully in the Conversion Agreement.

4.  I added an arbitration provision.  This is standard in ENA or affiliate 
contracts.

The O&M form will follow shortly.

In case you are not on your work email.

 - barbara and quiet riot.jpgJean,  FYI, I have faxed the executed CA back to Entergy concerning Highland 
Energy.  They should be good to move forward with discussion.  Let me know if 
you need anything else.

  I forwarded your picture to Eric and your little comment about you wanting to 
join Quiet Riot has sent shockwaves through the members of Monkey Pump.  
First of all,  you haven't even been voted into the band yet (seems the 
chances are getting less likely with you already shopping your skills on the 
market) and now you already discussing new ventures.  Secondly, Monkey Pump 
is not a stepping stone.  We are big time and those has beens "Quiet Riot" 
will wish for just a small portion of our fame and fortune.  

I guess this does add a new dimension to the much anticipated VH-1 Behind the 
Music: Monkey Pump episode.  

"Monkey Pump was on its way, they were only 5 years away from their first 
album, but little did they know that the person who they weren't even really 
sure they wanted to be their lead singer, already had other designs on 
reviving a heavy metal icon from long ago.  When we return on behind the 
music............"

Eric and I will discuss this and get back with you.  In the meantime we had 
better not see you at any photo ops with Poison or Warrant.Mark,  Attached is the letter agreement we discussed.  Please review.  It is 
rough.    



Some issues to note:

1.  The Kern PA cannot be assigned without their consent, which shall not be 
unreasonably withheld.  If Kern didn't like the fact that we are receiving 
assignment from 3 or 4 other shippers, they might withhold consent if they 
thought we were superceding their bid procedures.  Not sure if they would, 
but it is a risk.

2.  If the assignment is done after the producer executes the firm transport 
agreement, Kern could require to capacity to be released via capacity release 
at max rate.  

3.  I took a stab at the mark-to-market calculation.  Probably needs more 
substance though.

=09=09 cc:=20
=09=09 Subject: California Energy Crisis

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state. Attached for your review is a draft letter for third parties whom with we 
plan to participate in the Kern River Open Season.  Barry asked that I 
forward to you as well for review.

Lets discuss.Per Steve's request, I am forwarding a phone number of a consulting company 
that produces maps which show all pipeline in Texas (sorted by county).  This 
might be a good place to start to find the pipeline you described in your

level.

Attached is a rough draft of the O&M Agreement
Tyrell,  I have made some revisions to the latest drafts of  the letter 
agreement and your cover letter.  Please review.  As I noted earlier, Barry 
indicated he had some language that he wanted to revise concerning the mark 
to market.  I have not been able to contact him yet.  So unless Mark and 
Barry have talked, probably need to hold these until you or I hear from Barry.



Also, if we are going to do any of these transaction with a Canadian party, 
Peter Keohane and Eric Ledain need to comment on this form.  I have sent them 
an earlier version and I am copying them here.  

I will be in a meeting until about 3:30 pm central and will be available 
after that.  

I again want to reiterate, that if the assignment takes place after the firm 
transport agreements are signed, Kern could require the assignment to be done 
via the capacity release bidding procedures of their tariff.  I noticed that 
one of the packages is less than 1 year in term.  This means it could also be 
bid up in excess of max rate.  Anything over 1 year could only be bid to max 
rate.    We may want to add a provision that to the extent the capacity is 
assigned via capacity release and it is bid up beyond max rate, ENA will have 
no obilgation to take the capacity and make the mark to market payment.   
Probably need to discuss this with Mark.

this morning????  Yep, you guessed it Deblah Morgan.  She is actually a
really young singer and she is more on the Hip Hop side of the music
business.  Anyway, I actually would have never known who she was unless
someone had told me.

So, what are you thinking about tonight.  Do you want to see if Eric and Jenn
and David and whoever else want to meet downtown at Salintes?

Also, were you being serious about China?  I really would consider it, but I
need to get more details about dates, etc.  I actually think that would be so
much fun.  Now you're sitting there saying, "crap, why did I bring that
up...I was just kidding around!"

John,  Attached is the Transco guaranty with further revisions.  The 
following items of note were revised.

1.  Transco added language stating that this is a performance guaranty.  
Enron will only provide a payment guaranty.  Enron does not have the means to 
ensure performance by the LLC.  Thus the language needs to clearly identify 
that this is a payment guaranty.  As long as Transco gets paid for the 
transport, I am not sure why this matters.

2.  Transco would be able to collect interest for late payments under their 
tariff.  Putting late payment interest in the guaranty would give Transco the 
ability to recover double interest on late payments.  Thus, the interest 
language in the guaranty was removed.  

Please review the revised guaranty.  I would be happy to discuss these issues 
with Transco's attorney's at their convenience.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

1.  Kern River Expansion Bid - Executed approximately 6 agreements with 
producers to partcipate in Kern River's Open Season.  Producers were required 
to bid in Open Season and upon award of capacity by Kern, the producers will 
assign such capacity to ENA in exchange for 25% of ENA mark to market profit 
on the capacity.  Overall objective of the project was to increase ENA 
capacity stake on this expansion.  The basis is currently very profitable 
between Wyoming and California.  Worked with Barry Tycholiz and Mark Whitt

2.  Enron Compression Services - StageCoach  - Negotiating a deal to provide 
HP Compression Services to Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company in Pennsylvania.  
Drafts have been sent to Tennessee.  Also negotiating a power and gas deal 
with EES to provide electric service to the compressor and sell the gas to 
EES which ECS receives from Tennessee.

Gerald,

Here is the first credit worksheet for terms to the draft Reliant contract.  
Once you prepare the draft, e-mail it to me, and I will forward it to BGML.  
After that, we can get the contact and address information to formally pursue 
a negotiation.

Debra,  This is another one for a Master Firm/Purchase Sale.  The Enron

Andrew,  Attached is a draft of the Master Firm/Purchase between EES and ECS 
and its accompany Transaction Agreement.  I think it does make sense to have 
a separate agreement to encompass the overall annual true between the power 
and gas sides.  Need to discuss this with EES' attorney.  I will contact Bo 
and see who is the lead attorney on this deal.   Please review the attached 
documents and let me know before you send this to EES.  As you will see I 
have a few question noted on the TA.



How is it going?  I didn't get here until about 9:20.  Yikes.  I had 6 
voicemail messages, when I got here.  Help.


Bo,  Attached is the draft of the gas agreement for the StageCoach 
transaction.  There are still a few blanks for which Andrew is getting the 
information.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.



Also to follow up on our discussion from earlier concerning who would 
actually contracts with the PPL for the Utility Agreement;  we had earlier 
discussed Tennessee Gas Pipeline contracting with the Utility with EES acting 
as their agent for interaction with the Utility.  However, I think it should 
be EES who contracts with the Utility to receive electric service.  TGP has 
contracted with ECS for Compression Services and ECS has contracted with EES 
for power.  TGP has no need for a power deal.  Let me know what you think 
about this.

It is my understanding that EES is working on a revised draft of the TA for 
the Power Contract.  Let me know if this is not correct.  Thanks.
Dan,  Per our discussion, attached is the Compressor Services Agreement 
between Enron Compression Services Company  and Tennessee Gas Pipeline 
Company.  This is a rough draft at this point, but should give you a good 
idea of the structure of this deal.  Note that Section 3.4 will be removed as 
this is no longer part of the deal.


Ken,  I am forwarding the initialed cover letter with the changes included.  
Please revise the body of the proposal to also reflect the changes made to 
the cover sheet.  Let me know if you have any questions.

???????  
??????? As we discussed, outlined below is a sentence that Transco proposes 
to insert to replace the language stricken by Enron at the end of Paragraph 2 
of the Guaranty to address Enron's concerns about over-collecting interest 
for late payments:

??????? "If Guarantor fails to make timely payment of the amount of the 
Payment Demand, then Counterparty shall be entitled to collect the amount of 
the Payment Demand together with interest calculated in accordance with 
Section 7(c) of the General Terms and Conditions of Counterparty's FERC Gas 
Tariff as amended from time-to-time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
Counterparty shall not be entitled to collect such interest, to the extent 
such interest has already been assessed due to Company's failure to pay any 
Obligations which are the subject of the Payment Demand.

??????? Please call me at (713) 215-2810 to discuss Transco's revised 
language.? We look forward to finalizing the Guaranty today if possible.? 
Thanks for your cooperation.? Gnny Levenback

Some thoughts that might help from time to time.  This was forwarded to me, 
and I found it very compelling.

Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one 
so 
that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful 
for that gift. When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often 
times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has 

been opened for us. The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a 
porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it 
was the best conversation you've ever had. It's true that we don't know what 

we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've 

been missing until it arrives. Giving someone all your love is never an 
assurance that they'll love you back! Don't expect love in return; just wait 

for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in 
yours. 
It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, 
and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. Don't 
go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. 
Go 
for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark 

day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile. There are moments 

in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from 
your dreams and hug them for real! Dream what you want to dream; go where 
you 
want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one 
chance to do all the things you want to do. May you have enough happiness to 

make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you 
human, enough hope to make you happy. Always put yourself in others' shoes. 
If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too. The 
happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just 
make the most of everything that comes along their way. Happiness lies for 
those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have 
tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have 
touched 
their lives. Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a 
tear. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you 
can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and 
heartaches. When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was 
smiling. Live your life so that when you die, you're the one who is smiling 
and everyone around you is crying. Please send this message to those people 
who mean something to you, to those who have touched your life in one way or 

another, to those who make you smile when you really need it, to those that 
make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down, to those 
who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship. And if 
you don't, don't worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just miss 
out on the opportunity to brighten someone's day with this message. 








Could you print these out for me.  Thanks.

Congratulations!!  

On behalf of all of the Asset Group I would like to extend our appreciation 
and congratulations for making Hanover Measurement Services (HMS) a reality.  
A year of creative effort and determination, has transformed the project from 
the sale/leaseback of HPL's metering equipment into a viable measurement 
services company.    HMS provides the opportunity to reduce HPL's operating 
costs and leverage Enron's technical expertise to provide measurement 
services to third party customers.   

This project is an example of how the Asset Group must leverage our resources 
and existing assets to create sustainable, recurring earnings in the years 
ahead.  Each of you contributed to this success and your efforts are greatly 
appreciated by HPL and senior Enron management.  Our task now is to expand  
HMS' customer base and position the company to take advantage of emerging 
measurement, communications and systems technology.

Again, congratulations on establishing and financing HMS, and please share 
our appreciation with team members who assisted you in this success.

Regards,
Brian

Heather,  Attached is the ash handling agreement with revisions.  Please

Heather,  Attached are redlines of both the Coal Handling Agreement and the 
Ash Handling Agreement with revisions.  I made a few further changes to the 
Ash Handling Agreement in the Indemnity Section.  Please review and let me 
know if you have any questions.  Both docs do have a few questions inserted 
where I wasn't sure if the language accurately reflected our deal.  Sorry for 
the delay.
Thanks for the review.  A more formal response is not necessary at this

Dan,  Per our discussion, attached is the Compressor Services Agreement
between Enron Compression Services Company  and Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Company.  This is a rough draft at this point, but should give you a good
idea of the structure of this deal.  Note that Section 3.4 will be removed
as this is no longer part of the deal.

Hey Ernie!  Sorry I didn't get back with you Friday.  I left a little early, 
so I must have just missed your message.  Did you guys have a good time on 
Friday night?  How is everything going?

It has actually been thick around here.  Worked several late nights last week 
to try and get caught up.  I may have to delay the purchase of the new car 
with Enron's stock taking a hit lately.  It did gain some points on Friday 
and early today.  Hopefully it keeps it up.

Talked to George since his wedding?  Haven't heard anything out of him 
since.  Probably just overcome by marital bliss.

 Hey, what's going on?  My brother-in-law and a friend of his are
flying into town tonight?  We're going to head over to Gilians (sp?), a
place that is supposed to be like Dave & Buster's.  We'll prob get there at
about 10:00.  We thought we'd hang there for a while and then head to the
downtown area and find dome kind of bar.  A couple of other friends of mine
from  B-school will be joining us, I thought you might want to as well.  Are
you game?

 Write back or give me a call H: 281-251-6398, cell: 281-687-6893.
I'm leaving work in a few minutes if I don't respond to any email.

 Ernie,  Thanks for taking care of that.   I will probably be getting
into
 Austin earlier than you.  I'll have my cell phone with me.  (281)

 If you get into town earlier, give me a call.  Otherwise why don't
you just
 call me at the room when you get to the hotel.   Sounds great, we'll
ride
 over together.  I might bring this girl I have kinda been seeing
with me.
 My latest victim.  We'll see.    I believe that's correct.  The
wedding is
 at 7.

 Thanks for the Dilliards tip.  I was going to ask about that.

Hotel Room Confirmation








 Gerald,

 Good news - we were able to get the second room at the same $129
rate.
 Below
 you'll see two separate confirmation numbers - I don't think it
matters
 which
 one you or I use.  When you check in, just claim one of them.
They're both
 on
 my card so you can transfer to yours at check-in.

 I'm not sure what time we'll get there since we'll be coming from
SA.  I
 estimate we'll get there at about 5:00 (the wedding is at 7:00
right?)
 We'll
 actually be traveling to SA on Friday since some of Jill's family
from the
 Valley will be there as well.

 If we're not in contact before then, let's just plan on meeting at
the
 hotel
 sometime between 6:00 and 6:30.  We can drive over to the wedding
together
 from
 there.

 In case you didn't know, they're registered at Dillard's - we got
him a
 gift
 yesterday, still plenty of items on the list.

How was the big weekend in Vegas?  I usually don't have to much luck at 
gambling but I like to do it nonetheless.  Did you win any money on the 
fight?  I had a blast the last time I went.  We stayed at the Paris hotel.  
Very nice.  All those hotel employees saying "Bon Jeur" every 5 minutes did 
get a little tiring though.Stephanie,  Attached is the form for the Hunt to Misako assignment.
Attached is clean and redlined version of the Misako letter agreement with 
revisions.  Please review and if ok have Misako execute.  
Please see attached.  I added an agreement by Hunt to assign their PA to 
Misako.
Brant,  Attached are the Master Firm agreement that Debra prepared based on 
your credit worksheet.  I removed the form of Guaranty since we use a 
different form for the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.   and I wasn't sure if we 
would need a JV guaranty for any of these deals.  

Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
I'll be there at 7:00.  Barbara is planning on going, but will probably be 
late.  Around 8:00.  She likely just meet us for drinks.  Is that a problem?

How is it going?  Did you survive the honeymoon?  Clement,  Attached is the Enron Corp. guaranty for Transco's transportation 
agreement.  We revised the interest language to make it clear we are not 
subject to double interest and put in a limited performance guaranty for the

unfortunately we were thinking of moving the dinner to this Thursday.  I
really hope that still works for you guys.  I don't think Ryan knows you
guys are coming, but had indicated a while ago how fun it would be to have
dinner with everyone...so I was still going to try and keep it a surprise.
Please let me know if that's still okay so I can change the reservation.

Thanks.

What's going on dude? Antigua was awesome. I survived it without a problem.
Heather moving in has been a different story. I didn't realize how much
"stuff" you could pack into a one bedroom apartment. How is your love life.
The gal from the wedding was pretty hot. Are you still chasing that? Lets
get together soon. Our extra bedroom is nicer now. My old bed got tossed in
a dumpster. It smelled like shit.

Russell,  I reviewed this with our business guys and they were fine with what 
you represent here.  We did not check this with Tom Balcerowiz and he needs 
to take a look at it.  Have your technical people gotten with Tom yet on any 
of these issues?  If not then we can run it down on this end.  

Our only concern was that reliability between Gulf's 230 kv system and AEC's 
115 kv system was not addressed.  It was our understanding that this was a 
question of the PSC staff.  Are there plans to provide any information 
concerning this item, or is no information available from AEC for such 
assessment?

Any word concerning WFEC's response to our petition or any filings they have 
made with the PSC?

current version and specifically any credit revisions that are necessary.  
The old master was only set up for 6 month or less term deals with volumes of 
15,000 MMBtu or less.

On or about September 23, 1999 a request for service was placed by the above 
referenced counterparty.  The request was for a Intrastate Gas Transportation 
Agreement and 311 Gas Transportation Agreement.  These agreements were 
forwarded to the counterparty, CCNG, Inc..  On or about October 6, 1999,  
Kelly Cloud, Senior Vice President of CCNG, Inc. (713) 235-1972, called and 
informed me that the counterparty should be CCGM, L.P..  Further, she 
informed me that Section 7 of the agreement, which reads  in part: Gas is 
free from liens and adverse claims of every kind, should be changed because 
the gas that the counterparty will be transporting on HPL may and/or  is 
subject to liens.  She was instructed to destroy the agreement and another 
would be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and re-wording of 
Section 7.

Attached find the agreements for the necessary changes in Section 7.  Kelly 
Cloud has instructed me to call with any further questions.

Barry,  Attached is a draft of the confirm for the Sierra Deal.  This confirm 
reflect only the volumes related to Package Two.  The confirm for package one 
would be indentical to this one with term and volumes revised.  As we 
discussed this confirm, does not reflect the revisions needed to the existing 
master.  Please review and let's discuss.
Debra,  Darren Should be sending you two credit tickets for these entities.

Gerald, I have discussed the papering of this transaction with SPPC and NPC 
and we will proceed with the raising of a Master Firm agreement between ENA 
and each of these co's. 

This specific sale will be papered under Nevada Power Co. so let's proceed 
with that paper being the lead.

I will review the confirm you sent, but re-issue under the premise that the 
confirm is being raised to the new master. 

Thanks.  BT Barry,  Attached are the Master Firm agreement for both Sierra Pacific and 
Nevada.  If you are OK with these, we can foward to them for their review.  
As soon you provide any comments on the Transaction Agreement, I can finalize 
them under the Nevada Power master agreement.

The information was sent to the FPSC staff on Tuesday, March 27, 2000.  Tom
did review the document prior to it being sent to the FPSC.  Gulf added a
small paragraph regarding the outages experienced on our 230kV system.  We
do not have access to AEC's information.  Thus, far we have seen no filings
from AEC or WFEC.

Hello, Cheryl

I would like to better understand the issues before we make any decisions.
Can you please provide us with the details of this issue.  What is the call
sign of the HPL Licenses that we are talking about?  What type of equipment
are we talking about? (i.e. MW,  MAS, and/or Conventional Radio)  What
personnel or group is the equipment supporting?  What are the full list of
compliance issues on this?

Ryan Terry is with an external firm providing services to AEP and Enron in
assisting in filing of the necessary "Transfer of Control" Documents with
the FCC.   Depending on what the issues are Ryan and his firm may provide
counsel concerning this matter, but the decision to remedy these issues
and/or to cancel the license and remove the equipment will need to be made
by AEP, Enron and HPL personnel.

Issue





Hello, Ryan.  I got your e-mail address from Kevin Dumas.  I want to
discuss with you an issue we have at a tower lease site.  HPL is currently
leasing tower space from REB Communications in Gilmer, Texas.  Our
operator, HMS, discovered this week that the tower was not in compliance
with FCC regulations.  The most critical issue is that the tower lights do
not appear to be functional.  HMS has recommended that HPL remove it's
equipment from the tower and  cancel our FCC license immediately.

I would like to protect the interests of both HPL and AEP, and I would
appreciate your suggestion on what to do with the equipment licence.  I do
not want to do anything to jeopardize the closing of the HPL sale.  Please
call me at 713.853.6250, or e-mail me at cheryl.marshall@enron.com, so we
can discuss this issue.

		 Subject: Clarification On Tower Issue

I spoke with Jason Griffith with AEP this evening, and I want to clarify my 
previous e-mail message.  The operation/business issues that we have at the 
Gilmer tower are under control.  The tower has problems with its lighting 
system, and it does not have its FAA license posted.  As lessee, HPL did not 
want to be exposed to the potential fines that the FAA/FCC could levy against 
the tower owner.  

This tower supports one person, and is not a part of our critical data path.  
My concern and reason for sending the prior e-mail revolved around the FCC 
licenses associated with the HPL owned equipment on this tower.  My knowledge 
about FCC licenses is minimal, and I wanted to ensure that removing the 
equipment from this tower would not jeopardize the transfer of the licences 
from Enron to AEP.  It is my understanding that the current operational 
situation at the Gilmer tower will not effect the transfer of the licences 
that are specific to this tower.  Please let me know if this is not the 
case.  Feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Cheryl Marshall

the reference to Paragraph 6 in both Paragraphs 8 and 9.

Let me know if you have any questions.
Per your notes.

Barbara, The attached doc. contains a comparison of Houston Law Firm pay for 
associates.  This chart has the base salary only without any bonuses 
included.  I pulled this from FindLaw.com.  Let me know if you have any 
questions or want to discuss.
Eggcellent!!!  Yes, I did have your watch.  However, due to lean times on the 
Nemec ranch, I was forced to see what the cash equivalent of your watch would 
be.  Does $10 sound fair.  Anyway I took the ten bucks, which thankfully 
acounted for both my beers last night.   Chalk up another one to the Nemec 
leisure activity fund.

Thanks

Okay, we have decided to have an EASTER EGG decorating contest! 
You decorate your own egg - don't go buy a decorated one! 
Judging will be at the BBQ & prizes will be won ... 1st, 2nd and 3rd place 
honors! 

So, be creative!

Attached is a rough draft of the pricing letter for Kennedy Oil on the excess 
gas volumes.  Please review and add the relevant pricing structure.  Let me 
know if you have any questions.
How bout them Horns? Give me a call when you get a chance.Jenn,  Here is Jeff and Cathy's flight info.  Mine and Babs are the same 
except for the first legs to Tokyo.  We go from Houston to Minneapolis to the 
city the Godzilla destroyed.  I.e. Tokyo.  Then we catch the same flights 
from Tokyo to Shanghai.  We have the same return flights.

Attached are the contracts for the Kennedy and Quantum excess gas purchase.  
The confirms will be signed by the parties and governed by the GTC.  The 
attached GTC is the same for both confirms.  Note the Exhibit A to each 
confirm is not attached.  I will simply take the well listing Exhibit's from 
the existing long term contracts to create these new exhibits.
I want to move to the new garage.  Let me know what I need to do. Thanks.

		 Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)










We lightened the tone significantly.  Let's discuss.
Please replace the prior version with these.  I added some Wyoming Royalty 
Statute language in both confirms.  Let me know if you have any questions.
Ken,  I have read through the agreement.  I think this agreement need some 
fairly significant revisions.  It is extremely one-sided as currently 
written.  I will write up my comments and get those to you early next week.

Gerald,

Have you had a chance to look at the Compressor Rental Agreement for the
Badger Wash Gas Plant?

Ken Krisa


Ozzie,  Steve Van Hooser forwarded two agreement for electric service from 
CP&L for the Elizabethtown and the Lumbertown cogen facilities for my 
review.  I have reviewed the documents and they are standard tariff type 
service agreements.  There are two items to which I would like to draw your 
attention.  These deals look to have a 10 year term since they are being 
served from Transmission Service.  

1.  If Customer terminate earlier, there would be a termination payment equal 
to the loss in salvage value of the facilities used to serve the Customer.  
Not sure what this value is, but might be significant, depending on what 
facilities CP&L would install to serve these plants.

2.  There is a minimum bill each month that Customer would have to pay, even 
if there was no usage of power by Customer.

If you are OK with these issues, I will initial the agreements and forward 
these  to you for signature. 

Please contact me at x33512 if you would like to discuss.


Barry,  Attached is the form of assignment that we can use for assignment of 
all the Transportation Agreement to ENA.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Subject: NTSB Findings

The National Transportation Safety Board recently divulged a highly secret
plan they had funded with the U.S. auto makers for the past five-years. The
NTSB covertly funded a project whereby the auto makers were installing
black boxes in four wheel drive pick-up trucks in an effort to determine, in
fatal accidents, the circumstances in the last 15 seconds before the crash.

They were surprised to find in 49 of the 50 states the last words of
drivers in 61.2% of fatal crashes were, "Oh, Sh*t!" Only the state of Texas 
was
different, where 89.3% of the final words were, "Hey Y'all, watch this!"
Darren,  Per our discussion, attached are the confirms for the Nevada Power 
transaction for the Firm GTC in lieu of the master.  After review, lets 
discuss the credit provisions we need to insert into the GTC.
Barry,  Attached is the GTC form without any revisions for any credit 
language.  Darren will be getting back with me shortly on the credit issues.
Julie is checking with Kern and the modification to their assignment 
agreement and whether they will prepare the assignments.  If I am to prepare 
the assignments I will need the Transportation Service Agreement information 
(volume, contract #, contract date)  for each shipper.

		 Subject: China Itinerary

Mom & Dad,

First off, what day do you guys fly out to Shanghai?  Is it the 5th or the 
6th? (i.e. send me your flight info!)

Attached is Jenn and I's flight itinerary for the China Trip (see forwarded 
msg below).  Gerald & Barbara, Dan, Gayle & Heather are also on the same 
flight going over.  We changed from the original Shanghai round-trip plan to 
save some money and avoided some logistic issues.....we are now flying into 
Shanghai a little earlier and leaving from Beijing instead of 
Shanghai............this allows us to avoid any domestic airline flights (a 
good thing) as that can be expensive and makes the trip a little less hectic 
in the beginning...so here's the tentative plan:

June 4th - Depart for China
June 5th - Arrive in Shanghai (Jon can you meet us in Shanghai on this day?)
June 6 & 7 sightseeing in Shanghai, June 7th Evening - take night train to 
Chingdao (if there is one)
 - Meet up with Rodger & Sandy, et al., either in Shanghai or in Chingdao.
June 8th - Depart/Arrive in Chingdao
June 9th - Wedding Bliss & related activities.
June 10th - Sightseeing in Chingdao
June 11th - Depart for Beijing on Train 
 (tentative departure date, we may want to stay around/see stuff in the 
area/or something else on the way there, etc.?)
June 12th - June 15th: Beijing (Sightseeing, day trips, etc.)
June 16th - Depart from Beijing to Houston (Eric & Jenn, Gerald & Barbara.)  
 Dan, Gayle & Heather are staying for another week in China, and I believe my 
parents are staying another 3 or 4 days as well?

Jeff and Cathy are possibly going to switch their flight as well in order to 
do this schedule.  This is of course a tentative/rough draft itinerary, & 
nothing is set but our plane tickets.  

Jon & Dan: I believe we are all looking to you guys to help us determine 
exactly what we should look at and more importantly what we should and should 
not eat.

Tiger penis soup anyone?!.........Looking forward to it,

Hey kids:

Greetings from Wuxi. The wedding preparations continue as planned. Just got 
back from another planning mission to Qingdao last weekend. We put deposits 
down on hotel rooms, restaurant and finalized the plans with the local 
Christian church. We were lucky to obtain the services of a very courteous, 
English speaking pastor named Mr. Dong. Mr. Dong will translate the ceremony 
into our native tongue for all big noses present.

I'm writing to you now to get your hotel reservations for your stay in 
Qingdao. We've put down a 2000 yuan deposit, but we must now secure exact 
lodging dates. Would you all please respond asap with the dates that you'll 
be staying in Qingdao? Everyone will stay at the Qingdao Dong Hai "East 
Ocean" Hotel. Most of you will probably be arriving in Qingdao on June 7th. 
The wedding is on the morning of the 9th. Do people want to stay an extra day 
after the wedding, or do they want to leave on the 10th after the wedding? 
Give me your plans and I'll fax them to the hotel management this week.

The big banquet dinner will not be immediately after the wedding ceremony. We 
couldn't find a suitable restaurant that wasn't already booked. We've moved 
the big wedding feast from noon to the evening of the wedding day. It will be 
at a famous Shandong style seafood restaurant. This restaurant has 
everything: snakes, frogs, scorpions, caterpillars, exotic marine birds, 
about 15 kinds of shellfish, and just about everything else you could imagine 
putting in your mouth that comes from the ocean, plus some things that you 
wouldn't normally imagine putting in your mouth from the ocean. It's kind of 
like going to Sea World and then pointing to a fish in the tank and telling 
someone how you'd like it cooked, except you'll be surrounded by a billion 
drunken Chinese tourists who will all be swilling ridiculous amounts of rice 
liquor and screaming, "Down with American Imperialism!" and "The East is Red- 
Long Live Chairman Mao!" Sounds great, eh?

So- please, tell me your planned arrival and departure dates to and from 
Qingdao so we can finish this monkey business with the hotel folks. Hope all 
is swell with everyone. I'll be in touch again soon. Adios.

Cheers,

Jon Gillaspie

Notes:

Ma & Pa- please get this info from the Staters and the Aines.

Eric- pass this on to Jennifer so we can get this info from Dan and Gail Junk.

Hi Gerald,

We're still alive and kicking.  I made some changes to the LOI.  Can you 
check it over - I'm hoping to send it over to Corey at the end of the week.

Thanks,

Tyrell,  I Kern won't accept changes, then we can insert into Patina letter 
amended a clause which states the ENA will keep whole Patina for those 
obligations and liabilities.

I agree . . . if Kern remains stubborn, is there any short, sweet side 
agreement that could be drafted between ENA and Patina (maybe as an add-on to 
our letter agreement amendment) that would effectively pass through the 
pre-assignment liabilities?

I just received Chris Kennedy's marked up version.  I will forward 
immediately.

You can direct Kern that we are prepared to underpin that exposure such that 
Enron wears that risk.... as
 1. there should be no risk anyways, and 
2.  if there were to be any, it should be ENA's anyways.

Daddy-o:

If you want I can recommend some hotels we stay in. If you're traveling with 
Dan and Gayle you probably won't be searching out the cheap, flea-bag, opium 
stalls that I frequent. Shanghai has oodles of hotels. If you browse through 
a China "Lonely Planet" travel book you'll see a breakdown of the various 
hotels based on prices and accommodations. If you're pinching pennies we can 
get you decent rooms at a new hotel for about 400 yuan ($50 USD), but the 
joint is no where near the Bund (waterfront). Shanghai ain't cheap.

Ai Ping will most likely be in Qingdao doing wedding preparations when you 
arrive in Shanghai. I don't know exactly what my work schedule will be like, 
but I'll be there to meet you. In regards to the Shanghai>Qingdao flight, 
we'll try and book for everybody. I don't think we'll need your credit card 
info. I'm hoping we can arrange for all of you to just pay in the airport 
when you get there (ie. we'll reserve it).

The itinerary below looks fine. I'd take the morning flight to Qingdao on 
June 8th. That way you can get settled in your rooms, hit the beaches, stroll 
the streets, drink fresh Qingdao beer, and familiarize yourselves with the 
city. June 9th is the big day.

June 10th you can hang out for another day in this coastal city, or move 
north to Beijing. I'd say spend the extra day in Qingdao and relax a little 
bit before entering the tourist madness that is Beijing in June. You'll need 
a day to rest after the wedding because you'll be expected to consume about 
three vats of rice liquor at the wedding banquet eating extravaganza. I shit 
you not- this will get ugly. You'll be expected to go native and vomit on 
your wife. I'm fuggin serious! Every fat-assed, 60-something, sausage-eating, 
big-nosed, camera-toting Western devil ever born in the history of the planet 
will accompany you on your trip through the Forbidden City in Beijing. Bring 
lots of benevolence and Buddha-like patience or bring lots of heavy weaponry.

The only pre-wedding activities will be a group dinner somewhere and a night 
at my French buddy's pub on June 8th. We'll probably eat at a shithole 
reataurant downtown that serves the wickedest squid bbq in the Eastern 
hemisphere. You won't be expected to assist in any way other than making 
yourself extremely groovy. We could also arrange a group boat ride on the 
ocean to a couple surrounding islands. Qingdao itself translates into "Green 
Island." But, as you know, it's not an island, it's just surrounded by 
several.

Yep, I'm now nearing freak out mode. In a way I've just got to do what I do 
best: be a stupid foreigner and stay out of the Shang family's way. It's Ai 
Ping's wedding in Ai Ping's motherland- I'm just here to be me and play the 
role of the goofy Western monkey who marries the Chinese princess. Please 
god, mail me some dope.

Write again soon. Looking forward to the chaos....

Hugs and booty-smooches all around,

Jon

you are probably very busy with conference calls. Anyway, I look forward to
working in your department this summer. I have already taken my drug test,
and have given Molly Magee my start dates (tentatively with your approval).
I have my start date scheduled to commence on May 21, 2001 and end on June
29, 2001. I hope these dates coincide with your schedule. Please e-mail me
and let me know.

Looking Forward to this summer,

Majed Nachawati

working
for the 1st half of the summer. I called your residence earlier today,
but
your machine did not pick up.    It is probably easier to communicate
via

Jordan,  Attached is the latest structure.  This is still subject to change 
as AA has not yet approved.  The deal basically involves creating a new 
entity to take ownership of 2 existing Electric Compressor Motor Drivers and 
associated contracts which ECT currently owns.  The compressor motor drivers 
are supplied with electricity from the Navajo Tribal Utiltity Authority 
(NTUA).  ECT sells horsepower created by the motor drivers to Transwestern in 
exchange for $$ and MMBtus.  

Lance Schuler will be working the finance portion of this project.  This is a 
2nd Quarter deal.  Would you expect anything less?  Please let me know who 
will be working on this from your group or call to discuss any questions.  
Thanks.

Brant,  We need to ask PCS Nitrogen if they are a wholly owned subsidiary of

Hi Mom,  Hope everything is going well.  Sorry to hear about the relatives.  
I am doing fine.  Staying busy with work.  

I am scheduling a trip to China in June.  My friend Eric's has a brother who 
lives in China and is getting married to a Chinese national.  He invited me 
along, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to see a part of the 
world that I likely would not otherwise see.  We will be going from June 4  
through June 16.  Flying into the city of Shanghai and from there going to a 
smaller town called Qingdao.  The wedding will take place in Qingdao.  Should 
be interesting to experience a Chinese wedding.  We will then go to Beijing 
for sightseeing.  Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, Great Wall etc.    Should 
be a great experience.  

My roommate will be moving out in a couple of weeks and is getting married 
May 5 in Des Moines, Iowa.  I will going up for the wedding.  Take care and 
talk to you later.

Ozzie,  Steve Van Hooser forwarded two agreement for electric service from 
CP&L for the Elizabethtown and the Lumbertown cogen facilities for my 
review.  I have reviewed the documents and they are standard tariff type 
service agreements.  There are two items to which I would like to draw your 
attention.  These deals look to have a 10 year term since they are being 
served from Transmission Service.  

1.  If Customer terminate earlier, there would be a termination payment equal 
to the loss in salvage value of the facilities used to serve the Customer.  
Not sure what this value is, but might be significant, depending on what 
facilities CP&L would install to serve these plants.

2.  There is a minimum bill each month that Customer would have to pay, even 
if there was no usage of power by Customer.

If you are OK with these issues, I will initial the agreements and forward 
these  to you for signature. 

Please contact me at x33512 if you would like to discuss.

Yo Pa:

They're just whining. It means nothing. I'm glad Bush Jr. didn't sell the
Aegis boats to Taiwan yet; if he had the Butchers of Beijing would have
raised a big stink. The common people read the newspapers, drink their tea,
and complain a little, but they won't raise the topic with a foreigner they
don't know personally. Remember- Sun Tze wrote the "Art of War" 2500 years
ago. We're doing exactly what the Chinese would do if they were able to, and
they understand this.

If the PLA weren't so stupid and belligerent a majority of the Taiwanese
would probably agree to a slowly enacted "One Country-Two Systems"
arrangement like Hong Kong and Macau. Unfortunately, the PLA adds 50 missles
every year on the Fujian coast aimed at Taiwan, and ceaselessly threatens
the Taiwanese. Also, the continued antagonism between the Kuomingtang (Chang
Kai Shek's KMT) and the commies doesn't help. Taiwan's economy is developed
and robust, a "little dragon" of East Asia; while the mainland still has 900
million peasants wiping their asses with leaves. If you were Taiwan would
you be racing to re-join the motherland? Jiang Ze Min promised the
hardliners in 1993 when he was coming to power that he would bring Taiwan
back in to the fold. This isn't going to happen during his tenure. He's
finished in 2003, and he's bummed that the glory of a unified China won't be
ascribed to him. Sorry, chum.

This won't affect the wedding or the Chinese people's reaction to your
presence in the motherland. This is a wedding, and everything should be back
to normal by June. None of my Chinese colleagues flip me shit about it. If
they raise the topic I just say I don't formulate American foreign policy.
If they have any questions or comments they can direct them to Colin Powell.
I'm a common bloke just like them and they understand. As they say in
Alabama, "It's all gooood."

Yesterday Ai Ping and I finally reserved all the hotel rooms for everybody
in Qingdao. I've got you booked from June 8-10: three nights. You'll be on
the 29th floor in the presidential suite- you've got 170 square meters and a
great view of the ocean. The room consists of a huge living room, two
bedrooms, a kitchenette and a bathroom. I'll be living with you on June 8th,
and then move to another room on the wedding night. Eric and Jeff will be on
the same floor. This hotel was built for the PLA brass in the late 1970's,
but now caters to corporate clients who want to live and work in the same
building.

Check your plane tickets to make sure when you're arriving in Shanghai. Is
it June 5th or 6th? If you leave Minneapolis on the 5th, you'll probably be
arriving in Shanghai on the 6th. Let me know. Ai Ping's heading back to
Taiyuan tonight for some final prep work in Shanxi. Later she'll be
returning to Qingdao one more time to make final arrangements. I'm swamped
with UK, US and Australian visa prep work. Right now is crunch time for me.
The weather here is great. Should be nice and steambath-like by the time you

Mark,  The following are my responses to Phillip's changes in our letter 
agreement:

1.  1st Sentence of Second Paragraph - Strike of reference to Section 3.3 and 
reference to Appendix 1 - ENA's right to decrease confirmed volumes and 
Phillips' rights to release the gas are clearly set out in Section 3.3.  The 
"Operations/Delivery Scheduling Procedures" only are the method by which this 
is effected.  This change needs to be removed.

2.  1st Sentence of Second Paragraph  - The remainder of the changes to the 
1st Sentence except for the strike of Seller's Daily Deliverability are OK.  
Seller's Daily Deliverability needs to remain as this is the correct 
terminology under the Purchase Agreement.  All we are doing here is effecting 
the provisions of the Purchase Agreement to which both parties have already 
agreed.

3.  The added sentence at the end of the second paragraph - This needs to be 
stricken.  The Medicine Bow System is not ENA's and we do not want to create 
a firm purchase deal with this letter. 

4.  1st Sentence of Third Paragraph - The add from "that quantity of Gas..... 
to.......... (the "Released Gas"" should be removed.  The term Released Gas 
is defined under the Purchase Agreement and doesn't need to be defined in 
this letter.   I am OK with ENA "hereby" agreeing to waive any and all rights 
it has to under Section 3.3 to recall the Gas.  However,  the term rights ENA 
"may" have needs to be stricken.  ENA's position is that we have the right to 
recall the gas as long as it hasn't been released longer than 120 days.     

If you wish to discuss these comments or would like me to discuss these with 
Phillips, I would be happy to do so.
Paul,  Attached are the Greeley Docs.  They include:

Master Firm Enfolio
Confirmation to Enfolio
Letter Agreement governing the Transport and Storage Arrangements

Please forward to the appropriate persons at Greeley.
Steve,  I will be there.

713-853-7238Stephanie,  I would suggest modifying Section 9.4 as follows:

9.4  Addendum 1, attached to this Agreement, the bid procedures under which 
the transportation capacity hereunder was obtained, is hereby incorporated by 
reference as part of this Agreement, solely for informational purposes only.Chris,  Attached is a draft of the letter agreement between ENAP and ENA and 
Enron South America.  Please review and forward any comments you have.   
There is an existing Confid. Agreement with ENAP which runs through January 
21, 2002.  The letter I have attached piggybacks off of this existing CA.     

Does Enron South America have local counsel who can answer whether certain 
provisions in the Agreement, such as choice of Texas law, are valid under 
Chilean law?  We need to verify this or Texas law may not be binding.

Let me know if you want to discuss or have any questions.


FYI  Attached is the draft gas agreement I had forwarded to EES earlier.  I 
did not receive a response.

Bo,  Attached is the draft of the gas agreement for the StageCoach 
transaction.  There are still a few blanks for which Andrew is getting the 
information.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.



Also to follow up on our discussion from earlier concerning who would 
actually contracts with the PPL for the Utility Agreement;  we had earlier 
discussed Tennessee Gas Pipeline contracting with the Utility with EES acting 
as their agent for interaction with the Utility.  However, I think it should 
be EES who contracts with the Utility to receive electric service.  TGP has 
contracted with ECS for Compression Services and ECS has contracted with EES 
for power.  TGP has no need for a power deal.  Let me know what you think 
about this.

It is my understanding that EES is working on a revised draft of the TA for 
the Power Contract.  Let me know if this is not correct.  Thanks.

Attached is the assignment.

Please disregard to prior version and use this one.

AP--

               In a shocking move that will have the rest of the Big 12 
playing recruiting
               "catch-up", OU has snatched a solid commitment from all-state 
wide out
                                  
               Delmer Shanks

               As a freshman, Shanks is expected to play in the "Opossum" set 
of OU's
               daunting new offense. 
               "The opossum spread is going to really fool people next year", 
Shanks
               explained in a phone interview from an Oklahoma Kwickie Mart.
               "In the possum set, we take the left tackle and line him up 
out with 2 or 3
               of our receivers. I lay up in the backfield, like a opossum, 
and then the
               center hikes the ball to the Tight End and then it's a hand 
off to either me
               or the quarterback.".
               When asked about why he commited to OU in the middle of the 
season,
               a usually slow time of year for recruiting, Shanks had this to 
say.
               "Well it was a no-brainer really.Skoalis going to be 
sponsoring OU
               athletics next year, so it just seemed like a natural fit. I 
really liked what
               they're gonna do with the uniforms, that sown-in dip ring 
they're putting on
               everyone's back pockets are gonna look real nice. They're also 
gonna do
               some neat stuff with the Switzer center too, gonna sell moon 
pies and
               stuff at the door."
               Shanks did not take any official visits to other schools 
before his
               commitment, though he did say Texas A&M and OU had expressed
               interest in him all along.
               "Yeah, they were plenty nice at A&M and Coach Slocum talked to
               momma a lot on the phone. He told her that this was gonna be 
the year
               they would pass more and that I would fit in real good with 
their high
               power pro-style attack".
               It turns out that Delmer's mother did influence his decision 
some. A
               laughing Shanks explains,
               "Yeah, we was out back pitching washers and momma come 
hollering
               outside...said Stoops promised her I would wear #8 at OU.
               We all been Dale Earnhardt Jr. fans for a long time, so we 
seen the
               importance of what they was saying. They don't honor you like 
that OU
               unless they done taken a real liking to you."
               As the interview came to a close, Shanks had this to say,
               "Keep an eye on us, cause we're gonna be pretty darn good next 
year.
               We got 11 man plays in the book where the whole line is gonna 
go out on
               pass routes and we keep the water boy in to block for the 
quarterback.
               Boomer Sooner."
               Only time will tell if schools like Texas, Nebraska and others 
can keep up
               with Stoops and his amazing program.Ann,  Sorry for not getting back to you on this.  I have some answers on the 
issues that were on my to do list.  It might make the most sense for me to 
comment in response to your memo dated March 8, and forward to you.  I know 
there were several items that you were checking with your people and I would 
note those.  Let me know what you think.

Hello Gerald,

I just wanted to drop you a line to apologize for not getting the letter
response out to you.

Do you know if Russell contacted the Canadian office about issuing the
Canadian draft agreements for review and finalization with the U.S.
contracts?  I thought that was his intent, but we have received nothing as
yet.

Have a wonderful Easter holiday!

I will try to address first thing next week.

Talk to you then.

Tx.

Ann
Clement,  Please review AEC's additions and let me know what you think.
Ann,  Attached is the memo AEC forward with ENA's responses redline.  Please 
review.  When you get AEC's response completed we probably should set up a 
conference call to discuss and finalize.  Thanks.
Bruce,  

Enron North America Corp.  selected 4 candidates for interview for summer 
clerkship positions from the resumes you forward.  Two were made offers with 
both accepting the offers.  The two clerks we have working this summer are:

Alisha Mahabir - South Texas College of Law
Nabil Nachawati - University of Houston Law Center

Nabil will be working the 1st half of the summer and Alisha will be working 
the 2nd half of the summer.  Thanks for all your help with this process.  If 
you need any further information, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 
853-3512.

Gerald NemecI do have comments to the proposed revisions.  I will compile them and return 
to you shortly.

Sent for Bob Walker 


A group of us have decided to gather for dinner on the Wednesday night before 
the legal conference and wish to extend an invitation for you to join us for 
good food and fellowship and maybe a few drinks.  We have reservations for 
8:00 pm at Delores Del Rio, which is a small Italian restaurant on the 
river.  They have excellent food and live Jazz music.  Very small and quaint 
little place and away from the crush of the party places on the river.

I will need to give a final head count to the restaurant on Wednesday.  If 
you can join us, or know of anyone who would like to, please let me know and 
I will get directions, or we can all walk over from the hotel.  It is a very 
short walk.

Please let me know if you can attend.

Thanks,

Bob.


Attached is the latest draft of the CSA based on our discussion.  Please 
forward to the appropriate individuals for review and comment.
Attached are the latest drafts (Clean and redlined).  There are still blanks 
to be filled in for the numbers.  Please review.  The only question they

		 Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are 
being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is 
available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be 
used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have 
to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these 
spaces.

Attached is the response.  Please review ASAP as they are trying to file 
today to meet the response deadlines.

Andrew, Gerald

Attached is the meeting notes from a 1 hour meeting we had with Cantera
Resources and Tom Brown on April 24.  We will be meeting with them again on
Monday, May 7 in Dallas.  This meeting will involve the president and
operations manager of Cantera as well.  While the last meeting was more of
introductions and high level "where we are"  and "what are the issues"
discusssion, this meeting will be more definitive where we plan to discuss
the pressure and curtailment issues in more detail, and we will be
discussing moving the Entrada from San Arroyo to our plant.  I am sure they
will also want to discuss some sort of agreement for us to move foreward
together on the low-Btu project.   Tom Brown representatives will be
involved via phone - as they must until the deal closes.  We told Cantera it
may be a very short meeting as there are certain things we won't talk about
in front of Tom Brown.

In our meeting on Monday - which will start at noon with lunch, I want to be
able to show them a couple of things.  I want to show them Graphs 2-2.1-A
and 2-2.1-B and Figure 2-2.2 out of section 3 of the Contract Issues book I
gave you.  I want to also show them Graphs 3-2.1-A and 3-2.1-B and Figures
3-1 out of section 4 of the book.   I was not planning on discussing the
monitary value associated with these graphs (the sum of these issues totals
just under $1MM economic harm to Crescendo as I calculated from June through
December 2000.)

Andrew, I will call you in the morning to discuss in more detail what we
should and should not show them or discuss concerning the issues.  I will be
on my cell phone at 915-349-8223 all morning.

Thanks,

Ken Krisa

Barry,  Attached is a draft of the Payment One statement.  This one is set up 
for the wire transfer, so slight mods would be required for a payment by 
check.  Please review and lets discuss.
Ken,  Could you please verify the legal name for the Enron entity that will 
be the counterparty in the temp. interconnect agreement.  Is it Enron Clean 
Fuels Company?

GeraldJohn,  I would be happy to review you.  No problem.

I will prepare the documents.  Attached is the contract form that Crestone 
forwarded for their payment.  This would be a schedule to an existing Master 
Services Agreement in place between ENA and Crestone.
I tried to send this yesterday, but I received a message that it didn't go

The Northern Border guys would like to recognize their $500,000 in earnings 
associated with  the Kern Capacity that they syndicated in the 3rd Quarter 
and make it part of the Master Service Agreement between ENA and Crestone.  
This is the document that they proposed.  We should recognize some additional

legal standpoint?

Greg,  Attached is a redlined version  of the interconnect agreement with 
their comments incorporated.  I did make some revision to their comments,  
please review and if OK forward to Brazos Valley or their reps.  

Do we have any concerns from a credit standing concerning this LP.  I don't 
know the magnitude of cost on the HPL Facilities, but we need to make sure we 
don't get stuck with their cost.  Might want to ask for cash up front with a 
make whole once the facilities are completed.  I haven't made any changes to 
reflects.  Thoughts?

 Greg,  I thought that was for the Rio Nogales project.  The Brazos Valley 
interconnect has no specific provisions for assignment to Pinnacle.

if the Interconnect is assigned, as is permitted by the Interconnect

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

Attached is my letter and here are the some additional terms - 

Seller shall provide informal pricing information to Buyer on a regular 
basis.  Buyer and Seller can agree to a mechanism to facilitate this 
process.  Pricing for various risk management products can be provided at the 
request of the customer.
  
 Customer will not be exposed to daily prices, even during OFO periods

 Seller can provide accounting services to handle all payables for 
transportation capacity and therefore provide a consolidated statement for 
gas supply and transportation.

Seller is prepared to work with the Buyer to manage any new acquisitions that 
take place during the course of any agreement.  However, Seller maintains the 
right to reprice the products and services provided under such agreement if 
such acquisition materially affects the scope of the original offer.

They selected a three year deal, however, termination language will need to 
be negotiated. We will wait for Mike Grigsby to get back to determine some of 
that language.  If they terminate with in one or two years, they will be 
required to pay the difference in the demand charge for the period we 
provided this service and the $.08.

Please let me know what else I can do to help facilitate this process.

Thanks,

Kim

Yes,  That would be helpful.  Let me know what time you want to meet.

We have two Summer Clerks coming in this summer which we have hired through 
the Houston Bar Association Minority Recruitment Program.   Majed Nachawati 
will be starting Monday May 21st.  He will be here 6 weeks and Alisha Mahibar 
will start on July 2 and be here the final 6 weeks.  

Enron Corp. also has hired two law summer clerks from UT .  These clerks will 
be doing 4 week rotations throughout Enron and we will have them each for a 
four week  period.  Dates are still being finalized.

Samantha Ferguson, an HBA law clerk from last summer, will again support the 
Global Market group this summer.

I would like to have a point person from each of your groups with the charge 
of getting these clerks involved in the project flow for each group.  My plan 
is to have these clerks work with two groups during their time here with the 
groups rotating during the summer.  Please, consider who in your groups would 
be best suited for this role and provide feedback as soon as possible.  I 
will take this role for the East Origination-Gas Trading group.  Thanks for 
all your help.Attached are my revisions to the Lost Creek Gathering Agreement for the Devon 
deal. Please review and let me know if you have any issues.
Kim,  I will forward two hard copy executables to you.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.

 Give Molly a call and check with her.  She may want you to report to her 
first.  Otherwise we'll see you on the 21st.

Joe

I have tried to call you several times but no luck.  I want to discuss the
proposed right of way.

With reference to consideration, Howell is not agreeable to 10% down.  We
expect 100%, further I believe we will require a minimum of $2,500
providing we agree on $12.00 per rod.

In the grant delete "communication line(s)".  Line 7 insert "pipeline"
before "communication equipment".  Further we need to delete any reference
to surface equipment other than markers, wireleads, vent pipes and
communication equipment.  If a gate plant, ground valve, pigging equipment
or cathodic protection equipment is to be located on Howell's property we
will need other agreements.  The systems Howell operated in Texas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida were contracted in this manner.

Paragraph 3 we need to address our current operations in the area and its
precedence.

Paragraph 4 replace normal plow depth with a "minimum of four (4) feet"

Paragraph 8 and 12 I think will not be approved by management and it would
make expediting the execution of this document easier.

Paragraph 9, Howell in no way will grant any Power of Attorney for
anything.  Any amendment will be executed by Howell.  Delete all references
to POA in entire agreement and Exhibits.  Further we prefer the entire
right of way be recorded not a memorandum.

Paragraph 16 after "Right-of-way Grant" insert except for the term
"pipeline".

Paragraph 17 delete any reference to Tenant in the entire agreement.  We
will secure execution by the Bank, you may deal with the tenants.

Further, I believe we will need an indemnification provision protecting
Howell from any operation performed pursuant to this grant.

Let's talk.  We will make a deal that all parties can live with.  Our
perspective is a little different than the average rancher.

Attached is a short outline of the proposed steps to transfer the Compressor 
Motors, NTUA Contract, and TW Contracts to ECS LLC.  I know we still don't 
have structure approval, but I can begin working on the documentation for 
those items that will not likely change (the transfer of assets and 
contracts).

Please review and let me know of any issues or problems.






Amelia,  Can you check on contract # 96021047 to see if this is any current 
transport activity on this contract.  This contract was never executed.  
Reliant HL&P informed me that this contract is no longer being used and they 
would prefer to terminate or void this contract.

within a couple of weeks.

Below you will find the electronic version of the NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution brochure and application (NewPower trifold.pdf).  
To participate in the pilot, simply:

Remember, the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution pilot 
program is completely FREE to the first 500 participants.  Free hardware, 
free installation, free service calls, and no monthly service fees or hidden 
charges.  At the conclusion of the pilot, those first 500 pilot participants 
will be "Grandfathered" so Remote Energy Management will remain free to them 
should the service be continued as a real mass market product.  



Remember, to participate in the pilot, you must meet the following 
qualifications:

1)  You must reside in the Greater Houston Area.  The outer limits or our

is DSL or Cable and who the service provider is (i.e. PDQ.net, SBC, 
Earthlink, etc.).  Just write it anywhere.















If you like our NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution, feel 
free to forward this brochure and application to your friends and family.  



Thank you,
The New Power Company







Please review.   
Here is the revised letter.
Marlene,  We need to ask the counterparty what type of liens they have on 
their gas and we would want to limit it to those types in the contract.  We 
need as specific a description as possible.  If you want me to talk to 
someone at the counterparty I would be glad to do so.  Need a name and phone 
number.  Thanks.

On or about September 23, 1999 a request for service was placed by the above

Agreement and 311 Gas Transportation Agreement.  These agreements were 
forwarded to the counterparty, CCNG, Inc..  On or about October 6, 1999,

informed me that Section 7 of the agreement, which reads  in part: Gas is 
free from liens and adverse claims of every kind, should be changed because 
the gas that the counterparty will be transporting on HPL may and/or  is 
subject to liens.  She was instructed to destroy the agreement and another 
would be forwarded to her with the necessary corrections and re-wording of 
Section 7.

Attached find the agreements for the necessary changes in Section 7.  Kelly 
Cloud has instructed me to call with any further questions.

Sounds like the trip was AMAAAAZING!!!.  Laura should seriously consider

about what had taken place the night before." Mark,  Attached are the committed reserves GTC along with a confirm for each 
of WIC's Contract #1 and Contract #2.  Please review.
Please review the attached I added some language at the end of the intrastate 
warranty.  To the extent this warranty gets changed, we will have to change 
the warranty in the gathering agreement.

Greetings!  Wow, I'm back, its hard to believe.  Sitting at my desk trying
to get used to being here in the office and having people shout hey Mrs.
Ruppert is kind of freaky too.  I'm ready for my afternoon siesta which
I've
become accustomed to in the last couple weeks.

Well I must say the honeymoon was amazing!  Everything I could have wanted
and just what we needed. We truly had a wonderful time.  The trip there was

quite exhausting especially after the wedding and all.  we got settled into

Athens around 4 p.m. Monday.  Our hotel had a balcony which had a wonderful

view of the Acropolis.  Athens is pretty dirty and the Greeks there are
kind
of assholes, but I really didn't think it was as bad as people kept telling

me, I mean its a big city.  We did our own walking tour of all the ruins (I

try to avoid large groups of formal tours).  We took a ferry to Santorini
and stayed there for 3 days.  Loved it!  We ate some faboulous restaurants
on cliffs overlooking the water.  Lots of shrimp, squid, lamb, vegetables,
bread and of course my favorite THE WINE! We rented a car one day and drove

all over the entire island stopping periodically at various beaches to
absorb the rays.  Unfortunately we hadn't anticipated laying out so we
didn't bring swimsuits.  As being the sport I am I wanted to be apart of
the
culture so I took the rays in in just my briefs.  Ryan surprisingly left
his
shorts on this time???  Loved the black beaches!  We tried to find a more
private beach to partake in some skinny dipping, but were busted at our
attempt.  We went to an area called Oia on Santorini, which was amazing.
We
drove down the mountain and at the bottom there was this bay area enclosed
in rock with a few tavernas.  so we had dinner there and watched the
sunset.
  The most amazing seafood!  They took us in their kitchen to show us what
they had caught that day. We also took a boat out to the volcano at Ryan's
request being a geologist and all.  We hiked 2 1/2 miles all uphill and
then
of course back down.  We went to the hot springs which Ryan said wasn't so
hot, I did not venture in the water.  After the ride we had to get all the
way back to the top so we took donkeys of course.  Quite an adventure as we

were weaving around these narrow paths on the edge of the cliff!  Luckily
mine was tame, Ryan's however was a jackass(mmm, appropriate I thought).

We also took a ferry to Ios, which unfortunately it rained the whole day so

we stayed inside, slept and later went to some bars and met some great
people which we later went out with that night.  You all should have seen
Ryan at the discos!

Our final destination was Naxos about a 2 1/2 ferry ride from Santorini.
Ate, shopped, toured the island, slept on the beach, drank, ate again and
slept.  Loved this island a lot.  Not as touristy and the greeks were very
pleasant and charming. Would have loved to stay there longer.

All in all the wedding was fabulous.  I was very happy with the wedding
festivities too.  And of course as everyone had said it went by sooo fast.

The next morning Ryan and I were so confused about what had taken place the

night before.  I cannot believe I am a married woman, its all so surreal!
The few days prior to the wedding I was so nervous and emotional about
everything!  Its just so overwhelming.  One of the best parts was sitting
on
the alter in the cathedral and looking out upon our friends and family and
people's faces lighting up.  Knowing that all those people were there to
share in our special moment was just so wonderful.  Of course I wish I
could
have spent more time chatting with each and everyone one of you.  We were
so
honored you all traveled so far for us!

I am definitely on cloud 9 now and would have to say I feel the happiest
I've ever been!  Thanks again for joining us it truly meant a lot.  I hope
you all had a wonderful time and enjoyed yourselves.  Everyone was
surprisingly on their best behavior...frankly I was a little disappointed
in
you gals!  Except for Falb she always pulls through with something!
Anyway,
love to hear from you all soon. Hope everyone is well!

Forever Gams!

I'm thinking they were targeting you guys for some of these...Gerald, I
think numbers four (the official third stage of G), eight (picking fights
and pushing Eric and/or Ryan after drinking) and eleven (I'm so smart
because I work at Enron and you can't teach this you pauper, I need to pump
up my pomp) are for you. Jeff, numbers two (I'll go upstairs right now and
talk to my neighbors and ask them if I'm too loud), five & three (Sinatra
and shadow dancing) and thirteen (every time we go out) are yours. And
Eric, number ten is you. Although the rash would be caused by a mysterious,
moving ramp or stairs and the redness would occur on your ass, not your
forehead!




Due to increasing products liability litigation, American beer brewers
have accepted the FDA's suggestion that the following warning
labels be placed immediately on all beer containers:

1. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may leave you wondering what
the hell happened to your bra.

2. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may make you think you are
whispering when you are not.

3. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol is a major factor in dancing
like an retard.

4. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may cause you to tell your
friends over and over again that you love them.

5. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may cause you to think you
can sing.

6. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may lead you to believe that
ex-lovers are really dying for you to telephone them at four in
the morning.

7. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may make you think you can
logically converse with other members of the opposite sex without
spitting.

8. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may make you think you have
mystical Kung Fu powers, resulting in you getting your ass
kicked.

9. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may cause you to roll over in
the morning and see something really scary.

10. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol is the leading cause of
inexplicable rug burns on the forehead.

11. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may create the illusion that
you are tougher, smarter, faster and better looking than most
people.

12. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may lead you to believe you
are invisible.

13. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may lead you to think people
are laughing WITH you.

14. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may cause a disturbance in
the times pace continuum, whereby gaps of time may seem to
literally disappear.

15. WARNING: The consumption of alcohol may cause pregnancy.





Not sure what I am supposed to do with this.

		 Subject: RE: new e-mail addy


Brudda,

I spoke with Jenn about accommodations in Beijing as well as Shanghai and
she said her dad is also getting some info from a local Chinese travel
agent.  How about dropping Dan a line and working with him to recommend &
book everyone's hotel.  His e-mail address is:  djunk_epc@yahoo.com

I believe part of the group is looking to Jon and the other part is looking
to Dan to make their accommodations for them. I hereby anoint the two of you
to make the lodging decisions for everyone else, as we are drooling cows
with no direction or relevant info.  Therefore, the two of you need to get
together and decide on a hotel (for Shanghai & Beijing), so we can all be
together and don't have to coordinate getting together everyday in freakin'
China (i.e. nightmare).  Jon maybe send an e-mail to Dan suggesting a few
hotels/price/level of accommodations/etc./your recommendation/ and then you
two make the call and book it for us.

I think the "core" group we should worry about getting
reservations/accommodations is as follows:
Shanghai: (arrival on the 5th, Jenn, Eric, Heather, Gayle, Dan, Gerald,
Barbara) 7 people-3 rooms for the night most likely (Jon you can crash in my
room)
Mom & Dad & aunt Jean and Kid arrive on the 6th (2 more room)
Jeff and Cathy arrive on the 7th (1 more room)
8th we all fly to Qing dao, hotel in Qing Dao is selected and booked
Beijing - Everyone listed above is traveling to Beijing as a group.

As far as getting rooms for the other people (Staters, Rassmussen's, etc),
that's your call, but we are operating without any real good info.  I'd say
they are on their own as we don't know when they get in, what their plans
are, etc?  If it's no big deal reserving rooms and not getting dinged if
noone shows up then maybe get a few extra rooms at certain places, I don't
know the Chinese hotel system, level of $$ exposure, hotel availability,
etc., its your call, I'd assume they can probably get a room no problem so
let's not try to coordinate more people than we have to, they can sleep on
my floor if they can't get a room in China....

This is what is called Wedding planning lotus bliss...

We are all looking forward to this...

Jon, I'm attaching a memo sent to me by one of my
previous Enron people in China.  Lillian Li no longer
works for Enron and was not available to help us in
Beijing (she got married and will be moving in June).
Anyway, she has this travel agency friend who has
recommended stuff for Shanghai and Beijing.  It's all
spelled out in the attachment.  For 3 days in
Shanghai, for ($285 per person for 3 days and
nights),$90 USD a day per person which includes hotel,
meals, transportation, tickets, etc. sounds
reasonable.  What do you think?  I do like the sight
seeing she recommended.

Then, in Beijing for 7 nights in a good hotel,
sightseeing, transportation, tickets, tour guide, etc.
for ($525 per person for 6 days and nights), $88 per
day per person didn't sound bad either.  Here in
Beijing I like the sightseeing she recommends.  Again,
what do you think?

What she failed to tell me was the cost of the airline
ticket from Shanghai to Qingdao to Beijing.  Could you
check on that for us?

If there is a better way to skin this cat (no pun
intended, just that all these Nancy boys are afraid of
the chinese food and all) please advise.

Congrats,look forward to seeing and hearing from you.....Dan

D-Rock,  Attached are a clean and redlined copy with my comments.  I have 
noted a couple of areas where I still have questions.

One that I didn't note in the agreement, is my concern that they could deny 
us a new Delivery Point if we can't agree on terms.  We need to discuss this 
one tommorrow.  I will shout out at ya tommorrow.

Let me address your topics one by one:

 1. That is fine, except that no guaranties regarding the condition of your 
entertainment center can be made for the duration of your stay.  What day are 
you planning on moving?
 2.  I have only received one piece of mail within the last week, so I think 
it is mostly working.
 3.  Eric's local  - Egillaspie@coral-energy.com  (713) 230-3576
 4.  No calls
 5.  Sounds good.  Sorry we haven't had a chance to catch up, we both have 
been running somewhere when we ran into each other at the house.  Sat. nite I 
think the Gillaspie's wanted to go to Sambuca's downtown.  Thought I might 
join them.  Might want to check with Eric to see what's up.  

Peace,  G$

Gerald,

The dust is finally starting to settle here at work and at Laura's, allow
me to address a couple of topics:

     1)  I plan to be fully moved out this weekend except that I'd like to
leave me entertainment rack in your garage for a week or two while I try to
sell it if that's OK with you.
     2)  I put in a forward for my mail but is doesn't seem to be in
effect.  I called in a complaint yesterday but until then you may continue
to receive some.  I'll just have to check every couple of days.
     3)  I still haven't caught up with Eric at all, do you have his new
work number and email?
     4)  I don't know if you're getting any calls for me but in case you
don't have it, my new number at Laura's is 527-9460.
     5)  Lastly, we need to knock back some tonsil paint this weekend
sometime.  That will give me a chance to turn my key back over to you as
well and you can go back to walking around the house naked.

That's about it.  Talk to ya later,
Ryan

Barry,  Attached are redlines of the docs with the changes we discussed 
today.  Please pay special note to the Maximum Daily Deliverability Quantity 
of the Confirm.  I want to discuss how this limits us and what flexibility 
this section needs.  Please review and lets discuss.

The importance of all long term plans to build a comfortable life faded away 
into cloud of apathy and listfulness.  No cares anymore.  Just extract as 
much as possible from each experience never knowing where it might take you.  
Wow.  Such thought before used to scare the hell out of you.  But isn't it 
ironic to finally find out no matter how much you try to control each aspect 
of your existence, it could end up somewhere completely unforeseeable 
anyway.  You have no control.  No control.  So why try to control it.  Why 
not open yourself up to all those unknowns, those risks, those potential 
great failures.You didn't hit your face on the pavement at any point in the evening did 
you?  In case you didn't know, Barbara and I are going to China with Eric.  I 
will be leaving June 4 and returning June 16.  Any chance I could get you to 
drop buy every couple of days and pick up my newspaper and mail and put them 
inside?  Would appreciate it.  

I pay her $50 per visit and she comes every two weeks.  Not a bad deal.

A little of the sauce got in the way of some of my moving plans this
weekend.  I should be out this week sometime, though.

What do you pay that cleaning lady per month?  Not having to do laundry
anymore all most makes it worth it, huh?  We might have to look into that.

Subject: Re: Trip Details


Dan:

Can you imagine trying to set this up without the internet? It would be
impossible. Anyway, here's a quick update from the battlefield. In regards
to flight plans, we had a minor setback today. We called our local Wuxi
travel agent who is setting up the majority of our airplane tix. I asked her

if we needed to provide them with full names that are on passports. After
much heated debate she said no. However, we then called Shanghai Pudong
Airport staff to see what their response was to our enquiry. They demanded
that all flight tickets show the full names that are on passports.
Therefore, I'll need for you to provide me with the full names (first,
middle, last) for everybody in your group. We'll then pass these on to the
Wuxi agent who has already lined up the Shanghai>Qingdao flight. We'll also
provide the full names to agents who'll be setting up the other flights.

Secondly, let me give you a status report on the Beijing leg of the journey.

After you sent us your Beijing tour package info we consulted with Lin Qing.

We then asked our travel agent friend in Qingdao, Zang Bao Guo, to line us
up with his agents in Beijing to get another price quote. Jeff felt that the

$525/person fee was too much; he stated that he had retirement savings to
consider (ha!). We've spent the last couple days in negotiations with
another Beijing agent to see if she could provide us with essentially the
same Beijing tour package at a more budget-minded price. Today she gave us a

rough idea on the price of the alternative Beijing tour package. The
estimated price would be about $520/couple for the same five day package in
Beijing. This is in comparison to your price quite of $525/person for a five

day package. We would downgrade from a 5 star hotel to a 4 star hotel (it's
new). Keep in mind that we're still hammering out the details, but the
alternative package seems to be the one that would be the easiest on the
wallet.

The crude itinerary would look something like this:

June 11- fly to Beijing in the morning; check into hotel; tour the Forbidden

City; see Chinese style acrobatics show in the evening.

June 12- Great Wall; Ding Temple (tombs); Beijing roast duck dinner.

June 13- Temple of Heaven; Summer Palace; dinner at the Old Beijing Tea
House (singing and other entertainment provided).

June 14- Tiananmen Square; Beihai Park; lunch at Beihai King's Food
Restaurant (this place serves meals that the royalty would have eaten during

the Qing Dynasty); Yong He Gong (Tibetan temple); free evening.

June 15- Hutong alley tour; lunch at a Xinjiang (Chinese Muslim cuisine)
restaurant; Wangfujing Street (shopping at the trendy stores); Beijing opera

in the evening.

June 16- most folks would fly out of Beijing to USA or Shanghai.

We knocked out some destinations from the original plan. For example, the
dancing performance and the trip to Liu Li Chang (antique shopping). Ai Ping

called the agent about the dancing show and decided it wouldn't be very
interesting: it featured some Western dancing styles and the same crap we
see on TV every night. The dance performance didn't include any minority
group dances or "traditional" village styles, so Ai Ping didn't think it
sounded very "Chinese." If the antique shopping is desired (it's an
on-the-street auction, with other stores selling original and
not-so-original "fake" items) we can slap it back on the itinerary. I don't
give a hoot either way. I aim to please and we are extremely flexible. Ai
Ping's hometown is six hours west of Beijing. She's been to Beijing a
billion times; she doesn't care where we go. Let me know what you think and
we'll do as instructed.

Thirdly, I don't think we'll be needing any deposit money. The airplane tix
will be reserved in your names. The Wuxi agent said she would arrange to
have your Shanghai>Qingdao tix brought to your hotel in Shanghai and that
you could pay there. The Qingdao>Beijing tix can be paid for in Qingdao upon

arrival. The Beijing agent hasn't mentioned a  deposit for the tour package
yet. If she does, I'll put the money down- no problem.

So that leaves you with making the decision on whether or not you want to do

the Shanghai tour package: your call. It looks like a good plan to me. If
you want any assistance with the Shanghai leg of the journey we can do it.
Let me know.

Hope this gives you an idea on where we're at. Please respond asap with
comments/questions. Hope all is swell in Tejas. Will write again soon.

My Regards,

Jon Gillaspie

Subject: CPS Interconnect Agreement

As per our conversation yesterday, I have a heightened concern about the CPS 
Interconnect Agreement as drafted, as it implies that HPL can perform at 
certain levels based on the facilities being installed.  This is incorrect in 
probably all cases, and I need your assistance in drafting a cover letter to 
help clarify HPL's position to CPS as to our ability to perform, and more so, 
our contractual obligation to perform relative to this proposed contract 
draft.  All this contract does is agree that HPL will allow the facilities 
they are requesting to be installed, subject to Tejas Gas' approval (JV 
responsibility), at their cost.  There is no commitment to flow any volume of 
gas on any basis under this agreement.  Any such obligation would have to be 
negotiated and agreed to in writing separately.  Please provide draft 
response.  If you have any questions, please call.

		 Subject: Law Conference -- CLE & CPE Credit

We have received inquiries from several attorneys who attended only the 
Thursday session of the Enron Corp. Law Conference in San Antonio.  If you 
have not already contacted someone about CLE credit for Thursday,  please 
send an e-mail to Becky Zikes stating that you attended the Thursday 
session.  This will enable you to claim 3.50 hours total credit, with 1.25 
hours ethics credit for Thursday.  If you have any questions, please contact 
Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103.   Please respond by 
Thursday, May 31 since we need to finalize our CLE filings with the various 
state bar organizations. 


If you wish to receive CPE credit (for certified public accountants) for the 
Law Conference, please  send an e-mail to Becky Zikes and we will get the 
appropriate certificate prepared.  Again, any questions should be directed to 
Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103. 

Thanks for your help.

Kim,  Attached are the revised documents for Palo Alto.  The documents are 
revised to reflect the deal term comments that the City forwarded.  I changed 
the name of the document to Natural Gas Services Agreement to address their 
concerns about a non commodity agreement.  I have also added language 
requiring a City Council resolution to for this document.  Instead of a legal 
opinion, we would require the City Attorney to approve both the Natural Gas 
Services and Transaction Agreements.  In included a redline of the services 
agreement from the prior version.  The Transaction Agreement would not 
redline on MS word for some reason.  I will request my assistant to redline 
it for you on Monday using comparewrite.  If you need help prior to my 
return, please coordinate with Jeff Hodge.  Please forward these documents to 
the City if you are okay with them.   Thanks.
Rae,  Please redline the No4 against the original No3 on compare write and 
forward via email to Kim Ward.  MS word would not redline correctly.

OK Kids:

This will be one of your last major briefings before your Mars landing. Good

luck cosmonauts! Remember one thing: the Martians are a little weird from
our standpoint, but essentially they are harmless and good-natured bipeds
like us. Now, let's begin with the pre-landing meeting.


ERIC/DAN'S GROUP:

Shanghai hotel: Jin Chang Hotel.

Hotel price: $37 USD/night (300 yuan).

Heather's single room rate: $27 USD/night.

Tour package price: $34 USD total/person (280 yuan) this price is for June
5-8.

Meals: Meals not included in package. Your group will need to arrange and
pay for your own meals with the assistance of your guide/translator. Your
translator will accompany you to the restaurants if you wish. He/she can
help you order and suggest dishes which represent the local Shanghai
cuisine. Go ahead and pay for your guide's meal if you choose to bring them
along for dinner (it won't be very expensive). This option will give you
more freedom.

Admission tickets: Also not included in the tour package. You'll need to pay

for admission to the Yu Yuan Gardens, Yu Fo Si (Buddhist Temple), Shanghai
Art Museum, etc.

Airport service: Jin Chang Hotel staff will pick you up at Pudong Airport in

Shanghai. Ai Ping and I will accompany them and meet you. They'll also take
you and the rest of the group to the airport on June 8th for your flight to
Qingdao.

We got a special hotel rate for the group through one of Ai Ping's friends,
Lucy Hong. Her company, Rosemont Corp. (Dallas, TX), has a special
arrangement with the hotel. When you check in you should tell the clerks
that you're checkin in under the Rosemont Corp's name so as to receive the
special discount. Don't worry- we'll be there to assist you when you check
in.


MOM/DAD'S GROUP:

Hotel name: Jin Chang Hotel, same as above.

Hotel price: $37 USD/night (300 yuan), same as above.

Tour package price: $24 USD total/person, reduced price because one day less

in Shanghai.

Airport service: Jin Chang Hotel staff will pick you up at the airport and
take you to the airport for your Qingdao flight on June 8th.]

Note: you also need to check-in under the Rosemont Corp. name.


JEFF/CATHY:

Hotel name: Jin Chang Hotel, same as above.

Hotel price: same as above.

No tour package.

Airport service: none. You'll need to take a taxi into Shanghai from Pudong
Airport. You could also take a bus, but I'm not sure which of the 4-5 buses
you would need to take. Jeff, I'll have Ai Ping try and send you the Hotel
name and address in Chinese so you can just show it to the taxi driver. I'm
not sure whether or not your computer will accept Chinese script, but we'll
give it a try. The Jin Chang Hotel is relatively new, so most of the taxi
drivers don't know where it is without a little assistance. Not to worry,
we'll figure something out to make sure you don't end up in Chengdu after
your trans-Pacific hop.

You'll join the rest of the group the following morning on the hotel bus to
the airport for your Qingdao flight.


THE FOLLOWING ARE THE NAMES AND PHONE NUMBERS FOR THE VARIOUS HOTELS YOU'LL
BE STAYING IN:

SHANGHAI: Jin Chang Hotel
Telephone: 021-6298 8899

QINGDAO: Donghai Hotel
Telephone: 053-2388 7070

BEIJING: Beijing International Hotel
Telephone: 010-6512 6688

When you call these numbers you should say in perfect Mandarin, "Qian tai."
This means "front desk." Then start blabbing in your most unintelligible
English. The hotel staff will then understand that they've got a foreign
devil on the line making trouble, and they'll find someone who can speak
Chinglish with you.

Ai Ping and Jon Gillaspie's mobile phone number: 013033511842.
We got Ai Ping's cell phone hooked up again specifically to assist all
parties in their entrance to the middle kingdom. Do not hesitate to call us
any any time of the day if you need help. I'm serious!

Ai Ping's beeper number: 1922202866. You can use this number also.


BEIJING TOUR PACKAGE DETAILS:

Hotel name: Beijing International Hotel, 5 star hotel.

Hotel price: $70 USD/night (570 yuan).

Total package price: $550 USD/couple total.
This price does not include beverages (ie. in restaurants we buy the booze).

We'll also need to pay for the roast Beijing duck dinner, and the Xinjiang
restaurant dinner (Chinese Muslim cuisine).

Tour package itinerary: same as before with some minor changes; will inform
group of changes tomorrow.

That's all for now folks. I'm spent, and can no longer look at a computer
monitor without becoming cross-eyed. More info will be sent tomorrow. Any
questions: you know who to contact. Zaijian comrades, may the proletarian
revolution continue!

The East is Red,

Jon Gillaspie












_________________________________________________________________________
Get Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com.Shonnie,  Attached are my comments per our discussion.
Mark,  Attached are rough drafts of the following documents for the noted 
projects:

Bay Gas Storage
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft Lease Agreement
3.  Draft O&M Agreement



Oakhill
1.  Draft CSA
2.  Draft O&M Agreement for Hanover to provide maintenance.



Please note that these are really rough based on the limited information 
available at this time.  I did not provide a lease agreement for Oakhill as 
you indicated Hanover would finance/lease the Electric Motor Drivers to ECS.  
If Hanover is providing a straight lease, the lease for Bay Gas could be 
used.  If Hanover is providing a purchase option, the lease agreement would 
need to be modified for the purchase option.  My suggestion is to provide 
these forms to the customer with the caveat that as the commercial terms are 
fine tuned, these drafts will be modified.  But this gives them the basic 
idea.   In my absence please contact Barbara for coordination of legal 
support in the event you cannot wait until I return.  Thanks.
Mark,  I forgot to mention in my earlier note, that for the parking/storage 
arrangement with Bay Gas, I would request their form of storage agreement.  I 
makes more sense to have a separate agreement cover the parking arrange as 
this is really independent of the compression services.  These storage 
company typically have their own agreement that not bad and usually won't use 
the counterparties paper.---------------------- Forwarded by Gerald Nemec/HOU/ECT on 10/19/99 05:42 PM

Eric:

Am in the process of arranging your Shanghai leg of the journey. Will set up

a package that allows you to choose meals. I think you should have a little
guidance in your explorations of the Shanghai area. Shanghai is a friggin
mad-house (16 million people) and if you ain't got the language skills
they will bend you over a rickshaw and ride you like a poodle. So- let me
set up your hotel and sightseeing for you. You can break loose from the
"tour group" vibe later in Qingdao. Keep in mind that you'll be in a
relatively small group (ie. it won't be a Greyhound bus packed full of
gawking blue-hairs). I'll send full Shanghai details when the biz is
finished later today...

In regards to the Beijing leg, we altered the itinerary to suit our needs.
We knocked out the bullshit and kept the bliss nuggets. You should have a
traditional Beijing roast duck dinner (it rocks!) and you should experience
Beijing Opera at least once in your life. We'll see the Beijing Opera in a
famous Beijing teahouse while sucking tea and brews and nibbling on pickled
chicken feet and other assorted delicacies. We knocked out the full two-hour

Beijing Opera performance that would have been later in the week. We'll be
staying in a Wangfujing hotel. Wangfujing is the trendy shopping street in
downtown Beijing; should make the wives happy. It'll be $70 USD/night.

Will send full Beijing details when we've finished the haggling and cheating

rituals that make life so wonderful in the middle kingdom.

Take care, guyeee.

Love,

Jon

There seems to be some confusion as to the status Kristi's star
self-contained-underwater-breathing-apparatus student (aka as SCUBA for some
of you who haven't opened the book).  So listen here:  last night I swam
8x800's at Balley's (all of which was done under water while holding my
breath) and then I practiced my float for 2.5 hours during which I quized
myself using flash cards which I had made while memorizing the text earlier
in the day.

Tonight I plan to hit Galveston bay for an open water-simulation swim and I
also intend to travel to SeaWorld in San Antonio this weekend to sneak into
their killer whale tank.

Oh, and did I mention the bitchin' new speedo I purchased?

Mr. Nemec,

Did you receive the latest WIC supplement dated 10/12/99 ??
I read it and didn't have any problems with it. It gives us VOLUMETRIC firm 
rights at 80% of the max. recourse rate on the excess ramp up volumes.

The supplement letter agreement has Enron Capital and Trade Resources Corp. 
which can be crossed out and changed - I talked to WIC about this already.
The FTSA has Enron North America Corp.

Let me know.

Subject: Transportation Gathering Contract for HPL transporting on HPL

Gerald,

Due to some changes in our business, we are needing to amend the current 
transportation contracts for HPL transporting on HPL.  We will need to amend 
the current 012-41500-02-003 contract, covering the transportation cost from 
a particular wellhead all the way to Houston Ship Channel, to become two 
contracts, one we call the "gathering agreement" (covering transportation 
cost from the wellhead to a competitive supply curve like Thompsonville zone 
or Agua Dulce zone) and then another agreement we call "marketing 
transportatin agreement" (covering transportation cost from the competitive 
supply curve to Houston Ship Channel).

We need these amendments to be effective as soon as possible since we are 
targeting making the administrative changes effective during November 
production month.  I tried to call you but was not able to be connected to 
your voice mail.

I would like to sit down with you in the next couple of days to discuss this 
change and what we need to do to have the agreements changed and the new 
gathering agreement put into place.  Please respond via email or call at 
3-1836 to discuss this issue further.  Thanks!

MY COMMENTS
Interconnect 4th sen        Do we really want to change a definition?  Or did 
we accidentally define this twice?

Operations  second sen    NO-  It is HPLC that will be nominating the gas, so 
why would we try to balance with a nom that they are not making as the 
PURCHASER.  The buy/sell agreement should handle the volume in the attachment 
of a confirm that will go out as the deals are negotiated over a short term 
basis.

Item iv  instead of inserting continuous, we should say "analyzed monthly"  
because we will already have a proportional to flow sampler on it.

Finally, I am not happy with the language on the term.....I do not think that 
we should now name a term, otherwise, termination whould go with the new 
contract sent out.


Well, call if you get a chance to conference!  713-851-3815  cell

Hello fellow Rice Alums (and other generous benefactors)!

It's that time again.....Rice 1999 Homecoming.  And we all know what that
means, don't we?.....

That's right, the complete and utter chaos at the

Tenth Annual

Ted,  Attached is a revised draft of a letter.  Please review and let me know 
if you have any comments.  Please note the following with respect to this 
issue:

 1.   We should make sure we have performed a gas analysis at each producers 
delivery point and are sure they are creating or contributing to the quality 
problem.  I recommend attaching such gas analysis to this letter.

 2.  The BRG Petroleum Corp. contract doesn't give us any cause to send this 
letter.  The contract requires BRG to meet the quality specs. of the the 
pipeline which receives the gas downstream of the Point of Delivery on the 
Confirm.  Such Point of Delivery is at the wellhead and HPL is the downstream 
pipe.  HPL's specs (unless they have changed, don't have a limitation on gas 
richness).

 3.  The Texlan letter will be slightly modified from the attached, since we 
will reference Force Majeure.

 4.  Do we have a accurate list of producer names and address?  If you are 
okay with the letter, I can have a        paralegal prepare the letters with 
addresses.



 Kay,  Please review the attached and let me know if there are any issues.  
Thanks.
Kay,  Another CA Data Sheet check.  Thanks.
I'll be in town.  Let me know the details.  Eric may have trouble.  After the 
stunt he pulled Tuesday, the Warden's angry.

Gerald, (its Sunday and this is what I have)

Davis is going to make some changes that he and Courtney discussed yesterday 
in addition to some more equipment and project details.  He will likely do 
that tonight 
at home so we will send an updated draft in the moring.  

Defining the LLC stuff to them is not going to happen and will be removed 
from this

The Force Majuere and other sections are going to be difficult to sell to 
Eastman and
we are going to need to work on that portion tomorrow.

Have a great day.

Lal,  Attached is the form agreement that was attached as Exhibit B to the 
LLC Agreement.  

Have you reviewed the Change Order form for the Compressor and Plant?  I have 
not heard back from Andy either.  Please let me know if you have any comments.
I again reviewed the storage contracts on which large value has been 
assessed.  The Cove Point LNG, Limited Partnership and Egan Hub Partners, 
L.P. are both FERC regulated entities and both agreements have negotiated 
rates.
The Cove Point deal has a negotiated reservation charge and the Egan Hub 
Partners has a negotiated storage reservation and injection charge.  Since we 
are buying the assets of Columbia and assigning the contracts to Enron and  
these deals are at less than max rates, they would be subject to reposting 
upon assignment and there would be no guarantee that Enron would receive 
these rates in a competetive bidding situation.  It is my understanding the 
discounts were taken into account for valuation purposes, however these 
discounts are at risk due to posting requirements. 

The remainder of the storage contracts would require consents to assign.

Note: Any transport contracts with discounted rates would be subject to the 
same as above.

I am verifying the reposting requirements with Randy Rich of Bracewell & 
Patterson (FERC Counsel) and he is to get back with me early this afternoon.  
I will let you know if anything changes.

Dan,  Attached is a clean and redlined version of my changes.  As we 
discussed, the letter is now non-binding.
Tell her that I will buy her all the beer she wants if she goes to Cozumel 
with us.  Just two conditions.  Craig stays home and she rooms with me!
Dan,  Attached is a clean and redlined version of the non-binding LOI.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.
GT,   Was that an ass kicking or what?   The game look like a blast on TV.  I 
am still pissed I missed it.  

Did you get the tickets okay?  Hope so.  How was the Tailgate?  Any sweet 
sweet babies?More Coz 2000 T-shirt slogans.

Please find attached the latest draft of the proposed Capital Construction 
Term Rate Agreement with Sofregaz US.  I have not yet sent these changes back 
to Sofregaz yet.  Our (EECC) legal department approves these changes, but I 
wanted to make sure Gerald and Enron Storage Co. approved these changes.  The 
only changes made were to Section 19, General Indemnity.  This is a 
comparison copy showing the changes from our standard Capital Construction 
Agreement.

Gerald, the contract is with EECC, but Enron Storage Co. could use an 
Affiliate Work Offer.  I just realized that there is no Exhibit showing the 
Work Offer form, so I will correct that and make the work offers Exhibit F. I 
will attach a copy of our affiliate work offer for your review.

Please get back to me with any comments.  I will then reply back to Sofregaz.

In the literate world (outside of Iowa) this is a "poll",  not "pole".I was thinking about coming into Austin Friday night and driving up with you

Three problems with this Draft.

1.  In Paragraph 1.1, they removed my requirement of installing a system to 
meet "all of Enron's electrical power requirements for the Driver".  My 
concern here is that they put in equipment that is not adequate to handle our 
load requirements.  At a minimum we should state a specific load requirement 
for this station.  E.g. 10,000 HP.

2.  In Paragraph 1.1, they inserted a requirement that Plain's approve any 
in-service date for the driver and that the Telecommunication Equipment would

3.  Plains disclaims all warranties with respect to the Telecommunication

I think you should talk to their attorney directly.  Relevant points are:

1.  This is actually a 12 MW substation.  

3.  The communications are for their use only and don't really effect us 
except they might want to interrupt us when it is down.  That would of course 
be unacceptable.

Three problems with this Draft.

1.  In Paragraph 1.1, they removed my requirement of installing a system to 
meet "all of Enron's electrical power requirements for the Driver".  My 
concern here is that they put in equipment that is not adequate to handle our 
load requirements.  At a minimum we should state a specific load requirement 
for this station.  E.g. 10,000 HP.

2.  In Paragraph 1.1, they inserted a requirement that Plain's approve any 
in-service date for the driver and that the Telecommunication Equipment would 
be in-service by such date.  My draft had a date established by Enron solely 
and Plains would have to meet such date.  I think we need control of our 
in-service date without Plains prior approval.  We will be reasonable in 
establishing such date.

3.  Plains disclaims all warranties with respect to the Telecommunication

Shonnie,

I still have some outstanding questions for Texaco, all relating to Sorrento.

We need signed copies of the Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin PSC agreements and 
the BASF amendment dated 7/31/99 (there are some rate changes in this 
agreement).

In addition, I have the following questions:

* Is cavern #2 assumed start date of 7/01/2001 OK?
* Is cavern #2 assumed size of 3.2bcf OK?
* Are the following daily charges or monthly charges:
       $0.15 capacity reservation for LGS (Monthly)
       $0.1125 capacity reservation for Sabine Hub Svcs (Appears to be 
monthly,  Contract not clear)
       $0.1150 capacity reservation and $0.75 MDWQ reservation for both 
Wisconsin entities (Monthly)
* What is the currently calculated capacity reservation rate for Entergy?  
(Demand Charge of $2.42/MMBtu times the MDDQ (=100,000 MMBtu))  Adjusted in 
accordance with the FERC interest rate.)  This is a monthly charge.  This is 
the New Orleans Public Service Inc. contract info.  I believe this is the 
same as Entergy.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  

Thanks,
Greg

Gerald,

Following is additional information about pressure differentials.  As I 
understand it, we are not contractually bound to deliver to Entex through 
MidCon if we can't get into MidCon.  Consequently, charging back third-party 
costs may not be an option?  Steve Schneider (who isn't around right now) is 
probably the best source for this information.  Nonetheless, this does not 
negate the fact that we might want compensation if over time one or both of 
these interconnects prove to be useless for a prolonged period of time due to 
pressure differentials.

Let me know what you and Eric find out.  In the meantime.

Steve / Johnnie:  As stated below in Brads "e" mail the range of 
deliverability we can expect on the MidCon Texas Interconnects is between a 
minimum of 75,000 MMBtu/d and the design maximum of 100,000 MMBtu/d.  I 
believe this answers the remaining questions.  We have provided what I 
believe to be overwhelming strategic as well as financial justification to 
building these interconnects.  Now its time to shift into approval and most 
importantly immediate construction.  With the construction of these 
interconnects I believe there is a high probability of getting a 5 year 
storage deal done this year.  This would greatly reduce HPL's Spread Risk. 
(which just in the last week has resulted in approximately $3 million in 
losses).  Please let me know why we can't receive approval and begin 
construction immediately.   Please let me know why we would not be able to 
have operational by January 1, 2000.

Subject: Additional East Houston flow studies for the MidCon Texas 
Interconnect

I have run some additional flow studies for the east side of town to 
determine HPL's ability to deliver gas to MidCon Texas at the proposed 
Flagstaff interconnect.  With gas leaving Bammel at a reduced pressure of 600 
psig, HPL will only be able to deliver 74 MMCFD at around 450 psig to MidCon 
Texas, assuming the combined Equistar/Destec Channelview delivery is only 60 
MMCFD.  Increasing the Bammel pressure to 650 psig will only increase the 
deliverability to 78 MMCFD.  Therefore, it would be safe to say that with 
pressures at Bammel ranging between 600-650 psig, HPL will only be able to 
deliver around 75 MMCFD to MidCon Texas.  One of the main reasons why the 
deliverability to MidCon Texas only increases by 4 MMCFD with a 50 psig 
increase in Bammel pressure is that the increased pressure backs off gas to 
Channelview from the 12" Baytown line.  With that gas backed off, more gas 
must be supplied from the Bammel direction, using up a portion of the 
additional capacity generated by the increase of 50 psig at Bammel.  Making 
the initial assumption that no gas will flow to Channelview from the 12" 
(3018) line will only further deteriorate HPL's ability to deliver gas to 
MidCon Texas.

Subject: MidCon Texas Flagstaff Road Interconnect

I have run a flow study on the east side of HPL's Houston Loop to determine 
whether HPL can deliver 100 MMCFD to MidCon during winter peak hour 
conditions.  The interconnect pressure will be around 600 psig, which will 
allow HPL to deliver 100 MMCFD to MidCon with an 8" AAT-90 turbine meter.  
This is the full capacity of this particular 8" turbine meter.  The following 
assumptions were made in the preparation of this flow study:

1) The available gas pressure at Bammel is 900 psig.
2)  The Hardy Toll road mainline regulator is fully open, not taking any 
pressure cut.
3)  Entex being delivered gas at a peak hour rate, which is defined as HPL's 
historical peak Entex day plus 30%.
4)  The deliveries being made to both the Destec and Lyondell Channelview 
plants total no more than 60 MMCFD.

If capacity gets tight at Flagstaff, Gas Control can shut in the regulator 
from the Enerfin system to the 12" (3018) line to boost pressures.  Gas 
Control could also raise the pressure at Bammel to more closely track the 
MAOP of 936 psig on the east side of the Bammel loop.

Please note that if Bammel pressures are lower than 900 psig due to low 
inventory at Bammel, and Entex is on a peak hour delivery rate, then HPL will 
have difficulty making a 100 MMCFD delivery to MidCon Texas at Flagstaff.  
Increasing the turbine meter size to a 12" AAT-140 would solve this problem, 
but this would result in a greatly oversized measurement facility during 
normal operating periods.  A better solution would be to shut in the Enerfin 
and Maxey Road regulators to boost pressures on the east side and to attempt 
to limit Lyondell and Destec deliveries.

1.  HPL will install both meter facility to mutally agreeable specifications.
2.  HPL will own and operate the Greens Bayou Point.
3.  MidCon will own and operate the Deer Park Point.
4.  All costs to install both interconnects will be shared 50/50 by the 
Parties under a true up mechanism based on actual costs.
5.  Pressure committments by both Parties for 5 years, with failure to meet 
such committments resulting in reimbursement by the failing Party of all 
costs borne by the non-failing Party for that interconnect only at which the 
pressure committment is not met.
6.  Each Party has a right to use at all times 50% of the then available 
capacity at each interconnect, unless a Party fails to meet its pressure 
committment.

Please review.

                   BODY: 


                   Tom Hicks was beside himself. He couldn't sit in one 
place. And 
                   he couldn't stand. He couldn't even bear to watch at 
times, but 
                   the buoyant CEO and chairman of Hicks Muse Tate & Furst, 
the 
                   giant buyout firm, also couldn't afford to turn away, 
because 
                   this deal could go either way. I'm not talking about the 
                   company's pending $ 200 million bet on an Internet outfit 
called 
                   Teligent. That's pocket change to a business managing more 
than 
                   $ 11 billion in assets. This was really big. This was 
Saturday 
                   afternoons in the fall. This was perky cheerleaders flying 
                   through the air, and high-stepping marching bands. This 
was 
                   college football. This was Texas. 

                   On this autumn Saturday afternoon in Austin, the 
University of 
                   Texas Longhorns led powerful Nebraska with only a few 
minutes on 
                   the clock at Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, the 
team's 
                   newly renovated home. A win would be huge. The 
Cornhuskers, 
                   perennial national title contenders, were big-bully 
conference 
                   rivals and ranked third in the nation, while the young 
Longhorns 
                   were like clumsy calves still finding their legs under 
                   second-year coach Mack Brown. Hicks is a proud and 
generous alum 
                   (Texas Exes, they're called), and he's deep into this Hook 
'em 
                   Horns thing. Two years ago he flew athletic director 
DeLoss 
                   Dodds to North Carolina on his private plane to woo Brown 
to 
                   Austin personally, and he regularly counsels the coach on 
                   management matters. He also advised Dodds about pricing, 
                   financing, and amenities when Texas built 66 posh private 
suites 
                   at the stadium before last season. In October he hosted a 
                   charity golf tournament in Dallas during the raucous 
                   Texas-Oklahoma weekend to benefit the school's sports 
programs. 
                   He owns the Texas Rangers baseball team and the NHL Dallas 
                   Stars, but Tom Hicks loves the Texas Longhorns. 

                   So it's understandable that he was a bit on edge at the 
Nebraska 
                   game, hosting a couple of dozen friends, relatives, and 
business 
                   associates in one of the glitzy new suites high above the 
field 
                   at the Nebraska game. Wearing a Longhorn burnt-orange 
shirt and 
                   surrounded by enough ice-cream bars and shrimp to satisfy 
an 
                   offensive line, Hicks was anxious and animated. "Hey," he 
yelled, 
                   "ain't this something?" 

                   It sure is. The University of Texas athletic program is at 
a 
                   pretty intriguing place in college sports. With a surging 
young 
                   football team at its core, it is one of the most 
successful 
                   college athletic programs in the country, and I'm not just 
                   talking about wins and losses. This is a 
multimillion-dollar 
                   enterprise that operates more like a solid business than a 
                   renegade campus outfit. College sports has been a 
big-ticket 
                   dance for some time now, and this program is much like 
others at 
                   the top-tier universities, but there are a couple of 
exceptions: 
                   The folks making the moves in Austin function more like 
CEOs than 
                   like traditional athletic directors and coaches, and 
they're 
                   making it work. 

                   To determine how they do it, I went back to school this 
fall and 
                   asked to take a close look at the books. What I found was 
an 
                   operation that balances the athletic department's 
educational 
                   responsibilities with fiscal discipline at a time when the 
costs 
                   of running a big-time athletic program are surging and 
most 
                   college athletic programs are in the red. I found a place 
where 
                   football pays the bills. That was no surprise, but this 
was: 
                   Among the beneficiaries of big-time football is a women's 
sports 
                   program that could be a model for gender equity. 

                   In fact, at the University of Texas, the football 
Longhorns are 
                   Grade A cash cows. Athletics officials credit the team 
with 
                   generating a staggering 80% of the department's $ 45.3 
million 
                   from revenues in 1999. That's $ 36 million from tickets, 
                   individual donations, rights fees, sponsorships, hot dogs, 
beer, 
                   and other sources. 

                   The athletic department operates much like a 
self-contained 
                   corporation, separate and apart from the rest of the 
university. 
                   It has its core business (football); various auxiliary 
operations 
                   (other men's and women's teams); numerous revenue streams; 
                   traditional corporate functions such as finance, 
marketing, 
                   public relations, and HR (you know it as recruiting); and 
even 
                   sophisticated satellite offices--dozens of alumni chapters 
                   nationwide, through which athletics targets some 400,000 
Texas 
                   Exes for private gifts. Got shareholders? You bet. More 
than 
                   80,000 of them meet in the stadium in Austin on Saturdays 
in the 
                   fall, and they grade every move Mack Brown makes. Think 
chasing 
                   quarterly expectations is brutal? Try putting the success 
of your 
                   company in the hands of a bunch of 18- to 22-year-olds. 
Hate 
                   talking to analysts? Try answering Buck from Muleshoe, 
Texas, on 
                   a weekly call-in talk show after losing a 23-point lead in 
the 
                   fourth quarter. 

                   Of course, the whole thing is complicated by the fact that 
while 
                   a major-college athletic program must be managed with the 
                   diligence of a public company, athletic directors don't 
have the 
                   luxury of shutting down unprofitable businesses--at most 
schools 
                   that would be every sport save football and men's 
basketball. And 
                   those well-paid football coaches, quite simply, must win. 
"If we 
                   were a business, we wouldn't have any sport but football, 
and we 
                   would generate a heck of a profit," says Dodds, who is 
among the 
                   nation's most respected athletic directors. "But we're not 
about 
                   that. We take the money we generate from football and use 
it to 
                   provide opportunities for other kids. Then we try to 
balance what 
                   we want to accomplish inside the institution with what 
folks 
                   outside the institution want us to do. It's a hard thing 
to do." 

                   For more than a quarter-century, one of the most difficult 
                   challenges for college sports has been finding a place for 
women. 
                   You've probably heard of Title IX, the historic clause in 
the 
                   Education Amendments Act of 1972 that turned college 
sports on 
                   its ear by requiring athletic programs to offer equality 
for 
                   women in participation, scholarship allocation, 
recruitment 
                   spending, and coaching resources. The requirement forced 
athletic 
                   departments to essentially double their operations, which 
helped 
                   spark the overall growth in college sports. So whatever 
you think 
                   about the emphasis on college football, hey, it pays for 
women's 
                   soccer, okay? 

                   The Texas athletic department's budget is among the 
largest in 
                   the nation--$ 41.2 million for fiscal 1999, which ended in 
                   August. Only four universities had fatter sports wallets 
that 
                   year: Wisconsin ($ 41.4 million), Tennessee ($ 45 
million), 
                   Michigan ($ 47.6 million), and Ohio State, No. 1 by far 
with a 
                   whopping $ 64.9 million athletics budget. (If you think 
those who 
                   spend the most win, forget it: OSU is the only school of 
the 
                   group not ranked in the latest Top 25 AP football poll.) 

                   How does UT get to its number? For starters, ticket sales 
and 
                   game guarantees (payments to UT by a host school when the 
                   Longhorns play on the road) generated $ 10.1 million in 
revenue 
                   last year. That category was exceeded only by private 
gifts, 
                   which totaled an impressive $ 21 million. Other 
significant 
                   income categories included suite-lease revenue ($ 3.2 
million), 
                   television money ($ 3.9 million), payment for the team's 
Cotton 
                   Bowl appearance ($ 866,842), optional student fees ($ 
570,000), 
                   sponsorships and advertising ($ 400,000), licensing 
revenue 
                   ($ 300,000), and concessions ($ 750,000). All told, the 
department 
                   generated $ 45.4 million in 1999. 

                   The athletic department's expenses totaled $ 50.1 million. 
That 
                   included scholarships valued at $ 2.8 million for 226 men 
and 186 
                   women, administrative costs ($ 1.4 million) for about 230 
                   employees, and equipment purchases ($ 2.4 million). The 
costs of 
                   running individual teams ranged from $ 7.5 million for 
football to 
                   $ 370,000 for tennis. 

                   What caused the shortfall? The final bills for a two-year, 
$ 93 
                   million capital improvement effort. Remarkably, the 
athletic 
                   department completed the project without a penny from the 
                   university's academic funds. It raised more than $ 31 
million in 
                   private donations in just over two years. The department 
also 
                   took out $ 48 million in bonds (serviced now by lease and 
ticket 
                   revenues). The bill was closed with $ 14 million from the 
                   university's Parking and Traffic division to fund a 
parking 
                   garage. So what can you get for $ 93 million? Take a 
stroll down 
                   East Campus Drive near the stadium, and you'll pass the 
spiffy 
                   new $ 28 million Mike A. Myers Stadium and Soccer Field. 
One block 
                   over is maybe the nicest football practice facility in the 
                   country, the newly renovated Denius Athletic Fields ($ 2.5 
                   million). It was subsidized by 82-year-old World War II 
veteran 
                   Frank A. Denius, a longtime fan who has attended practices 
most 
                   every day for as long as anyone can remember. 

                   Beyond the 66 suites at Royal-Memorial stadium, UT added 
nearly 
                   7,000 new seats, renovated major sections on both sides of 
the 
                   76-year-old facility, and lowered the field three feet. 
Why lower 
                   the field, you ask? I did too. Better sightlines, of 
course. The 
                   stadium renovations cost $ 55 million--$ 3.2 million to 
lower the 
                   field alone! The department also spruced up its main 
offices, now 
                   known as the Moncrief-Neuhaus Complex. (If you've got an 
extra 
                   million, you can get your name slapped on just about 
anything.) 
                   The place is Four Seasons plush. There's an impressive 
academic 
                   support center stocked with computers, a hangar-sized 
weight room 
                   that could inspire a couch potato, and an over-the-top 
football 
                   locker room any NFL team would envy--custom-carved 
benches, 
                   original art, and lockers the size of small Manhattan 
apartments. 
                   Mack Brown's spacious office, with a picture window 
overlooking 
                   the stadium field, is trimmed in warm cherrywood and 
decorated 
                   with mementos and collectibles, including a case of 
watches 
                   commemorating universities and bowl games where he has 
coached 
                   during his 24-year career. Photos from the Longhorn 
archives line 
                   the hallways, and display cases in the lobby house the 
school's 
                   three national championship trophies (1963, '69, and '70) 
and the 
                   1977 Heisman Trophy, won by the man who is still the most 
                   powerful and exciting running back in college football 
history, 
                   former Longhorn Earl Campbell. Check out the intricate, 
                   hand-carved leather saddles in the cavernous players' 
lounge. 
                   Yep, you can sit on the saddles and watch games. 

                   If it all seems impossibly lavish, there are reasons. The 
stadium 
                   upgrade generates new revenue, and the school had to build 
new 
                   facilities for its women's programs under requirements 
outlined 
                   in Title IX. But perhaps the most vital reason is 
recruiting. "We 
                   had to stay sexy and attractive to the kids," says Ed 
Goble, UT's 
                   vice president of business affairs. "You've got to provide 
an 
                   enhanced experience on campus to compete for the best 
kids." 

                   CEO and COO would be more appropriate titles for Dodds and 
Brown, 
                   the UT athletic director and head football coach. Dodds, a 
                   62-year-old former track coach, got into sports 
administration 
                   because he liked working with coaches. Today he has an 
associate 
                   athletic director who handles those duties. Dodds is too 
busy 
                   closing new sponsorship deals, negotiating Big 12 
Conference 
                   television and radio contracts, glad-handing with 
boosters, 
                   serving on NCAA committees, and promoting his 
self-described 
                   "passion"--a college football championship tournament. 
Dodds 
                   believes critics of a post-season tournament for college 
                   football--the only major sport without a legitimate 
championship 
                   tournament--are, after years of debate, softening. If it 
were to 
                   happen, it would have to be approved within the next 18 
months, 
                   says Dodds, a "window" before negotiations for the next 
round of 
                   network television contracts kick into gear. Dodds thinks 
a 
                   college football championship would generate about $ 2 
million for 
                   each of the 120 or so schools playing Division I-A 
football. "I 
                   think that over a seven-year period a football playoff is 
worth 
                   several billion," he says. 

                   In the grand scheme of the college sports industry, $ 2 
million 
                   may not seem like much, but Dodds knows well that success 
comes 
                   with a price. After last season, when Brown took the 
Longhorns to 
                   a post-season bowl for the first time since 1990, Dodds 
ripped up 
                   the coach's original contract and signed him to a new 
ten-year 
                   deal worth $ 1 million annually. He added an annuity, 
largely 
                   funded by private donors, that will give Brown $ 1 million 
                   annually at age 60 should he remain another four years. 

                   By the way, Brown does earn more than the university 
president, 
                   Dr. Larry R. Faulkner, whose salary is $ 319,400. So does 
                   basketball coach Rick Barnes, who earns $ 750,000. But if 
you're 
                   looking for the sort of acrimony between sports and 
academics 
                   that tears so many schools apart, you won't find much of 
it here. 
                   "I have a lot of respect for Dodds, his inventiveness, and 
his 
                   way of keeping the organization attuned to opportunities," 
says 
                   Faulkner. "I've certainly paid attention to that." 

                   The football coach actually gets to "coach" about as much 
as Bill 
                   Gates gets to play videogames these days. His nine 
assistants 
                   structure and manage practices and deal with most routine 
player 
                   matters. Brown, like any top-level executive, is expected 
to be 
                   the company's outside guy. He's your COO with a whistle. 
Most of 
                   his hours are filled with media obligations (about two 
dozen 
                   television and radio stations and newspapers cover the 
                   Longhorns), fundraising (for the entire university as well 
as the 
                   athletic department), and trying to keep his own 
management team 
                   in place. (After last season, seven of his assistant 
coaches were 
                   offered head coaching jobs elsewhere; Brown kept them all, 
adding 
                   $ 250,000 to the department's payroll. Additionally, five 
coaches 
                   were granted annuities worth $ 50,000 to $ 60,000 at age 
60 if they 
                   hang on with Brown for four more years.) 

                   On occasion, Brown also telephones one of the many 
corporate 
                   executives who are big UT boosters, guys like Hicks and 
San 
                   Antonio car dealer Red McCombs, another alum and the owner 
of the 
                   NFL's Minnesota Vikings. Brown looks to Hicks for 
time-management 
                   advice and insights on coping with pressure. With McCombs 
he 
                   talks talent and tries to absorb some of the owner's 
upbeat 
                   attitude. ("Hey, you're talking to one of only two owners 
who're 
                   going to the Super Bowl," McCombs told Brown after an 
                   early-season Longhorn loss. At the time, the Vikings were 
1-2). 
                   "One of the things that's common in both of them is that 
they're 
                   high energy," says Brown. "They have the ability to dream, 
they 
                   have a lot of imagination, and they don't get down very 
much." In 
                   some areas, though, Brown is on his own. "The difference 
between 
                   their business and ours is that they can hire and fire who 
they 
                   want to," the coach said one October afternoon while 
lounging on 
                   one of the plush leather couches in his office. "In my 
business, 
                   we put our paychecks in the mouths of 18- to 22-year-olds 
we 
                   can't fire. It's like that ugly-baby theory--we can't get 
rid of 
                   them. So we have to hug them and teach them better. 
Another 
                   thing--CEOs don't have to deal with mothers. The major 
difference 
                   for us is the kids." 

                   Brown's kids were whooping it up with 80,000-plus Longhorn 
                   faithful on that October afternoon when the pop of the 
final gun 
                   signaled the end of the Nebraska game. Final score: Texas 
24, 
                   Nebraska 20. The victory was a turning point for the young 
                   Longhorns that propelled them to their finest season in 
years. 
                   Going into their last regular-season game against Texas 
A&M, the 
                   Longhorns have their best record (9-2) since winning ten 
games in 
                   1995--albeit one that ended in an atmosphere of tragedy. A 
week 
                   before the game 12 students were killed and 28 injured on 
the A&M 
                   campus while building a huge bonfire structure for a 
pregame 
                   rally. As FORTUNE went to press the game was scheduled to 
be 
                   played. 

                   This year the Longhorns have been ranked as high as sixth 
in the 
                   AP Top 25, their highest perch since 1996. Their reward? A 
                   possible trip to the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl in January, a 
                   prestigious bowl game despite its name. Each team in the 
game 
                   receives $ 1.5 million. To put it another way, the 
Nebraska 
                   victory paid off for the Longhorns like an Internet IPO. 
So 
                   while Dodds appeared calm amid the post-game celebrations, 
he 
                   was actually more relieved than anything. "If you don't 
win, 
                   you're not doing your job," he said. "And you don't 
survive." 

                   There have been times of real doubt in recent years at UT 
                   athletics as the program struggled to find its way back to 
                   football prominence in the '90s. But perhaps the most 
                   significant crisis occurred in 1992, when seven female 
athletes 
                   filed a lawsuit against the university charging that it 
had 
                   failed to comply with Title IX. When the suit was filed, 
about 
                   37% of UT's varsity athletes were women, and female 
athletes 
                   received about $ 1 million in scholarships, well short of 
the 
                   $ 2.8 million awarded to male varsity athletes. Some 
executives 
                   inside the department wanted to fight the charges. Recalls 
Jody 
                   Conradt, UT's women's athletic director and head coach of 
                   women's basketball: "Some folks said, 'Let's have a final 
war 
                   right here on the University of Texas campus, and let's 
just see 
                   who's right!' Thankfully, DeLoss and others said, 'That's 
not 
                   the way. We need to sit down and come up with a solution. 
" Just 
                   three days after negotiations began, the university 
settled, 
                   essentially agreeing to all demands. Today, 43% of the 
                   department's scholarship dollars are spent for female 
athletes, 
                   who represent 43.7% of UT's athletes. 

                   Dodds believes that if the esteemed founders of college 
sports 
                   had not spurned female athletes from the start, then the 
industry 
                   would not have endured the turmoil that ruling ignited. 
                   "Somebody, somewhere, made a big mistake," he says. 
"Somebody, 
                   somewhere, decided women didn't need to be in sports, and 
I don't 
                   know why we weren't smart enough to fix it sooner." 

                   The person most credited with nudging--some say 
shoving--Texas in 
                   the right direction on gender equity is Donna Lopiano, a 
longtime 
                   activist for equity for women in sports and now head of 
the 
                   Women's Sports Foundation. She became women's athletic 
director 
                   at the University of Texas in 1975, the first woman in the 
                   country to hold an AD title at a major university. Like 
many 
                   advocates for gender equity, she felt the university was 
dragging 
                   toward Title IX compliance, but as a university official 
she 
                   could not openly encourage students to challenge the 
university. 
                   Instead she handed out Title IX manuals and complaint 
forms from 
                   boxes she stashed behind her desk like candy at Halloween. 
"Must 
                   have done it hundreds of times, for 17 years," she says, 
laughing 
                   at the memory. "I had boxes of manuals and more boxes to 
replace 
                   them. I couldn't believe it when somebody finally did it." 
By 
                   "it," she means filed suit. 

                   "It took someone to be abrasive, pushy, and all the other 
                   adjectives her friends use for Donna," says Conradt. 
"Donna 
                   scares people. It wouldn't have happened any other way. No 
                   question, she's the most significant individual for what 
we've 
                   been able to achieve in women's athletics." 

                   Today women's athletics at UT has its own corporate 
structure 
                   and hierarchy. It shares resources with the men in many 
areas, 
                   but it has its own management team, led by Conradt, who, 
like 
                   Dodds, reports to university vice president Pat Ohlendorf. 
Only 
                   a handful of Division I programs are similarly structured. 
"I 
                   think young women need to see women as bosses," Conradt 
says. 
                   "If the [men's and women's] departments merged, how would 
women 
                   get the chance to run any of the areas? This way we have 
role 
                   models for student athletes." 

                   The women still have a long way to go before reaching 
parity in 
                   one critical area--fundraising. Last year gifts received 
by 
                   women's sports totaled only $ 250,000. But the women are 
not 
                   without their boosters, Red McCombs being the biggest. Two 
events 
                   led McCombs to an epiphany regarding women's sports. One 
came 
                   during what he described as a "good ol' Bubba" meeting 
about 
                   fundraising a few years back. When he asked the lone woman 
in the 
                   room to name the most generous donors for women's 
athletics, he 
                   recalls, "She looked at me like I was crazy and said, 'Mr. 
                   McCombs, there are none.'" 

                   Soon afterward, McCombs' young granddaughter told him that 
she 
                   could not find a girls' softball team to join. He realized 
that 
                   wasn't going to change as long as the woman in the good 
ol' Bubba 
                   meeting was right. So four years ago he wrote a check for 
$ 3 
                   million to the UT women's athletic program, the largest 
single 
                   gift to women's collegiate sports anyone can recall. 
Earlier this 
                   year the Red and Charline McCombs Softball Stadium opened 
on UT's 
                   campus. 

                   Title IX clearly stoked the growth in college sports 
programs a 
                   quarter-century ago, but where will the money come from to 
                   sustain future growth? There's at least some concern that 
college 
                   sports is already locked squarely in corporate America's 
cross 
                   hairs as the next sports-marketing frontier. For years 
only the 
                   likes of Nike, Reebok, and other sports brands had major 
deals 
                   with college teams. Now high-tech companies like eBay and 
Nextel 
                   are lining up alongside soft-drink, financial-services, 
and 
                   entertainment companies to sell their products and 
services to 
                   your kids. Companies once worried about being called crass 
for 
                   slapping logos on college campuses. Today there is no 
shame. Take 
                   the annual Texas-Oklahoma game, the meeting of two of the 
most 
                   celebrated rivals in college football history. For two 
years now 
                   it has been called the Dr Pepper Red River Shootout, also 
                   sponsored by Southwestern Bell, Mercedes-Benz, Bank of 
America, 
                   Miller Brewing, and the Texas Land & Cattle Co., a local 
                   restaurant chain. It's worth in excess of $ 100,000 to 
each 
                   school. Be very afraid. 

                   For now, corporate deals remain only a minor revenue 
source for 
                   most big colleges. But as TV money and ticket prices peak, 
and 
                   donors get short arms and can't reach their wallets (after 
a 
                   couple of dog seasons, you'll see what I mean), it could 
become 
                   the most vital source of future growth. Texas' new deal 
with 
                   Nike, for instance, provides UT athletics with up to $ 1.8 
million 
                   in Nike gear, along with $ 850,000 in cash annually for 
the next 
                   nine years. That's equal to the largest sponsorship deal 
in 
                   college sports, and more than twice the value of the 
department's 
                   previous contract with Reebok. 

                   While Dodds is mindful of the need to maintain some 
boundaries 
                   against unbridled commercialism, he's more concerned that 
some 
                   major college programs may be forced out of big-time 
football 
                   altogether because they can't keep up with escalating 
costs. 
                   Sometimes the scale of all this makes Dodds wistful. "What 
I'd 
                   like to do is maybe start over with this whole thing," he 
says, 
                   "because it's gotten to the point where you don't control 
it, you 
                   manage it, and it's a challenge." 

                   Nevertheless: Texas is banking on being a leader in 
e-commerce 
                   for college sports. Sales through its nascent Website are 
almost 
                   nil. But with nearly a half-million Texas Exes out 
here--and 
                   Longhorn football on a roll--the upside is vast. Hook 'em, 
iHorns? 

                   On that Saturday afternoon in the fall when the Longhorns 
grew 
                   up against Nebraska, an elderly fan in dark glasses sat 
quietly 
                   on the front row of a luxury box at the stadium named in 
his 
                   honor. Darrell Royal is still greeted as "Coach Royal" 
around 
                   Austin. He's in awe of his surroundings, amazed that the 
program 
                   he helped build has become a multimillion-dollar 
operation. He 
                   never had to raise funds as a coach, never had to do 
anything 
                   but coach--and, well, fix the place up a bit. "When I 
first got 
                   here in 1954, there was a broken-down old shack in the end 
                   zone," he says. "Caretaker lived there. It took a few 
years, but 
                   we finally got it torn down." He laughed at another 
                   recollection: He couldn't understand why fans refused to 
sit in 
                   an upper section of the stadium until he ventured up and 
                   realized that there were no bathrooms up there. 

                   Coach Royal doesn't much bother Dodds with advice anymore, 
though 
                   he did mention one thing a while back: "I told him, 
'Nothing 
                   makes Texans as happy as winning, and it's happy folks 
that 
                   give.'" Like any good executive, Dodds listened well.

the assets we are financing, if we are concerned about these guys being a 
credit risk.  We did this with the MTG deal.  I have a form of mortgage 
agreement which works with this type of deal.  I would guess credit needs to 
make that call.  Let me know if you want the form.

Dan,
 Please check the revised agreement to see that I have included all that is 
necessary.  Since Quantum is doing the work for themselves, I did not include 
the Construction Agreement.  Please call if you have any questions.  I will 
forward to Gerald to see if he thinks I need to include any other items.  


Attached is the form of amendment to the Dow Brining and Cavern Lease 
Agreement.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

GeraldNothing planned for Sat.  

My home phone is (713) 942-8066 and my cell is (281) 772-9250.  Give me a 
call and let's try and hook up.  Attached is a clean and redlined versions of the Gateway and Rio Nogales with 
the revisions we discussed.  Please review and if acceptable, please forward 
to Pace.  Merry Christmas.


Dan,  Attached is the form.  It references the agreement we are lending the 
money under (and Events of Default thereunder) and also needs to have 
exhibits prepared.  We probably also should check to see if there are any 
existing Security Interest in these assets.  The ones we know that we are 
subordinate to should be noted in the mortgage.  Shonnie has a contact in 
Wyoming she has used before to search the county records for any existing 
security interest.
Dan,  Please review.  I will be in tommorrow morning and we can discuss and 
changes needed.
You have probably done this already, but remove any reference to SCADA in the 
Alstom agreement.

COMPRESSION SERVICES COMPANY (the "Agreement").

Enron Compression Services Company (ECS) has an agreement with Planergy by 
which ECS and Planergy share in the energy savings from the certain equipment 
at the new Bammel compression station.  The Agreement states that we "...will 
forward the recorded hours of operation for the previous month to Planergy 
within (15) days of the 1st day of the month."  We are currently working with 
Planergy and the Bammel team to design the report that will track the hours 
of use for the subject equipment.  

I would like to suggest that the Bammel team fax the recorded hours before 
the 15th day of the following month to those listed below:

Cheryl Marshall (Asset Management)- fax 713-646-8416
Carol Carter (ECS accounting) - fax 713-646-3084
Roger Roedick (Planergy) - fax 713-468-1457

If anyone disagrees with this idea, please call Cheryl at 713-853-6250.

Subject: Millennium Pipeline Precedent Agreement

As part of Enron's acquisition of the wholesale unit of Columbia Energy 
Services, Enron North America has a Precedent Agreement with the Millennium 
Pipeline project.  The Precedent Agreement contains termination clauses that 
are date certain for January 14, 2000.  These clauses have been extended 
numerous times in the past.  The PA also contains a clause that gives Enron 
the right to terminate the agreement if FERC's Order regarding Millennium's 
Certificate Application is not satisfactory and acceptable to Enron.  The 
FERC has not acted upon Millennium's Certificate Application.  The PA also 
includes an "exclusivity" clause (Section 3.4) that we would like clarified 
in conjunction with extending the dates in the agreement.  Millennium would 
like to clarify the "exclusivity" clause in an interpretive letter, rather 
than eliminate the language from the PA.  Millennium claims that if they 
eliminate the language for Enron, they would have to do the same for other 
shippers.  Therefore, we would like to remove the ambiguity of the 
"exclusivity" clause and clarify Enron's rights through the interpretive 
letter.  If we cannot agree on the interpretive letter language, then we can 
still exercise the right to terminate the PA by deeming the FERC Order 
unacceptable.  The following is the language of the "exclusivity" clause, a 
rough cut that I have made for language in the interpretive letter and the 
clause pertaining to the FERC Order.  Could you please give me your thoughts 
on the interpretive letter.  We can then send the letter to the pipeline for 
signature by both Enron North America and Millennium.

Exclusivity Clause

Section 3.4  This Agreement shall constitute the exclusive agreement by which 
Shipper shall seek to obtain a firm natural gas transportation service with 
respect to Shipper's MDQ, except for agreements pursuant to which Shipper 
contracts for the transportation of its MDQ to and from the Millennium 
Project.

Interpretive Letter

Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 3.4 of the Millennium Pipeline 
Project Precedent Agreement between the sponsors of the Millennium Pipeline 
Project and Enron North America ("Shipper"), as successor to Columbia Energy 
Services, Shipper is not precluded from obtaining firm or interruptible 
natural gas transportation services on any interstate pipeline offering 
services similar to the Millennium Pipeline.

FERC Order Clause

Section 5.1  If the FERC's order regarding Millennium's Certificate 
Application is not satisfactory and acceptable to Shipper in its sole 
discretion, then Shipper may terminate this Agreement by giving Millennium 
notice thereof within fifteen (15) days after the date of issuance of the 
FERC's order.  In the event that Millennium fails to receive approval of this 
Agreement from its Management Committee, to the extent required, Millennium 
may terminate this Agreement by giving Shipper fifteen (15) days prior notice.

Pat,  Please print out the attached documents for me.  Thanks.

Subject: Agreement to Upgrade and Operate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities



Dear Gerald:

In accordance with our conversation of yesterday regarding the Agreement
to Upgrade and Operate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities (the "Upgrade
Agreement") I have reviewed the documents and investigated the location
of the metering station; the results are as follows:

* The existing sales contract provides quality and pressure
obligations.
* The existing sales contract provides for measurement of the gas.
* The existing sales contract provides for noncompliance with
quality obligations.
* As you indicated, the existing sales contract provides you have
no obligation to odorize the gas.
* The existing sales contract provides for the installation of
meters by Enron.  Part of the metering equipment was replaced under the
existing sales contract pursuant to an amendment (I will be pleased to
provide you a copy if you wish).
* The existing sales contract states that HTI is responsible for
all taxes except specifically excluded taxes; taxes measured by net
income are in the list of excluded taxes.
* The HPL Facilities are on property owned by HTI.  Accordingly,
company policy dictates that any subcontractor coming on HTI premises
must carry certain types of insurance that provides for certain
endorsements.  A sample provision is attached to this message.

On the basis of the meeting held in our offices on Monday with
representatives of your company, Niels Udengaard, our Vice President,
was under the impression that the Upgrade Agreement was no longer
required.  We are prepared to handle the matter in the manner formerly
used to replace metering equipment.

Please let me have your comments.

Sincerely,
Haldor Topsoe, Inc.

Kay,  Please review the attached.  Thanks.
Brad,  Please reviewed the attached before we send to MidCon for their 
review.  Pay particular attention to the pressure committment sections. 
Thanks.
Steve,  Let's take out the reference to approaching the FERC in this letter.  
I would emphasize that they have had more than enough time for a response and 
while we would like to think they are cooperating, the lack of response 
little reason to believe otherwise.  Suggest that any further delay would 
require us to explore all our options for access into CMS.

At this point I would feel more comfortable with suggesting we would need to 
go to FERC via a phone conversation with CMS.   Let me know if you want to 
discuss this further.

Hi Ryan,

I'm at DEMA right now setting up all of this year's dive trips!  I got a
message from my office mates saying they had to box me up and move me to a
temporary office in the Woodlands.  We have to make room for the HR people,
but there isn't any room for us downtown yet.

The three of you guys can just show up at the HammerHeads meeting.  There
should be a reserved section somewhere.  We normally have a few beers and
talk about dive stuff.  There will probably be lots of pictures from the
small group trip to Belize in October.  Also, Kennie and I will be going over

Can you forward Eric's email to me?  Whatever I have written down is

GT,   That sounds great on the house. What are you remodeling?  The carpet 
and kitchen?  

I have been out chasing some myself.   It is amazing how may screwed women 
there are out there.  Some good looking ones though.

I am out of town the next couple of weekends, but some time after that would 
be good.  Early February around the 12th or any time thereafter.  Sounds like 
you are going to be busy moving in the house during that time also.  Let me

1.  No values for the 401K's are in the sheet.   Blank at this time.
2.  The blue values can be changed and the sheet should adjust accordingly.
3.  Please review the calculations behind the cells to understand how I am

If you want to sit down and go over this together at your convenience, I

Randy,

I'd like to speak with you this morning.  I'm having Gerald research Texas 
law on: (i) failure of conditions precedent resulting in failure to form a 
contract  and (ii) breach of contract sufficient to afford termination as a 
remedy for breach.  Any help you can offer today in your shop on these 2 
issues would be appreciated.  Our guys want to issue a termination notice as 
soon as possible.  I want to know what common law of contract says before we 
do.  

Call me when you get a chance.

Steve


The docs should be with Carolyn Gilley in Contract Records.
Kay, Could you pull and send me copies of any Confidentiality Agreements any 
Enron entities have with the following companies:

Bay Gas Storage
Energy South

Not sure what type of entities they are.  Let me know if you need any further 
information.  Thanks for your help.By the time of this meeting, I will be about $10,000 richer with a 6 ft. tall 
half-clothed showgirl on each arm.  So please send Kristi my greetings!    
When upon learning I will not be in attendance, she goes into a deep state of 
depression, inform her that she had her chance and that ship has sailed.

OK, I will reconsider, but only if she grovels.

Lets skin that smoke wagon!I noticed that there was one bio missing.  So here goes,

Eric Gillaspie:  28 Junior Attorney extradonaire for Enron North America, 
wannabe Rock-n-Roll star.  Prone to performing at least one incredibly 
embarassing act every time he goes out drinking including, but not limited 
to, falling down in bars, kicking people on the dance floor with his 
incredibly gay dance steps, and lapsing into siezures resulting in the 
tossing of a full Gin&Tonic on senior attorneys.  Often mistaken for the cute 
little guy in the movie "Jerry Maguire" (Dogs and Bees can smell fear) not 
only because of his looks, but also his level of speech and depth of 
conversation.  Thinks the Rolling Stones stole all of their best material 
from BuckCherry and finally, "Our  dive captain".

Las Vegas was alot of fun.  The weather was awesome.  In the 60s with clear

Yes, a friend of mine from Enron is moving back to Houston from Portland, so 
this is working out great.  Very close to getting the divorce finalized.  
Should be done in a week or two.  Talk to you later and hope all finds you

Hi Gerald,      How's it going?  Fine I hope. We are all O.K. It"s been cold
the last few days. So you are going to have a roommate.  That ought to help
you out a lot, plus you"ll have some company. I heard you went to Las Vegas
over the weekend. Did you have fun. How much did you win .  Was the weather
cold or not. Talked to Paul Saturday and he said you went there. So is there
any progress on your divorce or not. Let us know what is happening. Well all

Subject: Longhorn Jeopardy!


I hope you guys caught the OU/Texas game on Big Monday last night - the
Sooners handed Texas their worst loss of the year.  In keeping with that
theme:

This is the transcript of a recent episode of Jeopardy!

COMMENTATOR: Welcome to Longhorn Jeopardy! And the host of Longhorn
Jeopardy, here's Alex Trebek.

(Applause).

ALEX: Thank you. And let's welcome our contestants, Connie, Tom and Gary.
You all know how the game's played.
So let's take a look at our Longhorn Jeopardy categories: Egyptian Art,
Has-Been College Football Dynasties, U.S. Foreign Policy, Famous Con Men,
Greek Mythology, Hilarious Sports Excuses, Recruiting Experts, and Diet
Fads.
Connie, you're our defending champion, so you control the board.

CONNIE: Alex, Has-Been College Football Dynasties for $200.

ALEX: The answer is...This football program hasn't won a national
championship in 30 years, and hasn't had a top 10 finish in 17 years, but
their fans think they're on par with Florida State and Penn State...Connie.

CONNIE: What is Oklahoma?

ALEX: No. Tom?

TOM: What is Texas?

ALEX: Correct. The Longhorns' last national title in the final AP poll was
in 1969, and last top 10 finish was in 1983. Tom, you control the board.

TOM: Let's stay with Has-Been College Football Dynasties for $600.

ALEX: The answer is...This football program bills itself as a national title
contender for the 2000 season, yet is coming off a three-game losing streak
and hasn't scored an offensive touchdown in its last 10 quarters...Gary.

GARY: What is Texas?

ALEX: Yes, Texas. I could see all of you buzzed in very quickly, but Gary
barely got in there first. Remember, the Longhorns offense didn't score a
touchdown in the last half of the A&M game, and all of the Nebraska and
Arkansas debacles. Gary, you control.

GARY: Alex, let's try Famous Con Men for $800.

ALEX: The answer is...This American made outlandish promises to his blind
followers, selling them a bill of goods and leading them to believe
prosperity
was around the corner...Gary?

GARY: Who was David Koresh?

ALEX: No...Connie?

CONNIE: Who was Jim Jones?

ALEX: No.

(Long pause). BOOP-BOOP!

ALEX: The answer is, Who was Mack Brown? Mack Brown, the Texas football
coach. I can tell the way you're hitting your hand on your head and nodding,
that's something you should have known. Just remember, contestants, it's
good advice to go with your first instinct. Gary, you still control.

GARY: Alex, Recruiting Experts for $400.

ALEX: The answer is...His football recruiting lists always excite fans in
the Hill Country, but the majority fail to live up to the hype...Gary?

GARY: Who is the Amazing Kreskin?

ALEX: No. Connie?

CONNIE: Who is Bobby Burton?

ALEX: Yes. Bobby Burton, the man who never met a UT commitment he couldn't
over-hype. Connie, you control.
CONNIE: Hilarious Sports Excuses for $600.

(WOO-WOO!)

ALEX: The Daily Double! Connie, you have $400. How much will you wager?

CONNIE: I'll risk all of it, Alex.

ALEX: All of it, OK. The answer is...Mack Brown blamed this on a College
Station hotel for UT's loss to Texas A&M.

CONNIE: What is no strawberry cream cheese for the breakfast bagels,
and...(dramatic pause) lukewarm orange juice?

ALEX: Correct! Both were blamed for the Longhorns' 20-16 loss. We'll be back
to meet the contestants right after this.

Thanks for the greeting card.  I am not sure if the guy mooning me meant 
something, but I will take it in a humorous manner.  

Remember,  Be strong and confident.

Gerald (G$)  Attached is a draft for your review.  Please review and lets discuss any 
comments.

  After re-reading the purchase and gathering agreement, I think the 
amendments should work in their present form.  The 2,500 Western gas needs to 
be noted as an exception on Exhibits A of both Agreements.   Exception should 
read "Up to the first 2,500 mmbtu/day of production from the Caballo Area 
shall be delivered to Western.... with ENA  (or EMS as applicable for the 
agreement) receiving all volumes in excess of such 2,500 mmbtu/day.  Any 
decline in the Caballo Area production shall apply ratably between Western's 
2,500 mmbtu/day and ENA's (or EMS as applicable for the agreement) production 
levels."



I got my mind on my money and my money on my mind.Attached are the latest revisions.  The Compression Admin. Agreement includes 
a clean and redlined version.  Please review.
Thanks for the note.  Hope you and Will have a wonderful Valentines Day.

 2.  Amendment to Compressor Services Agreement (Bisti)
 3.  Amendment to Operation and Maintenance Agreement (Bloomfield)

afternoon, it would be extremely helpful.  Thanks for your attention to this 
matter
Nice job on the photos.   Really makes me realize how drunk I was at certain 
times.  The good thing is that the "Dude" I met in Joe's and I are now pen

Subject: CPS Interconnect Agreement

I have talked to Dan McWhirter with CPS and the agreement needs to altered to 
reflect the following, as needed.  HPL will construct a tap, tap valve, 
riser, and check valve off the South Texas 30" JV pipeline, with EFM and 
SCADA equipment on the meter facilities.  We will own, operate and maintain 
such facilities , but will be reimbursed (with IRS tax gross-up) by CPS.  
Ownership will break at the outlet flange of the check valve, plus the EFM 
and SCADA equipment.  CPS will construct and own the remainder of the 
facilities installed, such facilities to the outlet flange of the separation 
facilities (including tank and secondary containment)  being installed to 
HPL's specs.  HPL will operate and maintain these facilities.  Our EFM will 
be custody transfer, with their EFM being check measurement.  Such facilities 
are to be installed so that HPL remotely controls the volume flow through the 
meter.  All maintenance costs on this sector will be paid by HPL and 
reimbursed by CPS upon invoice.  Any maintenance expenditure over $3,000 per 
event will require pre-notification to CPS.  All other facilities downstream 
of separation with be constructed, owned, operated and maintained by CPS.  As 
compensation for handling the separation facilities and liquids recovered, 
CPS pre-transfers ownership and title to such recovered liquids to HPL and 
warrants title to HPL.  Jim Haden will provide a revised Exhibit A depicting 
the facilities and the ownership break point.  Jim, you need to review and 
approve the facilities to be installed above to our specifications, as 
required.  If you have any questions, please call.


It is all about drinking with you isn't it?  You need to get a grip.   I will 
have to pass on the Rudz Suds as I will be dining at one of Houston's finer 
eateries with captains of industry tonight.  However, Eric and I were kicking 
around a possible road trip to the beautiful island of Galveston this 
weekend.  Saturday or Sunday? Think that nice friend of yours, Willis, might 
be interested? 

Please respond appropriately with your level of interest!  Just to anticipate 
the tone of your response, I will go ahead and call you a "Smart Ass" right 
now.

Upon reading the e:mail message shown below, I immediatedly went to 
Start/Programs/Infobasis and I found no WINFASTER application.  The 
applications that were available were Croporate Workbook 3.0c & 4.1, 
Disclosure, Enron Corporate Datasheets, Gas and Power Daily Web Page and 
Phone Book.

Given that I requested and Joya Davis processed the request for the FASTR 
Database for me, Gerald Nemec and Shonnie Daniel in early January, it is 
really a shame that so many people's time has been wasted with this matter.  

Please figure out why the program is not showing up on my computer.  Is it 
showing up on Gerald's and Shonnie's?

Hello Felix,

Just following up regarding FASTR ,    I spoke with Kevin Hopper and he said 
that the WINFASTR is the application he is looking for.
it is under Start / Programs / Infobasis.   He is in the group.




Thanks !

RFP,   I had a good time also.  The bands were interesting though.  I bet 
that dude in the helmet sweated his ass off during the performance.  

The date was actually  her call.  We are meeting some of her friends out for 
dinner and drinks and then some sweet sweet love.  Seriously, this girl is 
cool and a lot of fun.  Should be a good time.  Of course I am assuming that 
the date is still on.  In my clear thinking state last night when I left Rudz 
(a la 1 pm) I called her and woke her up.   I really have no idea what I said 
to her.  She may not be speaking to me anymore.

What was with Willis last night?  No show!

Let's circle the wagons this afternoon to discuss Galveston.

Gerry,

Thanks for coming out last night--funny how that sentence could be miss
interpreted.  Seriously though, folks, it was pretty fun even though the
bands were less that par.  We need to do more hanging out, especially now
that Eric won't let us have sex with his wife.  I'm looking forward to some
jams and a trip back down to the Gulf this weekend.  Good luck on the
date--what's the plans?

I'm sorry.  Eric and I aren't speaking at the moment due to creative 
differences.  I want only the orange M&M's removed from our dressing room and 
he wants only the brown ones removed.

Sounds like a good trip if there are spaces available.  I think our dive 
captain is checking availability.  Of course our dive captain is also 
hesitant about being swallowed whole by a Whale Shark.  I told him that with 
a house to remodel that would probably be a blessing.

True.  Especially after I cut E's fat plump rump roast with my dive knife to 
chum the waters a little.  Let's shoot for Friday for lunch.  Maybe I go back 
to work after that or maybe I don't.  No other three Czech brothers can 
cruise so successfully in tight slacks!

talk to.  I am not sure what my intentions are right now but we enjoy each 
others company.

I too, am somewhat hesitant about those large toothed critters, although I'm

carcass.  I figure if everyone else does it why shouldn't we?

As for lunch, I'd like to get together although we break for lunch around 11
over here and that's more like breakfast for you fat-cat lawyer-types.  I'm
down here all week, so let me know if you want to try for something.  Maybe
Friday would be fun?  I'd have a lot more flexibility in my schedule on that
day.

Looks like Saturday is "pay your friend-dues day" at the Gillaspie Ranch.
Seems like all I do is move his ass.  All I know is that he better keep us
well hydrated.

Anywho, what's up with you and the little lady?  She seemed really together.
Hope things are progressing well--if that's your intentions.

Hi Gerald,           How are things going. Fine I hope we are all O.K. I
called the other night and left a message just wanted to talk voice mail for
a  change.!!!!!!!! Have been busy working in the yard. Had to trim all the
shrubs and get rid of all the dead plants.    So what have you been doing.
Anything new going on with you. James started planting this week. He is
trying to get that moisture before it drys out.  We didn't get  any rain
today again.  Starting to look bad.  I'm keeping Jenna and Jake tomorrow.
Janice has a doctors appoitment. Nothing serous just a follow up. Got ashort
email from Paul yesterday he's doing o.k...........Well all for now Dad and
I send our love....Bye for now.

Love...MOM

Attached is a clean and redline version with my changes.  I made a few 
further refinements to the agreement.  I think it would be a good idea to 
walk CDEC through these changes as a lot of these are form not substance.
Jaime,  Attached is a firm sales agreement form which ECT utilizes in  North 
America.  A lot of the form may not be relevant given the fact that (i) Pemex 
is both the seller and transporter and (ii)  unless you are near the border, 
there are no alternative sources to Pemex.  However, it is a good starting 
point.  Let me know if you have any questions.
Mark,  Please disregard the prior versions and review this one.  This 
includes Section 1.4 which requires CDEC to provide us access with the load 
projection systems that are in place.

Hello!  I have been told that you are the interconnect guru.  I think I 
called you a couple of weeks ago with a warning on this one.  What 
information do you need from me to get started on an interconnect agreement 
with Tejas?  The purpose of this interconnect is to deliver 2-3 days of gas 
while we lower the line that feeds the city of Kingsville.  In addition, we 
will keep the interconnect in place as back-up to the city.  Please read the 
attached memo for additional details.  Please note that we would like to have 
this project completed within 3 weeks.

Per Billy Sheilds at Tejas, the cost for a 3" meter and tap is $ 27,000. The 
estimate does not
include separation, regulation or site with fencing which Tejas is expecting 
HPL to provide.
To proceed, the field people need to meet and agree upon the details, and a 
contract needs
to be entered into for all gas delivered from Tejas to HPL at this point. All 
cost incurred for
 the meter installation is reimbursable to Tejas.


Well it looks like Eric is now officially burden with an oppressive 
mortgage.  Won't be long before he is out mowing the lawn in Bermuda short 
and sandals with black socks.  Eventually all the good ones go down.  

What up with you, JT?

G$Jeff,  Attached is the form with some modifications.  Please see that this is 
the form utilized for all releases in the future.  Please call me if you have 
any questions.  (713) 853-3512
Attached is a clean and redlined version the agreement with our revisions.
Ken,  This is the complete document.  The schedule are attached to it.



Stephanie,  I forwarded a hard copy of the operational control letter 
yesterday.  Let me know if you don't have it.  Attached is the price letter.



There is no formal contract in place between TW and EE&CC for the 
construction.  Both TW and ECS as I understand, have signed AFE's with EE&CC 
for the projects.  We will most likely have to address this risk in the 
Contribution Agreement.  I will talk with Mark and Mark about this.

PPA- we are expecting comments back from CDEC late today.  Schedule is now to 
review their comments and meet with them Tuesday (via phone or in person) to 
finalize.  We can likely get Patti a copy after Tuesday.

Contribution Agreement - Pending resolution of the construction risk issues, 
we can have a draft for Patti early next week.
Attached is a draft of the Contractor Protocols which work with the services 
agreements of Hanover Measurement Services Company (Stone Entity) which were 
circulated by Mary Cook last week.  Please review in conjunction with the 
services agreements and provide comments

.TW has the final draft, since they prepared the document.  I have asked for 
it via email.  As soon as I receive I will forward.  Thanks.

GT,   What's up?  Got that house in order yet?  Keeps you busy doesn't it.  
Hope everything is going well.

 I and the redfaced Eric are thinking about a road trip to Austin on the 
weekend of March 18th.  A band we really want to check out (Tenacious D) is 
playing at La Zona Rosa on Sat. the 18th.  Are you going to be around that 
weekend?  We have confirmation via some web site that Tenacious D will be 
there, but have tried calling La Zona Rosa about tix with no success.  Do you 
know anything about this place?  Are the concerts usually walk up tix sales?

Let me know what your schedule looks like.   Oh yeah, Eric's wife Jennifer 
will probably accompany him to Austin.  Eric couldn't get a hall pass for the 
weekend.Attached is a clean and redlined version of the agreement with my changes 
after discussion with Dick Shirley and Fred Lackey this morning.  I will also 
fax a copy to them.
Sure.  Let me know when and where.

Attached is the EnergyShare 2000 Agreement with my revisions included.  
Included is both a clean and redlined version.  I did not review in detail 
the payment calculation methodology.  I will leave this to Mark Courtney and 
John Scarborough for their review.  Please feel free to call me at (713) 
853-3512 if you have any questions or wish to discuss my revisions.


Kay,  Please review the attached.  Thanks for your help.
Attached is the letter agreement which extended the EE&CC confidentiality 
agreement to our deal.  Please review and if it looks OK, print out on ENA 
letterhead two copies for execution.  I will need an original when it is 
executed.
GT,  Sounds like things are going well.  Can't wait to check out the house 
and Heather.  As for myself, I have been hanging out with Cynthia.  Met her 
through a friend.  I guess we are dating.  Not to anxious to stay with one 
girl at this point.  

I'll let you know more early next week about the road trip.  Take care.  

 You wouldn't happen to know someone who could get us cheap South by 
Southwest passes.  We think we will need those passes to see Tenacious D.

Gerald,

How are you buddy? Good to here from you. I will have room for you on the
18th but my nephew will be staying at my house and maybe my mom and neice
too so Eric really needs to get a hotel room. The couch is waiting for you
dude. I only have dinner plans for the 18th. There is a Mardi Gras party to
go to on the 17th thrown by the No Le Hace bunch. Let me know if you are
coming into town.

Are you dating anyone? I am dating a young thing named Heather. She is
really cool.

The house is looking good. They are doing brick work on the front as we
speak.

Hope to here from you.

CDEC and Plains on Tuesday, March 14th, here at Plains.  Please call me at
(505) 889-7318 if you have any problems with this attachment.




 - march 10 2000 version enron cdec.docAttached is the revised scope of work for use with the Mt. West Work Offer.
Hello!   Hope your day is going well.  As for me, it has been pretty busy.  
Dropped my tux off at lunch and it only took about 2 seconds.  I know you 
were looking forward to going with me to drop that off, but you missed out.  

I had a great time this weekend.  Thanks again for accompanying me to the UH 
affair extraordinair.  Nice dress!!  Have a great rest of the day and I will 
talk to you later.

G$Attached is the form of CA.  Set up as a bilateral for asset deals 
primarily.  Easily adjusted to suit your needs though.
If Men TRULY Ran The World...

1.  Breaking up would be a lot easier. A smack to the ass and a
"Nice hustle, you'll get'em next time" would pretty much do it.

2.  Birth control would come in ale or lager.

3.  Valentine's Day would be moved to February 29th so it would
only occur in leap years.

4.  On Groundhog Day, if you saw your shadow, you'd get the day
off to go drinking. Mother's Day too.

5.  St. Patrick's Day, however, would remain exactly the same.
But it would be celebrated every month.

6.  Garbage would take itself out.

7.  Regis and Kathie Lee would be chained to a cement mixer and
pushed off the Golden Gate Bridge for the most lucrative pay-per-view event
in world history.

8.  The only show opposite "Monday Night Football" would be
"Monday Night Football from a Different Camera Angle."

9.  Instead of "beer-belly," you'd get "beer-biceps."

10. Tanks would be far easier to rent.

11. Two words..."Ally McNaked."

12. When a cop gave you a ticket, every smart-aleck answer you
responded with would actually reduce your fine. As in: Cop: "You know how
fast you were going?"   You: "All I know is, I was spilling my beer all
over the place."  Cop: "Nice one, That's $10.00 off".

13. People would never talk about how fresh they felt.

14. Daisy Duke shorts would never go out of style again.

15. Every man would get four, real Get Out of Jail Free cards
per year.

16. Telephones would cut off after 30 seconds of conversation.

17. It would perfectly legal to steal a sports car, as long as
you returned it the following day with a full tank of gas.

18. Instead of a fancy, expensive engagement ring, you could
present your wife-to-be with a giant foam hand that said "You're #1!".

19. When your girlfriend really needed to talk to you during
the game, she'd appear in a little box in the corner of the screen during
a time-out.

20. Nodding and looking at your watch would be deemed as an
acceptable response to "I love you."

21. The funniest guy in the office would get to be CEO.

22. "Sorry I'm late, but I got wasted last night," would be an
acceptable excuse for tardiness.

23. At the end of the workday a whistle would blow and you
would jump out of your window and slide down the tail of a brontosaurus and
right into your car like Fred Flintstone.

24. Lifeguards could remove citizens from beaches for violating
the "public ugliness" ordinance.

25. Hallmark would make "Sorry, what was your name again?"
cards.

Paul,  I am still here.  Where the heck are you?  I guess you are back in the 
States by now.  What are you guy's up to?  How many kids do you have now?

As for Lisa and I, we are still DINKs (Double Income No Kids) in Houston.  I 
am officially an attorney now working in the corporate legal department of 
Enron Capital & Trade Resources.  I had to turn in my pocket protector when I 
left my engineering job.  Lisa actually just joined Enron, so now it is all 
in the family.  We are  doing good.  We bought a 50 yr old house near 
downtown about 1 year ago and have been restoring it ever since.  It really 
is amazing how all that Bob Villa watching is now paying dividends.  I am 
considering getting a tool belt with my name engraved on it.  We are both 
doing good.  Life for me is good, now that I don't have to go to school in 
the evening or study for the bar exam.  I am just enjoying my free time now.

I still keep up with George and Ernie occasionally.  George still lives in 
Austin and is single.  I visit him a couple of times a year.  You wouldn't 
believe it.  He still has the same furniture in his apartment that he had in 
college.  Kind of like stepping into a time warp.  Ernie just finished 
getting his MBA at UT this spring.  He will be working in San Antonio for 
Frito Lay (no doubt designing a chip that won't break when you dip it).  He 
now has a little girl with another kid on the way.  I think due sometime this 
summer.  He has really changed since undergrad.  A responsible young man now.

How are Mom and Pop Bieraugel doing? (Is the Big 10 going to take it in the 
shorts this year?)  Are they still in the Washington area?  Lisa had talked 
to your mom about a year ago when she was trying to track you down for my 
graduation party.  Sounded like all was well in the Bieraugel household.  I 
think she said John was in Alaska?

Anyway, drop me a note when you get a chance.  It is really great to hear 
from you again.  We need to keep in touch.

Gerald, Attached is the final version of the Bammel Compression Turnkey Construction 
Agreement used in Project Looper.  This agreement will require some 
modification for use in Project Coca-Cola, but is a good starting point.  In 
the interest of efficiency I am circulating this for your review and 
comments.  We can then discuss how this needs to be tailored for the CO2 
project.  Please note the following with respect to this agreement:

 1.  A detailed engineering scope of work will be required for the treaters.
 2.  Given the financing objectives for this project, this agreement should 
be as lump sum price as possible with liquidated damages for in-service 
date        risk.
 3.    A performance criteria guarantee section will need to be added which 
references specific plant peformance criteria in the scope of work. 

 FYI, I will be in Albuquerque tommorrow for a Compression Services project.  
After your review let's discuss.
Mark,  The letter with my comments incorporated.
David,  Attached is a short term sheet agreement that I propose we put into 
place for the Gallup electric driver which EECC is installing for Enron 
Compression Services Company.  As I understand it now, we have only an AFE 
with signature for this deal in place.   As I indicated on my voice mail, I 
need something more substantial in place for assignment, since we are selling 
a portion of this project off to investors.  Please review and lets discuss.  
Timing unfortunately is not long as usual.  I would like to meet as soons as 
your schedule allows.  Thanks.

Attached is the assignment and contribution agreement for your review.  I 
would like to get your feedback prior to wide circulation. 

Note:  We are still working with EE&CC to put a basic construction agreement

Subject: LLC Accounting Issue--Consolidation

The Kachina LLC agreement is being amended and restated to accomplish Gallup 
transactions as part of existing Kachina LLC.  The existing Kachina LLC 
agreement currently does not contain a provision giving non-Enron equity 
holders a right to remove the Managing Member with or without cause but does 
give these holders numerous veto rights over actions proposed by the Managing 
Member.  Notwithstanding these veto rights, AA seemed to indicate during our 
meeting earlier this week a desire to include a removal provision.  

Please consider the following:

Given use of existing Kachina structure, do we do need to include removal 
provision as part of amendment and restatement of Kachina LLC or can we table 
this issue for now? 

If we do need to include a removal provision, attached is some proposed 
language which (i) gives non-Enron equity interests right to remove Managing 
Member at any time with or without cause, (ii) requires simultaneous 
appointment of another Member as Managing Member, and (iii) if removal is of 
initial Managing Member (i.e., Enron entity), then initial Managing Member 
has option to cause dissolution of LLC.  

Thanks, NJD


David,  Attached is the agreement with the revisions we discussed.  Please 
review.  I tried to redline againt the previous version, but any section that 
I modified displayed as an entire rewrite of the section.  Maybe you will 
have better luck redlining.  Please call with any questions.  X 33512.
Got the redline to work.  Attached is the redlined version of the 
construction agreement.
I reviewed these changes and they look fine.  Please prepare the 
executables.  Thanks.

Steve,  We are currently negotiating an interconnect agreement for an upgrade 
of an existing interconnect off the Trawick System into TUFCO.  The 
interconnect is solely a delivery to TUFCO.  We are down to one point of 
difference in the agreement.  

Typically HPL disclaims any liability for consequential damages to the other 
party.  TUFCO is asking for an exception for any violation of gas quality 
specifications.  This would mean that if HPL delivered off spec gas to TUFCO 
which required cleanup of their pipeline system or caused damage to a 
customer of TUFCO's HPL would be liable under this Agreement.  

From a legal standpoint, we can make this exception, but I wanted to make 
sure everyone understood and agreed with the acceptance of this potential 
liability.  Assuming we are properly monitoring all our receipts there 
shouldn't be an issue. 

Please let me know what you think about this situation.  I can forward a copy 
of the interconnect agreement if you do not currently have one.   Attached for your review in the Gallup Transaction are the following 
documents:

 1.  Assignment and Contribution Agreement - Assignment operational documents 
and rights in assets from ECS into the LLC 
 
 2.  Engineering, Procurement, and Construction Agreement -  Defines 
relationship between ECS and Enron Engineering and Construction   Company for 
installation of the motor driver at Gallup.  This document will be assigned 
into the LLC except for that portion which relates to the electric power  
transmission line.  The utility will take ownership of the transmission line 
per the power purchase agreement.

Also forwarded via hard copy yesterday, was the executed Power Purchase 
Agreement.  Please let me know if you have not received this yet.  

I will shortly email the form of gas purchase agreement between the LLC and 
ECS.  This will merely be a new Confirm (Transaction Agreement "C") which 
will operate under the existing Enfolio Master Firm Purchase Agreement 
between ECS and the LLC which was created for Kachina.

Hi Katie,   Looks like you got the address right.  I too enjoyed talking with 
you last night.  I know you were disappointed to be distracted from your 
research project for a while.  

Its been a busy week so far.  The end of the yearly quarter always is.  Last 
minute deals have to be closed to book the income.  At this time of year the 
commercial dealmakers get that wild eyed looked which says "I have got to get 
this project done or I am out of here".  March 31 can't arrive soon enough.  

Got any big plans for the weekend?  Hanging out at the Dixie Chicken or is 
that only where rookies hang out?  

Take care and I'll talk to you later.

Gerald

How are things going?  Haven't talked to you in a while.  As for me, I am 
fine.  Work is pretty busy right now.  We are at the end of the quarter and 
have to get certain deals closed before March 31, so it can get hectic.

My roommate will be leaving shortly.  He got a job opportunity with his 
family in North Carolina, so he will be moving.  Didn't last very long, but I 
knew that was a possibility when he moved in.  

Are you guys getting into the wedding planning mode now with Sharon.  It 
should really be a beautiful wedding up in Estes Park.  Very nice mountain 
scenery.  

Take care and I will talk with you later.

Gentlemen, Yes that means you, Eric.  Please review the attached and give me

Amy,  I revised a few things in the agreement.  Should be ready to go.
Susan, Attached is the text I am forwarding to the investors.  Please let me

I talked further with Transwestern Counsel today concerning the issues and 
have the following points;

 1.  FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS (at 
that time via Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) in the filings for the 
certification of the Kachina units.  FERC simply didn't ask any further 
questions in that proceeding.  The Operation & Maintenance Agreements in 
place for the Kachina units essentially accomplishes the same things as the 
Operational Control Agreement in Gallup.  TW feels the O&M agreements would 
be adequate to answer any questions that possibly FERC might ask regarding 
this subject matter.  The Operational Control agreement was put into place in 
Gallup because it was thought to be easier to give FERC exactly what is was 
looking for rather than show them the Gallup O&M Agreement which might slow 
down the process at that time.

 2.  There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of 
penalty or discontinue the Compression Service's due to TW's operation of 
Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement.  No regs or law address 
this situation.  Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware 
of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in 
place to accomplish control for TW.

 3.  I also faxed you a copy of Section 19(c) of the NGA which indicates that 
the petition for rehearing does effect the status of the certificate.  
Construction is moving ahead and the anticipated start date is May 1.  

I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as 
soon as I recieve it.  Let me know if you have any further questions (713) 
853-3512. Heather,

Hi Katie,  I am feeling good about status of the deals!  Looks like we should 
close next Wednesday.  So as it stands now, I don't think I will have to work 
this weekend.  Of course now that I just said that, it almost positive that 
something will come up.

Hmmm,  Actually work might not be such a bad thing as my alternative is 
helping my roommate pack his stuff up for his move to North Carolina.

Have a great weekend! Talk to you soon.

OK.  Thanks for your help, Susan.



John,  Good to hear from you.  Things are going fine.

There aren't really any parking garages close to the ballpark and getting 
near the ballpark on an open lot will be damn near impossible.  I believe 
metro will be running a shuttle from open lots in downtown which are probably 
about 10 blocks away from the park.  There are several of these lots around 
the Enron building and Smith and Lousiana St.  Might be worth checking the 
either the Metro web site or the Enron Field web site to get exact details on 
the Shuttle routes.  I believe the shuttle will drop off directly in front of 
the park.

I received the Nemec Family Reunion flyer recently.  Looks like your whole 
family got drafted into service this year.  I guess thats a danger of showing 
up at those things.  

Take care and we'll talk to you later.

Thanks,  That does the trick.Attached for review is the Confirmation (under existing Enfolio Master Firm 
Purchase Agreement between ECS and ECC) for the gas received by ECC from TW 
pursuant to the Gas Conversion Agreement.
Attached are the following documents with slight changes and all the numbers 
input:
 1.  Amendment to Compressor Services Agreement (Bloomfield)
 2.  Amendment to Compressor Services Agreement (Bisti)
 3.  Amendment to Operation and Maintenance Agreement (Bloomfield)
 4.  Amendment to Operation and Maintenance Agreement (Bisti)

Please disregard the previous versions and focus on these.   Also attached 
are two side letter agreements which specify the net book value for the 
Compressor Motor Buyout provisions (in the event of termination) under the 
Compressor Services Agreements
 5.  Net Book Value Letter for Bloomfield
 6.  Net Book Value Letter for Bisti

Again,  the plan is to have ECT and TW execute these documents and then 
assign all of these along with the agreements they amend and the power 
contracts to the ECS Compression Company, L.L.C.  Your timely review will be 
appreciated.  



Attached is the form of Amendment to the Gas Conversion Agreement that was 
executed by TW on Friday.  The Amendment does the following:

 1.  Shifts gas flow delivery to commence upon the Start Date instead of the 
2 month lag.
 2.  Deems the Start Date for all operational documents with TW to be May 1, 
2000 regardless of when physical start up occurs.

Please contact me at (713) 853-3512 with any questions.  
Attached are Exhibits A to both the Operation and Maintenance Agreement and 
the Contribution and Assignment Agreement - Description of the Assets  



The descriptions of the Assets are duplicate on both Exhibits.     Attached is the Gas Purchase Agreement between Enron Compression Services 
Company and Enron North America Corp.  This backs the gas deal between ECS 
and ECC, LLC.  The pricing and terms are identical.

Note:  In the Kachina deal we used Enron Natural Gas Marketing instead of ENA 
for this gas deal.  After discussions with tax and accounting, there were no 
objections to using ENA in this deal.


Please review.
Ruppert,  Unfortunately it doesn't look like I am going to be able to make it 
due to work.  If things change I will let you know.  

Happy Birthday!!!

Brad,

In follow up to our meetin with Hilcorp yesterday, I am requesting that you 
break out a segment from the original estimate for facilities. 

We have determined that the immediate need will require is a cost estimate 
for the inlet meter at the intersection of the two pipelines.  Hilcorp will 
put in the tap on their line.  I would like to have a notional number of how 
much that saves us also.

Since the estimate is already complete, I am hoping you can just break out 
this information.  Greg Sharp is looking for an answer of go or no go on this 
project as early as this Friday (the 10th).  

Please let me know if this is possible so that I can run some economics....




Steve,  Those were CPS's suggested changes, not mine.  I agree.  I don't know 
what they want for Section 6 and Jim has agreed to get with CPS to get 
further definition.  I also recommend pulling the language inserted in 
Section 3 as Jim indicated we have already submitted all the estimates.  The 
Bexar county venue is unacceptable and will be stricken.  David Marshall is 
reviewing the insurance section and should have an answer today.

I have reviewed the changes which you have made.  Under Section 6, I have no 
idea what we would submit.  Therefore I suggest that the additions under this 
section be removed.  The insurance provision looks fine to me except that I 
would like to see a larger umbrella amount, but you need to get David 
Marshall to bless.  Is there a precedent for having Bexar County the point of 
venue under this contract?  Upon your completion, please send 3 copies to me, 
2 of which I will submit for execution to CPS.

Hi Katie,  So far so good.  Busy but moving forward.  It will be interesting 
to see if I catch my flight or if I have to delay it some.  Denver should be 
nice.  I was watching the weather channel and it appears that it will be 
pretty cold up there.  I saw something about lows in the 10-20s.  Yikes!  
You're right though. I enjoy traveling every once in a while for a change of 
pace.  The guys I work with up there are fun, so that makes the work go alot 
easier.  

Take care and talk to you later.
Gerald

Hey Gerald!
 I'm doing O.K.  How are you?  Mon. and Tues. were busy, but the rest of
the week shouldn't be too bad.  The research project is going well,
except that a lot of the articles we need have to be ordered because our
libraries do not carry the journals.  That's probably typical though.
Tomorrow we have a big meeting with my prof to come up with an outline
for the project, so things should really start falling into place pretty
soon. Starting next Mon. I will be volunteering for the Health-for-all
clinics Health Educator (we have to volunteer for one of my classes).  I
will be helping diabetics and people with high blood pressure plan their
diet and physical activity schedule.  I'm pretty excited, but still need
to read up on nutrition since I am a little rusty.
 Denver, huh?  It will be so beautiful.  I've only been to Colorado once
to ski.  I wasn't too big on the skiing thing, but I did enjoy the
scenery.  You will have a great time.  Do you like that you have to
travel every once in a while for your job?  I would think that it would
be nice to get out of Houston every once in a while.
 Did it rain in Houston last night?  THere was a huge thunderstorm here
around 4:30a.m.  It almost sounded like it was hailing for a minute, but
I don't think it did.  I heard Ft. Worth got it pretty badly.  Three
people were confirmed dead today.  On a lighter note, have fun on your
trip!

 I'm not so sure about the Nobel Prize thing, but hey... it would be
nice.

Take care,
Katie

Hi Katie,  Yes I am back in town.  Sorry I wasn't able to return your email 
yesterday.  It has just been crazy around here and I am leaving for San 
Antonio tommorrow and will be out the rest of the week for the Enron Legal 
Conference.  It is going to be at La Cantera on the northwest side of SA.  
The place sounds pretty relaxing, so it should be fun.  Back in Houston 
Friday late.  

Yea Denver was nice.  Slight delay in the flight, but not due to weather.  
Just the usual airline misadventures.  It was snowing pretty hard when I 
arrived.  Kinda nice to be around some actual cold weather for a change.  
Worked all day Friday and stayed with some friends Sat. night.    Wish I had 
time to go up to the mountains for skiing.  So your not big on skiing huh?  
The first time I went I hated it, but as you get better it really becomes a 
lot of fun.  Last time I went (last March) I tried snowboarding.  It was a 
lot of work to learn a new snow sport.  It was cool after I got the hang of 
it, except for dislocating my shoulder.  Ouch! 

Sounds like ya'll had a good time at Northgate.  I hate it when friends take 
you out and get you drunk.  That seems to happen to me occasionally.  OK more 
than occasionally.  

This time change does make for a rough week.  I didn't wake up until 8:00 am 
for work on Monday.  Just a little later for work than usual. 

Coming into Houston anytime soon?  If you get a chance, I'd really like to 
take you to dinner sometime.  Take care.  Bye!

Gerald  I will revise the documents to reflect Flagstaff and the items we discussed 
at the meeting previously.  

Kevin's email indicates he wants to remove the language concerning a party 
obligations to refund the costs of the interconnect paid for by that party, 
if the other party is unable to maintain their pressure obligations. 

Does this need to stay or be removed?  If this needs to stay, should someone 
tell Kevin that it will remain in the agreement ?

Subject: TUFCO Trawick I/C

Steve,  We are currently negotiating an interconnect agreement for an upgrade 
of an existing interconnect off the Trawick System into TUFCO.  The 
interconnect is solely a delivery to TUFCO.  We are down to one point of 
difference in the agreement.  

Typically HPL disclaims any liability for consequential damages to the other 
party.  TUFCO is asking for an exception for any violation of gas quality 
specifications.  This would mean that if HPL delivered off spec gas to TUFCO 
which required cleanup of their pipeline system or caused damage to a 
customer of TUFCO's HPL would be liable under this Agreement.  

From a legal standpoint, we can make this exception, but I wanted to make 
sure everyone understood and agreed with the acceptance of this potential 
liability.  Assuming we are properly monitoring all our receipts there 
shouldn't be an issue. 

Please let me know what you think about this situation.  I can forward a copy 
of the interconnect agreement if you do not currently have one.   
Attached for review are the clean and redlined versions of the new Field 
Services and Gas Purchase Agreements.  Also attached is a Termination 
agreement which terminates the existing agreements with Kennedy.  Please 
review.  

Dan,  Please make sure the Purchase Agreement pricing is accurate.  
Independant will follow tommorrow.



Attached is the amendment to the field services agreement and a new 
construction agreement for the incremental collection facilities.

Independant needs to prepare Exhibit A to the construction agreement.  This 
is a description of the facilities to be constructed.  The construction 
agreement is the exact form which was executed for the initial Collection 
Facilities.  Please review and if everthing looks acceptable, please forward 
to Independant.
Kay,  Please see attached.
Attached are the draft Confidentiality Agreements for the Colonial Pipeline 
Projects.

Please note the following:

 1.  Need address, contact, full legal name information for Flowserve.
 2.  Please review the scope (1st Paragraph) for both agreements.  Need to 
make sure I not giving the parties to little or too much information 
concerning  each others roles in this project.
 3.  The Flowserve CA is unilateral.  Only binds Flowserve to protect info we 
give them.

Please review and let me know if you have any comments or questions.
Here they are.

Drop me a line and let me know how it is going.  Also do you have Tristan's

beers now and then.Attached are the revised agreements based on our discussion prior.  Please 
review and if everything  looks good, I will prepare executables for MidCon.
Please note the following revisions:

 1.  Midcon installs, owns, and operates the Deer Park Interconnect. 
 2.  HPL installs, owns, and operates the Flagstaff Interconnect.
 3.  If the pressures committments are violated in accordance with the terms, 
the violating party pays the others cost incurred at that interconnect.
 4.  Each Party still entitled to 1/2 capacity at each interconnect.



Please call if you have any questions.  x-33512.


Patti,   Hope everthing finds you well.  Just wanted to check if you had

Followed - means the court followed the holding in the case cited
Dissenting Opinion - means the dissenting justices referenced the case only 
(not really relevant)
Distinguished - court didn't follow the holding of the case or simply found 
that the facts of the two cases were different.

Grenier, Sofregaz's Attorney, and they had no objections to this.  I forgot 
to change this amount on the contract I sent for internal review, but it was 
changed on the contract that I sent to Sofregaz for execution.  Please find

Hi Katie,
 That email was pretty true.  School can be extremely stressful in short

easy lifestyle.  How are thing's going for you with school?  Sounded like

there is a definite ending point with a break between.  
 It has calmed down some around here.  Focusing on things that I had dropped

friend Eric and I had our eye on this black Fernandes model for some time and 
yesterday we decided to go for it.  I am still in the learning stages of

Subject: Another Local Wine Appreciation Group



Since our last email described the closing of La Joie du Vin, we have been
asked a number of times about the existence of any other, similar groups
dedicated to enjoying and learning about wine.  The Wine Society of Texas is
just such a group.  They have extended an invitation to our members and
friends to learn about their organization and participate, either as guests
at events or in an organizational capacity.  We encourage you to take a
moment to read to following introduction and consider supporting and
participating in The Wine Society of Texas.  Their mission and goals are
admirable and we all, as wine lovers, will benefit as those goals are
realized.

Sincerely,

Greg Giordano



From  Dr. R.D. Kane, Co-Chair Houston Chapter & Vice President, Wine Society
of Texas

Greg,

Per our telephone conversation today, I would like to forward this
 message to you and the members in your organization. As we
 discussed, the Wine Society of Texas is a statewide 501(c)3
 educational organization with approximately 350 members in Texas
 and about 120 in Houston. We also have chapters in Austin, San
 Antonio and two in the DFW area. Our mission statement
 (paraphrased and shortened) is to help develop a wine educated
 consummer base in Texas and to support charitable organizations
 and responsible consumption. Unfortunately, some people confuse
 this message with only working with or interest in Texas wines. But,
 this is far from the truth.

 The WST has been working to provide education on wine tasting,
 wine making and grape growing in a pleasant social setting. The link
 to the local wine industry has been a great asset that has helped
 provide first hand experiences in grape growing and wine making.
 Personally, I have picked and crushed and this has given me have a
 much better appreciation for this part of the process everytime I
 down a glass of wine. However, we have also been trying develop an
 awareness in Texas regarding the benchmarks in fine wines, so that
 consummers increase their knowledge of fine wines from around the
 world.

 This latter point is one that is illustrated in our upcoming event,
 Springfest 2000, on March 24-26. The festival event will be held in
 Old Town Spring Texas and the premium events (Vintner Dinner and
 Grand Tasting) will be held at the Hotel Sofitel near Bush IAH.  We
 will have specialists in grape growing and wine making talking about
 new varietals in Texas, some of which have their "roots" in other
 similar regions of the world such as those from Rhone, Spain and
 Italy. We also the Art Institute Culinary School their to give wine and
 food preparation demos. Our Vintner Dinner (Fri. 3/24) will feature a
 special pairing of wines from Texas and France featuring
 Chardonnay and Rhone Blends.  At the Grand Tasting and Media
 Choice Awards Presentations, (Sat. 3/25) the attendees will be
 tasting the best of the wine submitted for judging and vote for their
 favorites. Springfest is a charity event that is raising funds for the
 American Heart Assocition, the Old Town Spring Preservation
 League and the Wine Society of Texas Scholarship Fund. More
 details are available at:

 http://www.winesocietyoftexas.org/houston/

I welcome you and your members to
 check out the WST and Springest 2000. If you have any questions,
or would like more information, please contact me.

Regards,

Dr. R.D. Kane
Co-Chair Houston Chapter & Vice President
Wine Society of Texas

 The Pipeline Joint Defense Group/TECALA, of which HPL is a member, has 
invited Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Tony Garza to come to Houston to 
meet with the group.   I have tentatively offered to include as part of the 
meeting a tour of the Enron Gas Control Room (can you do that, James?) for 
Chairman Garza and a small number of people from the Group (maybe about a 
dozen).  We would like a larger number of representatives from companies 
which are members of the Group to attend the general informal discussion with 
Chairman Garza, probably at either the Enron Building, The Met, or otherwise 
nearby.  Tentative dates are June 23 and June 30, probably in the middle of 
the day with lunch.
 Please let me know whether or not you would like to attend the meeting, and 
if so what date(s) work for you, and I will pass the information on to Roxann 
Neumann, who is coordinating the meeting.  If you think any others would like 
to attend, give me a call (36417) or cc:mail.

The construction agreement with the date information we discussed.  
Sounds like you are running and gunning.  I know how those times feel.  Seems 
like it is never going to end.   You have been through it enough times to 
know that it always does.  I don't think there is any feeling like turning in 
that last paper or walking out of that last final at the end of a semester.  
Feels like a huge weight is lifted off your shoulders.  After that comes 
lifting the huge mug filled with beer.

Hang in there.

I lost the information concerning fly fishing you left on my voice mail.  
Could you be so kind as to resend via email.  I am thinking of just taking a 
poll to see what everyone's interest are.  I personally am thinking Mountain 
Biking sounds like great fun and a super way to endanger my life.  Drop me a 
note when you get a chance.  Also what is the schedule for the get together 
on Sat. Bruce,  Attached is an article I found in the Houston Chronicle business 
section yesterday.  Has a negative outlook, but mostly related to product 
supply B2Bs.    You probably are familiar with most of the B2Bs they 
mention.  Thought might be useful to you.  Good talking to you yesterday.  
The check better arrive this week or I start breaking your stuff one piece at 
a time.
Attached is the master form with the quality language revised.  Please use 
this form from this point forward.
Hi Wayne,  Thanks for the email.  Things are going fine here in Houston.  
Unfortunately this weekend is going to be a bad one for me.  I have to work 
Friday and have plans already for Saturday.  Some other time would probably 
work better.  Let me know what your schedule looks like and we can work 
something out.  Hope things are going well for you in Austin.  Drop me a line

Katie,  Glad I cheered you up.  Believe me, I can relate.  I could tell you 
horror stories about when I was studying for the bar exam.  I'll save those 
for some other time.  

Hope all is going well and moving forward.  What always kept me going was the 
idea that in a few days or a week it would all be over and I wanted to be 
able to look back and feel that I had given the best effort I could.  That's 
all you can do.  It is typically more than enough to do very well in grades.  
I will quit preaching now and let you get back to work.  

No big plans for the Easter Weekend.  Will be here in Houston.  I actually 
have to work on Friday, but am thinking about taking a vacation day.  Sounds 
like you will probably be busy with school and family over your weekend in 
Katy, but give me a call if you feel like it.  Maybe we can do something fun.

Gerald,  good to hear from you and very belated congrats on your law
degree/bar exam/ascent to layerhood deal.  That's way cool.  Sounds like you
are really doing well out there.  Tool belts, house restoration, sounds like
fun.  Too bad the Navy won't allow me the time to do it.   Regardless,
they've been moving me around so much lately that it's all pointless.  I got
back from Italy in Feb.  I started school here in Newport, RI.  Next I'l
spend 3 months in Northern VA going to school.  Then, I'll meet my ship in
the Persian Gulf for a fun filled 4 months in the Desert.  I'm getting
pretty down on the Navy and may be considering a job change in the next two
years.  Well, to answer your question, Michele and I have three kids now.
Kelly is four, Carson is three, and Katherine (Kate) is two months (born
4/15/99).  I figure we're done for now but will have to check back when Kate
is too big to cuddle.  Good to hear George and Ernie are still doing well.
Crazy days we had together.  Funny how we all tend to grow up eventually.
My parents are fine.  They are almost finished with the house on the ranch.
When that is done, they plan to move out there permanently.  John is working
semi-part time as a governemnt employee counting fish on alaskan fishing
boats.  Dangerous job/low pay.  But he likes it and he has his summers for
surfing expeditions (i.e.  he is still bumming around).   Mark is the
biggest suprise, he went back to school and got a Masters degree in library
science and information technology.  He did really well and now has a job
with Microsoft working as an archiver (apparently librarians and computer
geeks too now).  Hey good to hear from you.   don't know when/how we can
work in a visit.  Possibly after March next year unless you're out in San
Diego while Im in the Gulf and you can look Michele up.  Keep in touch and
well work something out.  Take care Gerald.  Paul.

Ron,  Couple of comments.  
 1.  Enitity Name - You noted that Trailblazer is a limited partnership.  The 
name should designate limited partnership in some form (e.g. Trailblazer 
Pipeline  Company, L.P.)  Also for an LP the General Partner will need to 
sign to make it binding.  The signature block should read as follows:

  Trailblazer Pipeline Company, L.P.
   by its General Partner, _________________________

 2.  The limitation on consequential damages limits any remedy under this 
agreement.  The only types of damages in a situation like this is really   
consequential.  I think it would benefit both parties to leave this 
limitation out of the agreement.

If you would like to discuss these issues, please contact me at (713)

I received my copy of ECS's April 13 letter to TW and noticed it was 
addressed to the wrong Susan Scott.  She usually does forward me the mail she 
receives by mistake.  But since the information that we occasionally send 
each other thru interoffice mail for these compressor deals is more important 
than most, I thought I'd let you know my correct room # is 4788.  Also, when 
sending e-mail make sure you address it to Susan Scott at ET&S, not ECT.  
This will ensure I receive everything you send me.  Thanks!

Per your request.  Enjoy.
Sorry,  Sent you the wrong one last time.  I will try it again
Lost my number eh?   A likely story.  Just kidding.  Sounds like you were 
pretty busy with family.  I had a pretty good Easter as well.  Mostly just 
hung out with friends and enjoyed the weather.  Of course I worked in a 
little jam session with my friends.  

The week is going pretty well.  Been in a lot of meetings and those just suck 
up the time.  I am leaving today at lunch to go to Enron Field.  The Cubs are 
in town and it is an afternoon game.  Should be fun.  The Astros really stink 
this year but the field is pretty awesome.  I am not a huge baseball fan and 
but outdoor baseball in Houston is pretty cool.

Good luck on the remainder of your schoolwork.  My numbers are:

 Yes, I survived.  I have a take home final due next Tues. and a 1 page

 I went home this weekend for Easter and was going to call you to see
how you were doing.  I could not find your # though anywhere.  I know
you gave it to me once, but I don't know what I did with it.  What is
your #?  Did you have a good Easter.  It ends up that I wouldn't have
been able to see you.  I came in late Fri. night, spent all day Sat.
doing yard work, went out with my dad and sisters Sat. night, and spent
time with the family on Sun.  Just wanted to let you know that I am not
trying to avoid you.
 How is your week going?  My dad asked about you this weekend.  I told
him we were still e-mailing each other.  He seems to like you.

Have a good day,

Mark,    I received your fax concerning the season tickets.  Thanks for quick 
response.  I thought given the short time frame I would just email with my 
information.

If I could get 2 season tickets in my name on the East Side Lower Deck toward 
the Neuhaus Athletic Center, that would be my preference.  Lisa, indicated 
you wouldn't be able to know what seats might be available until you got all 
the responses back.  If you could email with the seats you have available 
prior to charging my credit card, I would greatly appreciate it.

If the only seats you have would be worse than about the 15 yard line in the 
area I mentioned above, I have a friend who is a Longhorn Foundation member 
with 6 tickets in that area at about the 15 yard line.  His name is Patrick 
McDonald.  If possible that I could attach 2 more season tickets to his 
without affecting the location of his seats, that would be great also.

I don't need OU tix.

My credit card number is 4305 7216 5689 6359  Expires 2/28/02  Visa.  If you 
really need the form filled out, just let me know and I will forward it.

Thanks for your help.Why am I being used as a bargaining piece in this saga?  The thing that 
really scares me, is if I show up I am sure I will be selected to be on next 
years Family Reunion Committee.  Hmmm.

Okay, I guess I can make the sacrifice.  I believe I will have a 3 day 
weekend at that time.  Should work out.  I think the cocktail party on June 
23 will work out.  I have got a lot of things going on right now that would 
make it tough to get away right now for the 13th.

Talked to Mom about the flyfishing.  Sounds like they aren't sure what they 
really want to do.  They are supposed to get back to me.  You know Mom,  
avoid the things that intimidate you.  

Anyway,  hope everything is going well for you and with the wedding plans.

Attached is a draft of the turnkey construction contract for your review.  

Ron,  As we discussed, Exhibit A - Scope of Work will need to be included.  
Please note the following points:

1.  Liquidated Damages - Need to assess a value for these damages.
2.  Force Majeure - This would currently provide EE&CC with relief from the 
In-Service Date requirements and consequently, the LDs.  Is this acceptable?
3.  Permitting - Need to specify in Exhibit F, those permits that ENA would 
secure, and make EE&CC responsible for any others.
4.  Utility Coordination - Currently this is very generally.  Are there 
specific responsibilities that should be stated in this Agreement wrt the 
Utility?

Please review with these in mind.  I will be out tommorrow and Friday.  Let's 
plan on meeting Monday to discuss the draft.  
Are you moving floors or just moving around on 31?  I don't want a lump of 
coal from you at Christmas.

Well, it looks like I'm headed over to the coal group.  They called me up 
after lunch and it's all just a matter of time.  (I actually think the coal 
group cares more about emissions than power, so this might be better after 
all).  Anyway, it appears pretty close to being a done deal.  Barring any 
unforseen glitches, I should be up there in the next week or so.

Brad,

In follow up to our meetin with Hilcorp yesterday, I am requesting that you 
break out a segment from the original estimate for facilities. 

We have determined that the immediate need will require is a cost estimate 
for the inlet meter at the intersection of the two pipelines.  Hilcorp will 
put in the tap on their line.  I would like to have a notional number of how 
much that saves us also.

Since the estimate is already complete, I am hoping you can just break out 
this information.  Greg Sharp is looking for an answer of go or no go on this 
project as early as this Friday (the 10th).  

Please let me know if this is possible so that I can run some economics....

I am doing good.  I was out for 4 days (Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun) of last week.  
Just got back from Mexico.  Playa del Carmen, which is about 45 minutes south 
of Cancun.    Sun, beach, drinks, party and scuba (Not necessarily in that 
order).  It doesn't get any better than that.  Had a great time.

Congrats on 23!  Yes, you are still very young and don't let anybody tell you 
otherwise.  When you join the business world, you will be fighting the image 
that you are too young to be taken seriously.

Dunk the ring tradition?  You have peaked my curiosity!  You will have to 
give me the full rundown on exactly how wild that tradition is.  

Are you moving back to Katy for the summer?  What are your plans?  School, 
work, etc.  

Take care and talk to you later.

Cris,  For the sake of completeness, attached is the form of gas purchase 
agreement and confirm with the $10 million prepayment between ECC and ECS.  
The pricing has not been input yet.  

The gas purchase agreement between ECS and ECT would be a mirror of this one.

Patti,
Attached for your review is a draft supplement to the Gas Price Letter which

very difficult time in my life.  However, I want you to know that you are a 
very special person to me.  The more I get to know you the more I realize 
that we are very similar is so many ways and I think that is why we hit it 
off so well so very quickly.  

I wish I could throw everything I have into a relationship with you, but 
right now there is just too much anger, mistrust, and hurt in my emotions to 
allow that.  All of these feelings result purely from a person I was so close 
with and trusted so dearly and who treated me worse than I could have 
imagined.  These feelings have nothing to do with you and I am sure you 
likely don't understand it all fully.  I am not sure I understand it fully.

I fear I am making a big mistake, because I know you won't be available 
long.  You have so much to offer, beautiful, intelligent, funny, and someone 
who can give as much to a relationship as you need from a relationship.  All 
of these qualities made it so very easy to be taken with you when we 
orginally met.  When I started sensing some of my destructive emotions, I 
freaked out  because I knew we were becoming very close and it pained me to 
realize that I would hurt you.  So I completely pulled back, thinking I 
should cut it now than risk making it harder in the future.  Believe me, it 
is not easy to stay away from you, because even though we have only known 
each other a short time, I miss you and think about you a lot.  It would be 
hard to still see you and know you were dating others because I know I would 
react strongly as you witnessed at Senor Frogs that night.  My kidding you 
about Lee, I will have to admit, also shows my insecurity about that.

Mexico was so wonderful, because (except for that one night) I was able to 
put all of those emotions out of my mind and just focus on you.  I think that 
is why we had such a great time.  Cynthia, when we were together on that 
trip, I felt a lightness that I haven't felt in a long time.  You looked so 
beautiful and sexy in that swimsuit by the bar, and it was all about us and 
nothing else.  I have been through it enough to know that reality of my 
situation creeps back eventually.     

Cynthia you are such a great person and even just typing this note I feel 
like crying.  Sometimes fate is a wonderful thing and sometimes it feels like 
a cruel joke.  I think the timing of our meeting was ill fated.  I know we 
will talk to and see each other again but I know it will be different now.  
As much as I want to hold on to you, I know its stupid to attempt to keep you 
close and yet at some distance.  You have are too smart and have too much to 
offer to put up with that.

Please know that I do have genuine feelings for you and I miss you.

Coens hit most notes in ``Brother''
O Brother, Where Art Thou? (Southern comedy-drama, color, PG-13, 1:46) 
By Todd McCarthy, Daily Variety Chief Film Critic 
CANNES (Variety) - A musically tinged riff on ``The Odyssey'' set in the 
Depression-era Deep South, ``O Brother, Where Art Thou?'' is a charming, if 
lightweight, Coen brothers escapade flecked by plenty of visual and 
performance grace notes. 
Picaresque tale of three cons in flight from life on a chain gang is more 
memorable for its fantastic moments than for its somewhat insubstantial 
cumulative impact, which will likely translate into just OK box office 
results come domestic release in the fall. 


While the film's epigraph and inspiration come from Homer, its title derives 
from Preston Sturges' film-biz classic ``Sullivan's Travels,'' in which the 
successful director played by Joel McCrea wants to abandon comedy to make a 
socially conscious drama about the Human Condition called ``O Brother, Where 
Art Thou?'' Despite appropriating the handle, the Coens aren't about to fall 
into the trap of pretentiousness themselves, crafting instead a seriocomedy 
that makes a fanciful tour of an Old Mississippi in which kismet and good 
bluegrass music prevail over racism and criminality. 
Working with their customary tonal precision and immaculate craftsmanship, 
the Coens release into the wilds three escaped criminals, with the leader, 
Everett Ulysses McGill (George Clooney), telling his cronies Pete (John 
Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson) that he knows where $1.2 million is 
buried. The first person they encounter, however, a blind black man driving a 
railway handcar, warns them that they will find treasure out there, but not 
the treasure they're seeking. 
A preening fancy man obsessively concerned with securing the right pomade for 
his coiffure and given to highfalutin phraseology (''It's a fool who looks 
for logic in the chambers of the human heart,'' he advises), Everett stands 
by as his buddies are cleansed of their sins in a mass river baptism. Picking 
up a young black musician, Tommy Johnson (Chris Thomas King), on the road, 
the fellows wander into an isolated radio station/recording studio and, 
posing as a group called the Soggy Bottom Boys, cut a lively tune and are 
paid a few bills for their efforts. They then take off again and remain 
oblivious to the fact that the record becomes a huge hit. 
One eventful encounter follows another as the boys make their way across the 
lushly verdant landscapes, which have been photographed by Roger Deakins in 
slightly washed-out and burnished hues that are a constant delight. They hook 
up for a bank robbery with gleeful adrenaline freak George Nelson (a 
wonderfully live-wired Michael Badalucco), who hates his nickname, Babyface, 
and goes into a huge post-crime funk. 
In a humorously lyrical sequence that represents a magical synthesis of 
visuals, performance and music, the boys come upon three ``sirens'' who 
seduce them in a watery glade; when Pete disappears thereafter, the dense 
Delmar presumes that his friend has been turned into a toad, which he 
proceeds to carry around in a shoebox until a predatory one-eyed salesman for 
the word of God (a Cyclops-like John Goodman) squeezes the critter to death 
while beating the other two silly. 
Pete eventually turns up again, only to become perturbed when Everett reveals 
that his real goal, rather than the nonexistent treasure, is to reunite with 
the mother of his seven daughters, Penny (Holly Hunter), who is about to 
marry another fellow. In the course of things, the errant adventurers brush 
up against local politics, a governor's race that pits old incumbent Pappy 
O'Daniel (Charles Durning) against a reform candidate whose motto, ``Friend 
of the Little Man,'' is literally represented by a broom-toting dwarf who 
accompanies him at every campaign stop. 
After slipping in a quiet homage to ``Sullivan's Travels'' in which members 
of a chain gang are given a little recreation at a ``picture show,'' the 
Coens deliver one of their major set pieces, a stupendously choreographed Ku 
Klux Klan rally that is disrupted by the boys in a fashion that slyly evokes 
the invasion of the Wicked Witch's castle by Dorothy's friends in ``The 
Wizard of Oz'' Raucous, the-devil-gets-his-due musical climax is fun (and 
given a big charge by Durning in a splendid, performance-capping turn), but 
is also rather too fairy-tale-ish and too-good-to-be-true to truly satisfy, 
leaving this an ``Odyssey'' without full closure. 
Lack of irony and complexity in the wrap-up may be a shortcoming, but it also 
points up the welcome absence of condescension and ridicule in the film's 
portrait of dimwits, con men, rednecks and country folk. Most of the 
characters, including the three leads, may be dumb, misguided and delusional, 
but they are also engaging and straightforward, to be enjoyed for the 
colorful oddballs that they are. 
Not for the first time recalling Clark Gable in his looks and line delivery, 
Clooney clearly delights in embellishing Everett's vanity and in delivering 
the Coens' carefully calibrated, high-toned dialogue. Turturro and Nelson (a 
character actor who directed the 1997 indie ``Eye of God'' and the upcoming 
``Othello'' update ``O'') are a real dumb-and-dumber combo without veering 
into slapstick, while supporting cast reflects the typical Coen richness, 
from Durning and well-known regulars Goodman and Hunter through Stephen Root 
as the blind recording entrepreneur, musician King as the boys' sometime 
collaborator and Daniel Von Bargen as a relentless sheriff who pursues the 
escapees to the bitter end. 
Not as elaborate as ``The Hudsucker Proxy'' or ``The Big Lebowski'' pic is 
nonetheless a modest technical marvel in which Deakins' splendid camerawork 
blends seamlessly with Dennis Gassner's evocative production design, Mary 
Zophres' imaginative costumes and some special and digital effects that are 
all but imperceptible as such (watch for that cow). Delta blues music, a 
combo of T Bone Burnett and pre-existing tunes, is another major plus.

Gerald:

All the following are working documents since we have no executed agreement 
with LIPA or any other entity at this stage.

Here is the LD information from the PPA: 



Here's the force majeure section:



Here's our initial permit working document parts of which may be directed to 
EE&CC. For now assume the entire list is our responsibility.



Here's an initial cut at scope and a draft materials list:

  

Utility coordination is a bit of a mixed bag because we have to work with 
LIPA on transmission issues and KeySpan on site access and demineralized 
water supply issues. KeySpan is also LIPA's contractor for transmission 
operations. We are hoping to structure a management services agreement with 
KeySpan where they would provide mooring space, interconnections for water 
and power as well as operation and maintenance services.

Let me know what else you need. I'll keep you updated as we move closer to 
agreement with LIPA/KeySpan.

Subject: Mooring Facility Construction

Attached is a draft of the turnkey construction contract for your review.  

Ron,  As we discussed, Exhibit A - Scope of Work will need to be included.  
Please note the following points:

1.  Liquidated Damages - Need to assess a value for these damages.
2.  Force Majeure - This would currently provide EE&CC with relief from the 
In-Service Date requirements and consequently, the LDs.  Is this acceptable?
3.  Permitting - Need to specify in Exhibit F, those permits that ENA would 
secure, and make EE&CC responsible for any others.
4.  Utility Coordination - Currently this is very generally.  Are there 
specific responsibilities that should be stated in this Agreement wrt the 
Utility?

Please review with these in mind.  I will be out tommorrow and Friday.  Let's 
plan on meeting Monday to discuss the draft.  




I will get something to you within the next couple of days.  Should be a 
straightforward letter agreement.

meter for Southern Union.  We are currently awaiting the final word from El

		Big 12 leads recruiting charge	
?			
			
			
			
			
			
?	By Bill Hodge
FANSonly.com

Dominating the 1999-2000 college basketball recruiting season, the Big 12 has 
five teams in the top 15 men's classes following the late signing period. 
	
	

	
	
	Search for signings 
	
	The spring signing period ran from April 12 to May 15. Use FANSonly.com's 
databases to find all the signings for your favorite school. 
	Men's database search 
	Women's database search. 
	
	Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, Texas, Missouri and Iowa State all had outstanding 
recruiting campaigns. 
	Overall results are pending as signed scholarships continue to arrive 
following the final signing day on May 15. Financial aid agreements (binding 
schools, but not athletes) may still be signed. Eligibility problems are 
common and will affect final rankings as well. 
	Iowa, Indiana and Michigan State head up the top of the Big Ten, while 
Connecticut, Seton Hall and St. John's collected impressive classes in the 
Big East. North Carolina headed the ACC and Cincinnati topped Conference-USA, 
while Memphis, under new head coach John Calipari, finished strong. Alabama 
leads the SEC. 
	If you're looking for pure size, 7-foot-6 center Neil Fingleton, a native of 
England who attended Worchester-Holy Name Central Catholic, Mass., signed 
with North Carolina. Curtis Johnson, a 7-4 center from Norfolk-Ryan Academy, 
Va., is set for St. John's. However, neither will play early roles. 
	1. Connecticut
F Caron Butler,6-7, Pittsfield-Maine Central Institute, Maine
G Taliek Brown, 6-1, Astoria-St. John's Prep, N.Y.
F Scott Hazelton, 6-8, Lawrence-Central Catholic, Mass.
F Johnnie Selvie, 6-7, Flint, Mich/Southeastern CC, Iowa
G Robert Swain, 6-4, College Park-Tri-Cities, Ga. 
	The Huskies have an outstanding class, adding a top junior college player in 
Selvie, plus Swain during the spring. Coach Jim Calhoun had to worry about 
signing Butler, the top prep school prospect in the nation, at the last 
minute over UNLV. Brown and Hazelton are both McDonald's All-Americans and 
potential stars, but all attempts by the UConn staff of signing a big man 
failed. Brown is physical and a scorer. Hazleton is a smooth wing player. 
	2. Seton Hall
F Eddie Griffin, 6-8, Philadelphia-Roman Catholic, Pa.
G Andre Barrett, 5-8, Manhattan-Rice, N.Y.
G Marcus Toney-El, 6-6, West Orange-Seton Hall Prep, N.J.
F Damion Fray, 6-8, Huntington Station-Whitman, N.Y. 
	Coach Tommy Amaker has this program on the way up and added three Top 50 
players in Griffin (considered by many as the top prospect in nation), 
Barrett and Toney-El. All three should step into the starting lineup or find 
extensive playing time off the bench. 
	3. Oklahoma
F James Wright, 6-6, Winchendon School, Mass.
F Johnnie Gilbert, 6-7, Minneapolis-Patrick Henry, Minn.
F Aaron McGhee, 6-8, Vincenness JC, Ind.
F Daryan Selvy, 6-6, Carl Albert JC, Okla.
C Ronnie Griffin, 6-9, Tallahassee CC, Fla.
G Blake Johnston, 6-1, Midland, Texas
F Joszef Szendrei, 6-9, Northeastern JC, Colo. 
	Coach Kelvin Sampson landed athletes who can run and rebound with power. 
McGhee and Selvy are first-team junior college All-American forwards and both 
Griffin and Szendrei are very strong inside. Wright and Gilbert were highly 
rated preps. 
	4. Oklahoma State
F David Anderson, 6-8, Hargrave Military Academy, Va.
G/F Terrence Crawford, 6-6, Oklahoma City-Bishop McGuinness, Okla.
G Ellis Kidd, 6-5, Dallas-Madison, Texas
C Jack Marlow, 6-11, Tulsa-Union, Okla.
F Ivan McFarlin, 6-7, Sugar Land-Willowridge, Texas
G Maurice Baker, 6-1, Dixie JC, Utah
G Melvin Sanders, 6-5, Seward CC, Kan. 
	Coach Eddie Sutton is very high on Sanders, McFarlin and Crawford. Marlow 
weighs 285 pounds. Kidd can light it up and Anderson is very quick for 6-8. 
Baker and Sanders were Spring additions and can score. 
	5. Iowa
C Jared Reiner, 6-11, Tripp-Delmont, S.D.
F Glen Worley, 6-8, Iowa City-West, Iowa
G Brody Boyd, 5-10, Dugger-Union, Ind.
F Courtney Scott, 6-6, Lansing-Waverly, Mich.
F Sean Sonderleiter, 6-9, Des Moines-Christian, Iowa
F Reggie Evans, 6-8, Pensacola-Woodham, Fla/Coffeyville CC, Kan. 
	Guard Luke Recker and guard Ryan Hogan, both redshirt transfers, also join 
the Hawkeyes. This is one of the top Hawkeye classes ever, as coach Steve 
Alford signed a highly rated center in Reiner (who passed on UConn and 
Kansas), a top forward in Worley and an unbelievable shooter in Boyd. Evans 
is considered a top junior college prospect at power forward and Hogan played 
at Kentucky before transferring. The huge prize is Recker, who transferred to 
Arizona from Indiana and then moved to Iowa in order to be nearer his family 
and girlfriend, who was seriously injured in a car accident. After an appeal, 
the NCAA allowed eligibility this fall. Recker averaged 16 points as a 
sophomore for the Hoosiers and was third-team all-Big Ten. The Hawkeyes 
already have a junior committment from one of the top guards in the nation, 
Pierre Pierce of Westmont, Ill. 
	6. St. John's
G Omar Cook, 6-1, Middle Village-Christ the King, N.Y.
F Kyle Cuffe, 6-8, Manhattan-Rice, N.Y.
C Mohammed Diakite, 6-11, Rockville-Montrose Christian Academy, Md.
G Willie Shaw, 6-6, Bronx-Stevenson, N.Y.
C Curtis Johnson, 7-4, Norfolk-Ryan Academy, Va. 
	Forward Alpha Bangura and center Abe Keita are coming off redshirt years, 
which makes coach Mike Jarvis' list of fresh faces even bigger. Jarvis had 
corralled a super class, perhaps best in the nation, but the key was F Darius 
Miles, 6-9, East St. Louis, Ill. A do-everything player generally rated among 
the top three prospects in the country, Miles turned to the NBA rather than 
attend St. John's. Without him, this group tumbles a few notches from their 
No. 1 ranking after the early signing period. Cook is dynamic and Diakite 
could the Red Storm's best center in years. Both have great basketball bodies 
and athleticism. Johnson was a late addition and is considered a project. F 
Eric King, 6-7, Brooklyn-Lincoln, NY., had entrance problems. 
	7. Cincinnati
F Jamaal Davis, 6-8, Purdue/Barton County CC, Kan.
F Rod Flowers, 6-8, Huntsville, Ala.
G Field Williams, 6-3, Houston-Waltrip, Texas
F Antwan Jones, 6-8, Tallahassee CC, Fla.
G Immanuel McElroy, 6-4, Tyler JC, Tex. 
	Reloading, the Bearcats have a great class with junior college standouts 
Jones, McElroy and Davis. Davis played at Purdue before transferring. Flowers 
and Williams are promising. National-quality guard/forward Jerome Harper of 
Columbia, S.C., had his letter withdrawn due to off-court/entrance problems 
and will attend junior college. 
	8. Texas
G/F Brandon Mouton, 6-5, Lafayette-St. Thomas More, La.
C/F Brian Boddicker, 6-9, Duncanville, Texas
C Jason Klotz, 6-11, Houston-Klein Forest, Texas
F James Thomas, 6-8, Hargrave Military Academy, Va.
G Fredie Williams, 6-2, Mississippi Delta CC, Miss.
G Royal Ivey, 6-3, Blairstown, N.J. 
	This group, powered by big men wanting to play for coach Rick Barnes, is one 
of the nation's best. Thomas is tough and Boddicker was rated the best 
propect in the state. Both should get playing time with the departure of 
center Chris Mihm to the NBA. Purdue wanted Mouton badly, as he is a major 
offensive threat. Other keys are Ivey, Williams and Klotz. 
	9. Indiana
F Jared Jeffries, 6-10, Bloomington-North, Ind.
F/G A.J. Moye, 6-5, Atlanta-Westlake, Ga.
G Andre Owens, 6-3, Indianapolis-Meridian, Ind.
F Mike Roberts, 6-8, New Hampton-Prep, N.H. 
	Coach Bob Knight and the Hoosiers shocked Duke by signing Jeffries, one of 
the best forwards in the nation, and all four prospects are top quality. Moye 
is a physical player and suited for the Big Ten wars, and Owens and Roberts 
are very tough. Jeffries, a huge believer in Knight, threatened to transfer 
if the veteran coach had been fired. 
	10. Michigan State
G Marcus Taylor, 6-3, Lansing-Waverly, Mich.
F Zach Randolph, 6-8, Marion, Ind. 
	Spartan followers can't complain about a class with the top guard and 
center/forward in the nation. Higher-rated schools just had more prospects. 
Taylor is outstanding and should see time early. Randolph, still not 
qualified, is a widebody who dominated prep all-star play and could be the 
Spartans' best post player in recent years.		Please see the attached.  I am still trying to obtain the DOE reports for 
Canada from Juanita Marchand for Question #19 of the Pan Alberta.  Any help 
you could give me there would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks for the quick turnaround!Couple of Coca-colas?

Let me know if you need anything else.  I think we are ready to review the 
doc as soons as you get done.  Thanks.

Chris,  My comments are as follows:

 1.    The term (Article 4) was revised from the previous draft (month to 
month) to now being a definitive term with no evergreen provision.  Is this   
acceptable commerically?  Should we add an evergreen provision on to the end 
of the current definitive term?

 2.  Section  9.9 - Doesn't give a time frame for this approval process.  
Hattiesburg has no obligations under this agreement until this approval 
occurs.   What if it doesn't occur for 3 years?  Need either (i) ability to 
walk away from this agreement if not done by date certain, or (ii) assurances 
from   Hattiesburg that this is a short process or has already been 
accomplished.

 3.  Definition 1.2 in the GTC of "day".  Does this day match the gas day for 
the interstate pipelines?  If not will this cause problems in scheduling. 

 4.  General Comment:  Does this interruptible agreement provide the level of 
service that this power plant will commercially   require?  Hattiesburg can 
interrupt service at any time at  its discretion and furthermore, never 
provide service under this   agreement by indicating to Caledonia that its 
storage capacity is full with other storage committments.  Does this work?

I would structure the agreement as an absolute obligation by ENA to pay the

is outside this agreement and should be handled separately.  Make that change 
and let's execute.  Call Janet Wallis to determine the ENA person to execute.

since we're still awaiting word from Tejas as to whether or not they will

Please advise as to the status of the agreement I requested you draft for

as payor whereby HPL will be kept whole on its costs to install the Lockhart 
meter for Southern Union.  We are currently awaiting the final word from El

them under the JV Agreement., so the reimbursement amount will either be 
HPL's full share of $44,000 or half of that amount, as you know from the 
Lockhart Agreement in which you participated.

Please let me know where you are on this.

Thanks, Gerald!

With respect to the weekend; change of plans.  I will be staying in Houston

Also, I am now an engaged man. Heather and I are super happy but don't

Attached is a revised construction agreement (redlined version) incorporating 
the changes we discussed.  I have not changed either the liquidated damages 
or force majeure provisions at this point.  Ron, you indicated in your voice 
mail that you wanted to wait until things firmed up a bit more with respect 
to those provisions.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Not sure if we should forward to EE&CC at this point yet, given the

Heidi,  I have reviewed the contracts and the amendments and the following is 
their status:

 1.  Contract Number 96006959 (012-41991-02-004)  Amended April 1, 1999

  Term:  Month to Month and may be terminated by either party with 10 days 
written notice prior to end of the month (But see rate section below)

  Rate:  Agreement was amended on April 1, 1999 to put a flat rate of $0.085 
for all receipts at Thompsonville (Meter #6351) through March 31,   2006 
(This language would override the month to month term)  No other Points of 
Receipt are allowed under this contract.

  Note:  Prior to the Amendment on April 1, 1999, the $0.01 fee escalator was 
still in effect for any volumes moved under this contract prior to the   
Amendment.  If the escalator wasn't assessed during that time, it should have 
been.  This escalator would have applied to all receipts and    fees on the 
original Exhibit A to the contract. 

 2.  Contract Number 96006966 (012-41991-02-003)  Amended April 1, 1999

  Term:  In effect through March 31, 2006

  Rate:  Those set forth on Exhibit A as amended on April1, 1999 for the 
terms set forth on Exhibit A.

Let me know if you have any questions concerning the above summary.  Brad,  Can you give me a status on where you are at with the review of the 
Lease Docs for the MEGS Facilities? I forward those documents about a month 
back.

they were sordid and made me somewhat uncomfortable.  Well sort of. Your

the better my chances of picking up some furniture real cheap.  Haven't seen

I have reviewed your response and disagree with the characterization of our 
modification the documents. I would like to clarify our reasons for the 
modifications to avoid any further miscommunications.

MEGS' alteration of the documents do not impair the protections afforded to 
Marathon under the Production Handling Agreement.  Our modifications were 
simply intended to allocate certain risks between MEGS and Mariner with 
respect to Marathon (as operator of the South Pass 89 B Platform) as such 
risks were intended to be allocated by MEGS and Mariner.  Mariner's transfer 
of interest in the flowline to MEGS introduces a new party which Marathon can 
look to for certain obligations with respect to the platform.  The 
alterations do not remove Mariner from its current role as operator and 
maintainer of the flowline and owner of the hydrocarbons.  For these reasons, 
I would disagree with your response that the draft alterations do not provide 
the intended protections that Marathon would expect absent such a transfer to 
MEGS.  Mariner still shoulders these risks and expenses under the Production 
Handling Agreement.

Having MEGS fully ratify the Production Handling Agreement  and becoming 
jointly and severally liable to Marathon is not appropriate.   MEGS does not 
hold title to any hydrocarbon production or operate the facilities and should 
not be liable for all risks and expenses associated therewith.  Mariner 
should continue to shoulder those risks and as before.

I would be happy to discuss your issues with our Platform Lease revisions at 
your convenience or to discuss the above further.

I have forwarded to you via one of our assistants a copy of the standard 
Timber Harvesting Agreement that has been offered to me by Southern 
Timbergrowers, our chosen contractor, for work that we desire to begin 
immediately.

Assuming that HPL has some type of pro forma agreement that would better fit 
this situation, I tried to mark-up their agreement indicating some of the 
features at a minimum that we would desire from this business arrangement.

Please could one of you (Gerald is receiving the walk-up copy) get back with 
me with some type of draft agreement within the next few days that I can take 
to ST in order that we may begin the evaluations that we have before us?  I 
would very much appreciate your attention to this.

Thanks!

CandyAttached is Marathon's response to our email.  I will call Brad to set up a 
telephone conference.  

Ted,  Steve asked that I forward this information to a lawyer at Burlington, 
but couldn't recall the name.  Do you have any contact information for 
Burlington.  Thanks.

Gerald, It seems that the drafts that have been sent back to Marathon have 
confused the relationships of Marathon, Mariner and MEGS. As an example you 
have requested that the LOPSA rely on the O&M Agreement between Mariner and 
MEGS, which Marathon is not a party.  We would rather that agreement remain 
between MEGS and Mariner and be the basis for your resolution of disputes. 
The legal capacities presented in your response to the LOPSA draft are 
confusing. All rights seem to flow to MEGS, yet the obligations seem to be on 
Mariner, we do not believe the division of rights and obligations in this 
manner are a good situation. By example the Indemnity provisions have been 
altered to have Mariner indemnify the Owners and Operator (no mention of 
MEGS)and then further change the indemnity to a negligence based indemnity 
(of Platform Operator). The PHA is a unilateral indemnity to Platform 
Operator and Platform Owners and we must insist on this same level of 
protection with MEGS.
If you would like to make another attempt at either a ratification or LOPSA 
that addresses MEGS as Lessee and Mariner as its operator and provide for any 
resolution between those two in the O&M Agreement we would be happy to 
discuss this further. If you would like to go through the LOPSA line by line 
please call and we can set up a teleconference with our legal department to 
do so.

I have reviewed your response and disagree with the characterization of our
modification the documents. I would like to clarify our reasons for the
modifications to avoid any further miscommunications.

MEGS' alteration of the documents do not impair the protections afforded to
Marathon under the Production Handling Agreement.  Our modifications were
simply intended to allocate certain risks between MEGS and Mariner with
respect to Marathon (as operator of the South Pass 89 B Platform) as such
risks were intended to be allocated by MEGS and Mariner.  Mariner's
transfer of interest in the flowline to MEGS introduces a new party which
Marathon can look to for certain obligations with respect to the platform.
The alterations do not remove Mariner from its current role as operator and
maintainer of the flowline and owner of the hydrocarbons.  For these
reasons, I would disagree with your response that the draft alterations do
not provide the intended protections that Marathon would expect absent such
a transfer to MEGS.  Mariner still shoulders these risks and expenses under
the Production Handling Agreement.

Having MEGS fully ratify the Production Handling Agreement  and becoming
jointly and severally liable to Marathon is not appropriate.   MEGS does
not hold title to any hydrocarbon production or operate the facilities and
should not be liable for all risks and expenses associated therewith.
Mariner should continue to shoulder those risks and as before.

I would be happy to discuss your issues with our Platform Lease revisions
at your convenience or to discuss the above further.

Please see attached.  Thanks.
Attached is the draft CA for Intergen.  Note that there are still several 
blanks in the Agreement that I need information to complete.  Please review 
and let me know if you have any questions.
Greg,  

Attached is correspondence between Marathon and Enron (MEGS) concerning the 
revised draft of the lease that I had forwarded for Marathon's review and 
also to you for Mariner's review.  I wanted to give you the benefit of these 
discussion we have had with Marathon concerning how the MEGS and Mariner's 
responsibilities should be split.  Our intent with these revisions, and the 
our goals as we continue to work with Marathon on these issues is to simply 
allocate the risks between Mariner and MEGS with respect to Marathon, as 
Mariner and MEGS intended them to be allocated under the O&M Agreement 
between the two.  We are not asking Marathon to rely on the O&M Agreement to 
which they are not a party.  Risk associated with ownership of the flowline 
should run to MEGS and risk associated with the operation and maintenance of 
the flowline and ownership of the hydrocarbons should run to Mariner as they 
currently do under the Production Handling Agreement.  We intend to work with 
Marathon toward this end.  If you have any comments concerning these 
discussions or would like to discuss this further with me, please contact me 
at (713) 853-3512.  I would also be interested in any comments you may have 
with respect to the draft lease agreement I forwarded to you earlier.  Thanks.

Thanks for taking care of the ring and thanks again for the hosptality.  I 
will be back in not too long.  See Ya

G$How is it going?  Did you have a fun weekend?  My weekend was, although 
enjoyable,  challenging.  First Eric's wife got sick Friday night and wasn't 
able to go out the whole weekend.  Next, my car battery completely died when 
I arrived at my friends house in Austin.  I replaced the battery and 
everything was fine.  Eric, I,  and my friend proceeded to Maggie Maes to see

Staci,  Attached is the amendment.  Please forward your revisions for my 
review.  Thanks.
Got my car back.  $700 to fix.  Ouch!  I am really just glad it wasn't 
worse.  When I stopped my car it was really smoking and I was afraid I had 
burned my moter up.  Eric was providing my transportation during the absence 
of the car.  What a great guy.  Yes, we should try to hook up this weekend.  
The only thing I have going right now is a party that one of the attorneys in 
my group is throwing Saturday night.  Hopefully I will be able to get out of 
there fairly early.  Let's talk before the weekend to try and work something 
out.   I am interested in discussing the Anne situation with you also.  Talk 
to you later.

Your weekend sounds like a nightmare.  I guess now you have a great excuse to 
buy a new car.  What did the garage say about the problem(s)?  

My weekend was pretty fun.  I went to a happy hour Friday night with the 
power trading folks -- now that I'm gone, they're all friendly and talk to 
me.  My cleaning lady came on Saturday so I met two friends for brunch at 
Guggenheim's and we were their from 11:00 to 3:30!  Totally killed the day, 
but it was nice and relaxing.  I did manage to run some errands (something 
productive).  Anne (tall blonde that was at the happy hour) and I went to 
Liberty Noodles for dinner and then hit the downtown bar scene -- totally 
boring.  (Anne is single these days if you want me to hook you up).  Sunday, 
more brunching and then Anne and I went to see Mission Impossible 2...Tom 
Cruise is still totally hot and i didn't mind watching him for two hours.  
That was it.  Not very exciting.  

We should try and do something this weekend.  I have another happy hour 
Friday night but other than that no plans.  This week is pretty busy.  I'm 
starting to panic.  Gotta run.

By the way....how are you getting around these days?

How is it going?  Did you have a fun weekend?  My weekend was, although 
enjoyable,  challenging.  First Eric's wife got sick Friday night and wasn't 
able to go out the whole weekend.  Next, my car battery completely died when 
I arrived at my friends house in Austin.  I replaced the battery and 
everything was fine.  Eric, I,  and my friend proceeded to Maggie Maes to see 
the band Pale (the whole point of our trip, right!).  We arrived at Maggie 
Maes and asked which level Pale was playing on and were informed they had

Here it is guys.  Still checking for any cleanups, but in interest of time I 
am forward for your review.  It is redlined against the previous revised 
version.
Attached is a redlined version of the agreement with the revisions.  Some 
revisions beyond  those we discussed with BR were made strictly to clear up 
inconsistencies in the original document.  Please review and let me know if 
you have any questions.  I plan on being at the Member Meeting in Denver next 
week, but please call any time prior if you wish to discuss.  (713) 853-3512.
I will be forwarding the LLC and Administrative Agreement with revisions 
tomorrow.  The revisions to these docs are slight and only made to reflect 
the be consistent with the substantive changes in the Capacity Allocation and 
Expansion Determination Agreement.

I should have a draft for you by Friday.

I have forwarded to you via one of our assistants a copy of the standard 
Timber Harvesting Agreement that has been offered to me by Southern 
Timbergrowers, our chosen contractor, for work that we desire to begin 
immediately.

Assuming that HPL has some type of pro forma agreement that would better fit 
this situation, I tried to mark-up their agreement indicating some of the 
features at a minimum that we would desire from this business arrangement.

Please could one of you (Gerald is receiving the walk-up copy) get back with 
me with some type of draft agreement within the next few days that I can take 
to ST in order that we may begin the evaluations that we have before us?  I 
would very much appreciate your attention to this.

Thanks!

Here are two FERC cases for your ECS files.  The certificates for Cotton 
Valley Compression are on tomorrow's FERC agenda.  The forthcoming orders may 
be relevant to future ECS projects.  With respect to Transwestern, the 
attached orders make it clear that the FERC knows how to order what it views 
as a jurisdictional entity to show cause regarding its status and, ultimately 
to file for a certificate.  This is consistent with our view  of the 
Transwestern order. - Randy

Subject: Re: thank you


Jamie,
Thank you for coming by.  I actually had a conversation with JC this morning 
regarding electrical compression.  I have an idea I am working on and I was 
wondering if I gave you horsepower requirements and assumed  distances from 
high voltage power lines for 4 compression stations along a pipeline.  Would 
it be a big deal for you to get me some estimated rates?
Again,  this is only an idea right now so I don't want you spinning your 
wheels if it takes a lot of work.  But, I thought if you just had a couple of 
spreadsheets that you needed to fill in some blanks on, maybe you could do it?
Also, the total horsepower requirements are on the order of 13,755 hp in 4 
stations.  So if your minimum is 9,000 hp per station we can't hit that, but 
if it is a 9,000 hp min. on a project as a whole then it might amount to 
something.
Thanks,
Gaylen

Shelley,

Thank you for your time last week.  I enjoyed meeting with you and your
colleagues to discuss electric motor compression and its applications for
the Questar system.  As I was walking out of the building, JC and I had a
couple of minutes to chat and he told me that he would give me a call
sometime in the next couple of weeks to discuss some projects that Questar
may be considering in the near future.

I am looking forward to exploring opportunities with you.

If you have any questions, or need any further information from me, please
do not hesitate to call.

1.  The changes include those that Chris and I discussed in Denver.  The 
Capacity Allocation Agreement is redlined against the version BR had reviewed 
earlier.  All other docs. are redlined against the originals.

2.  Due to the Credit Agreement structure, portions of the Natural Gas Fuel 
Liquidation concept were placed into the Administrative Services Agreement.  
This was done in order to allow that portion of the Natural Gas Fuel value 
which covers the Power Bill to be included in the Debt Service Coverage Ratio 
calcs in the Credit Agreement.  The remainder of the Natural Gas Fuel will be 
distributed under the Capacity Allocation Agreement to avoid the inclusive of 
these excess amounts in any distribution tests under the Credit Agreement.

3.  Since more significant changes were made to the Admin. Services 
Agreement, it is now being amended and restated.

Gerald,

In reviewing the changes I need to see what the "Firm Schedules" are.  This
looks like it is new and is apparently part of the Firm gathering
agreements.  Also, would it be possible to get a red-line version of the
documents that compares these latest changes with the originally executed
documents as I think some of the interim changes have been absorbed already.
Give me a call if you need any clarification.  713-624-9003.

Shonnie,  I believe Brian left you a voicemail about this. Here is the latest 
from Hanover.  These guys are trying to renegotiate this deal.  Lets talk 
about this after you have had a chance to review.

Gerald,

Wanted to keep you in the loop on where Hanover would like to see things 
going with our contract.  They've been complaining almost from day 1 and 
their format is getting a little more formal and aggressive as seen in the 
attached spreadsheet and memo.  The attached memo in my opinion violates in 
several points made the spirit of the intent of the agreement as executed.  
The guy that put this together (Jerry Griffith) was not a Hanover employee 
when the contract was negotiated.  I believe he is being put up to this by 
his management who appear to want to change some very fundamental things that 
were agreed to (most of which were explicitly spelled out in the document).  
No action requested of you I just wanted you to be informed. Thanks

Ken

this is our strawman, best shot at a methodology to get started;
pls comment,
I would like to proceed with this and try to get together in Denver

Bob,  Attached is the scope of work.  I gave you the hard copy earlier.
Attached are the form of confirm that are being executed for the Gallup 
Amendments.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I have also attached the 
TW gas letter agreement which I had forward earlier.  These are all the 
operational docs. required for the amendment.


For completeness,  Attached are the operational documents that reflect the 
Gallup Amendments.  The Gas Price Letter reflects TW's agreement to provide 
incremental gas volumes.  The confirms to the existing Enfolio deals reflect 
the value for the gas which flows from Enron North America Corp. to Enron 
Compression Services Corp. and finally to the LLC.    The confirms done with 
the original Gallup Transaction are not being amended.  New confirms are 
being added to handle the incremental gas from TW.  Please let me know if you 
have any questions.

Dan,  I have reviewed the Wildhorse (Mesa) Gathering, Processing, and 
Transport Agreement.  This agreement is still valid and the gas is dedicated 
to this Agreement through 2013.  The agreement present some problematic 
issues which I will outline.

 1. Gas Quality -  The gas quality provisions only require Wildhorse to 
transport the gas if the gas meets the downstream carriers (in this case 
Northwest Pipeline) gas quality specifications.  We propose to put in a 
treating plant which would allow the gas to meet the specifications, however 
there are no provision in this Agreement which allow us to insert a plant 
between Northwest Pipeline and Wildhorse.  Wildhorse could delay are extract 
value from us for this connection.  This is an uncertainty.

 2.  Wildhorse Obligation to Perform - Based on my understanding of the 
facts, at some point during the term of this agreement, Northwest Pipeline 
enforced their gas quality specifications and refused to take the gas at the 
downstream side of Wildhorse's Gathering System. As a result, Wildhorse shut 
in Enogex's production and it has been shut in ever since.  Wildhorse has a 
right to do this under this Agreement (see #1 above) and therefore Wildhorse 
has not breached its obligation to transport under this Agreement.  
Wildhorse's obligation was suspended when Northwest refused receipt of the 
gas.

 3.  Unprofitability - Assuming Wildhorse worked with us to install the 
treating plant which conformed the gas to Northwest Specifications, they 
could refuse to provide gathering service under this agreement if it was 
still uneconomical for them to do so.  If they decided it is uneconomical for 
them to do so, they have the right to provide Enogex with various potential 
solutions which include (i) renegotiating the terms (ii) allowing Enogex to 
operate Wildhorse's equipment at Enogex sole cost, expense and risk, or (iii) 
release the gas from the Agreement.  The problem here is that there is no 
time limit under which Wildhorse must reach a solution with us and no 
specific solution they must reach.   Wildhorse could drag this out for some 
extended period of time and they could extract significant value.


My  recommendation is that we make Enogex's resolution of these issues with 
Wildhorse a condition precedent to closing and funding this deal. I know the 
timing is late.  However if Enron funds this deal and takes on the risk of 
negotiating with Wildhorse to resolve either a new deal or a release of the 
gas,  everyone needs to understand that such negotiation could take 
substantial time and Wildhorse will have significant leverage.   

Let me know if you wish to discuss this further or have any questions.  Have a great trip and try not to hook up with too many Italian hotties!  Must 
come back with lots of pictures and potentially a few life changing 
experiences.Attached are executables for the Hubbard Transaction.

Cheryl will also be faxing revised exhibits to the agreement for your review.


Heidi,  Attached is the modified confirm form.  Please note the following:

1.  This will only work with an Interruptible all points master contract
2.  This confirm cannot extend the term of a transport agreement.  We need to 
make sure that the master is still in its term.
3.  The counter -party should sign off for every transaction.  Via fax 
signature is acceptable.
4.  A single form per contract must be used.
5.  This form is set up for 1 month or less deals.

We need to make sure this confirm can be handle under the existing global 
contract # for the master contract.

Gerald -

Where do you stand on reviewing the Gregg agreement?  Just a quick update, 
please.

Thanks,
Chris Sonneborn
HPL Facility Planning
Chris attached is a clean and redline version of the Gregg Agreement with my 
revisions.  The form Gregg sent was the original form they had forwarded for 
the first project.  I change to reflect the change we made at that time.  As 
you will notice it is quite a few changes.  However, since Gregg signed off 
on this form once already, they shouldn't have a problem doing it again.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.
I reviewed the draft you forwarded.  Looks good.  I have the following two 
questions:  

Section 1.1 - The fourth sentence down in the parenthesis "(whether owned or 
leased by LESSEE)".  Shouldn't that read "(whether owned, operated, or leased 
by LESSEE)" since Mariner only operates the Property for MEGS?

Term  -  Shouldn't the term mirror the term for the Production Handling 
Agreement?  Section 7.1.2.e allows termination after January 1, 2005.  Why 
would Marathon want to terminate while the PHA is still in effect?

PANEL:
 [*1]  Before Commissioners: James J. Hoecker, Chairman; Vicky A. Bailey,
William L. Massey, Linda Breathitt, and Curt Hebert, Jr.

OPINION:

   On March 2, 1998, Clear Creek Storage Company, L.L.C. (Clear Creek) file=
d=20
an
application pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), for a
certificate to convert a natural gas production reservoir to a natural gas
storage facility, to construct appurtenant facilities, and to operate the
storage field and related facilities for the sole use of Clear Creek's two
owners, Questar Energy Trading Company (Questar Energy) and Montana Power
Ventures, Inc. (Montana Power). Clear Creek requests that, to the extent
feasible, the authorization granted to it be a limited jurisdiction=20
certificate.
Clear Creek also requests waivers of various Commission regulations and
requirements.

   For the reasons discussed below, we will grant Clear Creek's request for
authorization to convert the production reservoir to a gas storage facility=
=20
and
to construct and operate facilities. However, we will require Clear Creek t=
o
operate the facility on an open access basis.

I. Background

   Questar Energy and Montana Power formed Clear Creek to own and operate t=
he
proposed Clear Creek storage [*2]  project. Questar Energy owns 75 percent =
and
Montana Power owns 25 percent of Clear Creek. Questar Energy is a wholly-ow=
ned
subsidiary of Questar Corporation and a natural gas marketing affiliate of
Questar Pipeline Company, an interstate pipeline. Questar Energy engages in
marketing of natural gas, crude oil, and electricity. It purchases natural =
gas
from affiliated production companies and unaffiliated companies.

   Montana Power is an affiliate of Montana Power Company, an electric and =
gas
utility regulated by the Commission as well as the State of Montana. Montan=
a
Power engages in natural gas business development, which will include=20
purchasing
and selling natural gas upon approval of Clear Creek's application.

Clear Creek states that both Questar Energy and Montana Power plan to activ=
ely
purchase and sell natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region, and elsewhere i=
n=20
the
United States. Therefore, they both wish to develop storage capabilities to
better manage their natural gas supplies, including the balancing of their

respective natural gas supplies and supply acquisition opportunities with
current and projected demand for natural gas. Clear Creek states that the
storage capacity will [*3]  assist Questar Energy and Montana Power to buy =
and
sell gas when it is most economically favorable to do so, to offer more=20
reliable
supply products to potential customers, and to manage transportation=20
obligations
to minimize exposure to penalties and cashout charges.

   Clear Creek proposes to locate its storage project in the depleted Nugge=
t
reservoir in the Clear Creek Field in Uinta County, Wyoming, an active natu=
ral
gas production region. Chevron, Inc. discovered the field in 1978. The fiel=
d
produced gas from 1979 until 1994 when it was shut-in after production of o=
il
and gas from the field was no longer economic. Prior to shut-in, 15 wells
produced natural gas that was delivered through existing pipeline facilitie=
s
into Northwest Pipeline Corporation, Kern River Gas Transmission Company, a=
nd
Questar Pipeline Company.

   Clear Creek states that the interconnecting pipeline taps, laterals,
gathering facilities and wells are still in place and, with minor=20
modifications,
will be used to transport gas in and out of the proposed storage facility.

   Questar Energy has owned and operated the Clear Creek field since late=

1993,
having acquired it from its affiliate, Universal Resources Corporation [*4]
(Universal), a natural gas producer. Universal tested the field in 1996 and=

II. Proposal

Clear Creek proposes to convert a reservoir in the Nugget formation in a
depleted natural gas production field in the Clear Creek Participation Area=
=20
(PA)
of the Painter Reservoir Unit to a gas storage facility. The Clear Creek PA=
 is
located in Uinta County, Wyoming, approximately 15 miles northeast of=20
Evanston.
The proposed project would reuse facilities in place within the Clear Creek=
 PA
from previous activities [*5]  in Sections 4 and 9 of the production field.
Lands in Section 4 are administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) =
and
lands in Section 9 are owned privately by Uinta Livestock Grazing Partnersh=
ip.

   The Nugget formation is located at an approximate depth of 8700 feet and
storage will be water driven. Clear Creek expects to operate the storage
reservoir at a pressure of approximately 3200 psi. Clear Creek proposes to
develop 4 Bcf of working storage capacity, supported by 2 to 4 Bcf of cushi=
on
gas. Questar Energy and Montana Power will supply cushion gas in proportion=
 to
their membership interests. The project is expected to have a maximum gas
=0F,                                                                       =
  =20
PAGE 3
                 84 F.E.R.C. P61,210; 1998 FERC LEXIS 1726, *5

injection capability of up to 35 MMcf/day (at approximately 4200 psi) and a
maximum withdrawal capability of up to 50 MMcf/day (at approximately 750 ps=
i).

   Clear Creek states that it will own and be responsible for operating the
storage project. Under the Construction, Operation and Management Agreement
between Clear Creek, Questar Energy and Montana Power, Clear Creek will=20
contract
with Questar Energy to operate the field on a day to day basis.

   A. Facilities

   Clear Creek states that conversion of the field to storage will require
minimal construction [*6]  and will enable it to maximize the use of existi=
ng
facilities that were installed in connection with previous exploration and
production activity at the field.

   Clear Creek proposes to use a single, existing well (#44-4) for injectio=
ns
and withdrawals and up to 8 existing wells for monitoring. Clear Creek expe=
cts
to use the existing roads, pipeline facilities, buildings, fencing,
rights-of-way, pads, and cleared areas, and some of the existing storage=20
tanks.

   Clear Creek proposes to install the following new facilities:

   two 2100-hp compressors (possibly leased), which will be installed in an
existing building designed and historically used for compressors;

   one Joule-Thompson Liquid Extraction Plant (skid mounted), which will be
located in an already cleared, fenced site;

   new insulation, wrapping and electric heat tracing for the existing
injection/withdrawal line that connects the injection/withdrawal well to th=
e
compressor building;

   one 30,000-gallon natural gas liquids storage tank, located in an existi=
ng
cleared, fenced site;

   a skid-mounted production unit to separate water and free hydrocarbon=20
liquids
from the production stream during withdrawal operations;

   two additional 400-barrel [*7]  water tanks, to be located in pre-distur=
bed
sites;

   new 3.5-inch tubing in the injection/withdrawal well, #44-4, inside the
existing 5.5-inch casing; and communications and monitoring equipment.

   Clear Creek anticipates that it also will be necessary to modify existin=
g
pipeline facilities that connect the field to Questar Pipeline. Clear Creek
expects Questar Pipeline to replace, under its blanket construction=20
certificate,
approximately 50 feet of 4-inch pipe and meter run with an equivalent lengt=
h=20
of
6-inch pipe and meter run. Clear Creek requests authority to modify its lin=
e
connected to the Clear Creek Field to accommodate those modifications by=20
Questar
Pipeline.

   Clear Creek states that, historically, gas was delivered from the field=
=20
into
Questar Pipeline, and was received from and delivered back to Questar Pipel=
ine
during Universal's well tests. Clear Creek submits that, in the future, it
=0F,                                                                       =

expects to receive gas from and deliver gas to other pipelines in the area,
including Northwest Pipeline Corporation and Kern River. However, Clear Cre=
ek
does not seek approval at this time to construct any facilities necessary t=
o
implement these additional receipt and delivery points.

   B. Services [*8]

   Clear Creek proposes to render storage services solely for its two membe=
rs,
Questar Energy and Montana Power, which will receive storage capacity right=
s=20
in
direct proportion to their ownership interests, i.e., Questar Energy will h=
ave
use of 75 percent of the field's storage capacity and Montana Power will ha=
ve
use of 25 percent of the capacity. Questar Energy and Montana Power will al=
so
have firm use of injection and withdrawal capabilities totaling 35 MMcf/d a=
nd=20
50
MMcf/d, respectively, on a percentage basis equal to the share of storage
capacity rights. Each will have a right to unused injection and withdrawal
capabilities on an interruptible basis.

Clear Creek proposes to provide no storage service to any entity other than=
=20
its
owners. Questar Energy and Montana Power will each own and store its own ga=
s=20
in
the capacity it holds.

   C. Requested Waivers

   Clear Creek states that it neither requests nor desires a blanket=20
certificate
to transport for others. Therefore, Clear Creek requests the Commission to=
=20
waive
any requirement that the proposed project be operated on an open access bas=
is.

   Clear Creek submits that its proposal is different from the situations
presented in two cases,  [*9]  Total Peaking Services, L.L.C. (Total Peakin=
g)=20
n2
and Hopkinton LNG Corporation (Hopkinton), n3 in which the Commission rejec=
ted
private storage proposals involving existing liquid natural gas (LNG)=20
facilities
belonging to local distribution companies (LDCs) and required the applicant=
s=20
to
provide open access storage. Unlike those cases, Clear Creek maintains, its
proposed project is not located in a market area but in a supply area=20
surrounded
by both major production areas and major interstate pipelines. In addition,=
=20
the
reservoir Clear Creek proposes to convert to storage was not previously
developed by a regulated LDC or any other form of regulated entity and thus
there are no risks of cross-subsidies by ratepayers. Further, submits Clear
Creek, there are no concerns about an affiliated LDC engaging in capacity
brokering to deliver gas to or from market area LNG plants, a unique market
advantage described by the Commission in Total Peaking.

   Further, Clear Creek argues, its proposal is for a small, low budget=20
project
which cannot readily be increased in size to accommodate new demands for=20
storage
from a third-party without a great increase in associated costs and, to a=

PAGE 5
                 84 F.E.R.C. P61,210; 1998 FERC LEXIS 1726, *10

the quantity of storage available to Questar Energy and Montana Power would
undermine their incentives to proceed. Clear Creek states that the project'=
s
costs would increase due to the sizable regulatory burdens associated with
preparing and maintaining tariffs, ratemaking, utility-based accounting
practices, reporting, GISB, EBBs, additional personnel, and=20
marketing-affiliate
rules requiring separation of Clear Creek from its two marketer owners.=20
Further,
it contends, an open access requirement would expose it to economic risks a=
nd
third-party liability issues such as risks of gas loss, force majeure, proj=
ect
failure, and credit that do not exist for a project that would only serve i=
ts
two owners.

Accordingly, Clear Creek requests waivers of all reporting requirements,
including the obligation to file Form 2 or similar reports; any obligation =
to
file rates, tariffs,  [*11]  contracts, or contract amendments; any obligat=
ion
to justify rates on any basis other than those the parties negotiated as pa=

IV. Discussion

   A. Jurisdiction

   Since the proposed facilities will be used for the transportation of=20
natural
gas in interstate commerce subject to the Commission's jurisdiction, the
requested authorization is subject to section 7(c) of the NGA.

   B. Public Convenience and Necessity

Commission
make an exception for its storage proposal, and not require it to provide o=

that such proposals are not in the public interest.

   Clear Creek seeks to distinguish its proposal from those in Hopkinton an=
d
Total Peaking by noting that, unlike those two proposals, its proposed stor=
age
facility is not in the market area and does not raise cross-subsidization o=
r
capacity brokering issues. We recognize that those issues are not present i=
n
Clear Creek's proposal. Nevertheless, its proposal is the same in one=20
overriding
aspect. Clear Creek seeks authorization to perform jurisdictional interstat=
e
transportation with no requirement that such service be offered on an
open-access basis. Such proposals are inconsistent with the regulatory goal=
s
embodied in Order No. 636, which was intended to encourage interstate=20
pipelines
to provide open-access services, including storage. Therefore, we will requ=
ire
Clear Creek to restructure its proposal into one that is consistent with th=
e
principles of Order No. 636. Specifically, we will issue Clear Creek a Part=
=20
284
blanket transportation certificate conditioned on Clear Creek's filing, wit=
hin
60 days of the date of issuance of this order, a revised Exhibit P to its
application, setting forth its proposed tariff and initial rates along with
supporting schedules for open-access firm [*14]  and interruptible storage
service and storage-related transportation that comply with the requirement=
s=20
of
Part 284 and with the Commission's restructuring rules as expressed in Orde=
r=20
No.
636.

   To the extent Clear Creek seeks to charge market-based rates, it must ma=
ke=20
a
showing that it lacks market power. The Commission has issued several order=
s
that provide guidance on the criteria it uses to evaluate market-based rate
proposals. n7 In addition, an applicant's market-based study should be
consistent with the Commission's policy statement on ratemaking n8 and must
show, among other things, that: (a) the relevant market provides good
alternatives to the applicant and is not defined too broadly; (b) the
alternatives are timely; (c) the applicant is not able to exercise market=
=20
power
over the price of the product; and (d) the quality of service is equivalent=
.
Clear Creek should provide this information in the tariff filing required=

above.

   Clear Creek requests a limited jurisdiction certificate. The Commission
issues such certificates to allow nonjurisdictional parties to engage in=20
certain
jurisdictional activities without affecting the status of their otherwise
nonjurisdictional activities. Since Clear Creek's sole function is to provi=
de
interstate storage services, there is no need to issue Clear Creek a limite=
d
jurisdiction certificate. However, we clarify that the authorization grante=
d=20
to
Clear Creek will not affect the nonjurisdictional status of Questar Energy =
or
Montana Power.

   Because we are approving a Part 284 blanket certificate rather than the
limited jurisdiction certificate Clear Creek requested, Clear Creek must=20
comply
with the accounting and reporting requirements applicable to other natural =
gas
companies providing Part 284 service. Accordingly, we deny Clear Creek's=20
request
for waiver of those requirements.

   We will not require Clear Creek to hold an open season since it has
agreements [*16]  with Questar Energy and Montana Power for all of the=20
capacity
of its proposed storage facility and no party has protested the arrangement=
.
Clear Creek's concern that an open- access requirement for its storage=20
facility
would require it to enlarge its project is unfounded. There is no requireme=
nt=20
to
offer more capacity than exists or to increase a facility's capacity to
accommodate potential customers. An open-access transporter need only offer=
 on
an open-access basis existing capacity for which it has no contracts. In th=
is
regard, we note that the agreement between Clear Creek and its two owners i=
s=20
for
all of the existing capacity for a term of twenty years.

   Finally, we note that Clear Creek may apply for a Part 157 blanket
certificate under which it could undertake future modifications to the stor=
age
facilities and operations.

   C. Engineering

   The Commission has evaluated Clear Creeks's proposal and concludes that =
the
development of the Clear Creek reservoir as an underground gas storage fiel=
d=20
is
feasible. We also evaluated the proposed storage design, facilities, capaci=
ty
and injection/withdrawal estimates and do not foresee any technical problem=
s
regarding the development of this [*17]  field.

   Accordingly, in view of these circumstances, we will require that:

   1. The maximum inventory of natural gas stored in Clear Creek shall not
exceed 8.0 Bcf at 14.73 psia and 60 degrees F, and the maximum shut-in bott=
om
hole reservoir pressure shall not exceed 5500 psig, without prior Commissio=
n
authorization; and
=0F,                                                                       =

PAGE 8
                 84 F.E.R.C. P61,210; 1998 FERC LEXIS 1726, *17


2. Clear Creek shall submit semiannual reports in accordance with section
157.214(c) of the regulations. These reports shall continue to be filed unt=
il
one year after the storage inventory volume has reached or closely=20
approximates
8 Bcf.

 D. Environmental Assessment


   The Commission prepared an environmental assessment (EA) for Clear Creek=
's
proposal. The EA addresses construction procedures, geology, soils, water
resources, wetlands, vegetation, wildlife, hydrostatic testing, federally=
=20
listed
threatened and endangered species, cultural resources, land use, air and no=
ise
quality, and alternatives.

   Based on the discussion in the EA, we conclude that if constructed in
accordance with Clear Creek's application and supplements filed on April 8 =
and
May 20, 1998, approval of this proposal would not constitute a major Federa=
l
action significantly affecting the quality [*18]  of the human environment.

   As recommended in the EA, this authorization includes the following
conditions:

   1. Clear Creek shall follow the construction procedures and mitigation
measures described in its application and supplements (including responses =
to
staff data requests) and as identified in the EA. Clear Creek must:

   a. request any modifications to these procedures, measures, or condition=
s=20
in
a filing with the Secretary of the Commission;

   b. justify each modification relative to site- specific conditions;

   c. explain how that modification provides an equal or greater level of
environmental protection than the original measure; and

d. receive approval in writing from the Director of Office of Pipeline
Regulation (OPR) before using that modification.

   2. The Director of OPR has delegated authority to take whatever steps ar=
e
necessary to ensure protection of all environmental resources during
construction and operation of the project. This authority shall allow:

   a. the modification of conditions of this Order; and b. the design and
implementation of any additional measures deemed necessary (including stop=
=20
work
authority) to assure continued compliance with the intent of the environmen=
tal
[*19]  conditions as well as the avoidance or mitigation of adverse
environmental impact resulting from project construction and operation.

   Any state or local permits issued with respect to the jurisdictional
facilities authorized herein must be consistent with the conditions of this
certificate. The Commission encourages cooperation between natural gas=20
companies
and local authorities. However, this does not mean that state and local
agencies, through application of state or local laws, may prohibit or
unreasonably delay the construction or operation of facilities approved by=
=20
this
Commission. n9

OPINION:

   On December 3, 1991, Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc. (Texas-Ohio) filed an
application pursuant to section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) and Parts=
=20
157
and 284 of the Commission's regulations for certificates of public convenie=
nce
and necessity to operate its facilities in interstate commerce and to perfo=
rm
open-access transportation services on existing facilities known as the Hun=
ter
Pipeline in Garrard County, Kentucky. Texas-Ohio also requested a temporary
certificate to operate the Hunter Pipeline on an interim basis pending=20
issuance
of a permanent certificate.

   On January 15, 1992, the Commission issued Texas-Ohio a temporary=20
certificate
authorizing service to existing customers utilizing the Hunter Pipeline; th=
e
temporary certificate is to expire upon issuance of a final Commission orde=
r=20
on
the request for a permanent blanket certificate. n1 On February 14, 1992,
Industrial Energy Services Company (IESCO) sought rehearing of the January =
15
order.

   n1 Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 58 FERC 61,025 (1992).

   We will grant Texas-Ohio [*2]  a case-specific certificate pursuant to P=
art
157, subpart A of the Commission's regulations to operate the Hunter Pipeli=
ne=20
in
interstate commerce and a blanket transportation certificate pursuant to Pa=
rt
284, subpart G of the Commission's regulations. These authorizations are ma=

Background

   The Hunter Pipeline is an interconnection between facilities of Tennesse=
e=20
Gas
Pipeline Company (Tennessee) and TETCO. It consists of two 1,000 horsepower
compressors and approximately 600 feet of above-ground 10-inch diameter gas
pipeline. The Hunter Pipeline is capable of transporting 60,000 Mcf per day=
 of
natural gas.  [*4]

   Texas-Ohio constructed the Hunter Pipeline pursuant to a certificate iss=
ued
by the Kentucky Public Service Commission (Kentucky PSC) on November 19, 19=
90.
This authorization designated Texas-Ohio as an intrastate pipeline operatin=
g=20
as
a transporting utility. However, because Texas-Ohio did not hold an=20
open-season
prior to commencing transportation operations, only Texas-Ohio Gas, Inc. an=
d=20
its
sales customers acquired capacity on the Hunter Pipeline. n4 After=20
constructing
the facilities, Texas-Ohio filed an application with the Commission in Dock=
et
No. PR91-5-000 seeking approval of rates under section 311(a)(2) of the=20
Natural
Gas Policy Act (NGPA). The Commission instituted rate proceedings on April =
29,
1991 to determine whether Texas-Ohio's rates were fair and equitable. n5

   n4 Texas-Ohio is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Texas-Ohio Gas, Inc. (TOG)=
, a
Houston-based marketer that ships Gulf Coast gas to northeastern industrial
end-users via Tennessee and TETCO. Prior to construction of the Hunter=20
Pipeline,
TOG faced separate bottlenecks on the Tennessee and TETCO systems during th=
e
winter heating season; the location and capacity of the Hunter Pipeline was
selected to avoid these bottlenecks.

   On June 3, 1991, Texas-Ohio suspended transportation service through the
Hunter Pipeline upon discovering that the gas being moved through those
facilities was not produced in Kentucky and, therefore, that it was engaged=

the interstate transportation of natural gas without authorization under NG=
A
section 7 or NGPA section 311. Subsequently, the Commission instituted an
investigation into the construction and operation of the Hunter Pipeline. T=
hat
investigation determined that from the first day of operation on December 1=
,
1990 through its voluntary shut-down on June 3, 1991, the Hunter Pipeline
transported gas in interstate commerce. n6 On October 19, 1993, the Commiss=
ion
approved a stipulation and consent agreement in which Texas-Ohio agreed to=
=20
pay a
$ 125,000 civil penalty and to implement a program to comply with the NGA a=
nd
NGPA. n7

   n6 Texas-Ohio received all the gas that flowed through the Hunter Pipeli=
ne
from Tennessee's interstate facility. Texas-Ohio then redelivered the gas t=
o
TETCO's interstate facility.

   n7 Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 65 FERC 61,069 (1993).Proposal

   Texas-Ohio requests authorization to operate its facilities in interstat=
e
[*6]  commerce and perform open-access transportation service. Texas-Ohio
proposes to charge firm shippers a transportation rate consisting of a
reservation charge of $ 1.4813 per MMBtu and a commodity charge of $ 0.0103=
=20
per
MMBtu.

   Interruptible shippers would pay a transportation rate consisting of a
commodity charge of $ 0.059 per MMBtu. n8n8 The proposed initial rates are =
the
same as those which Texas-Ohio was authorized to charge during the=20
effectiveness
of the temporary certificate. Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 58 FERC 61,025 at
61,059 (1992).


   Texas-Ohio states that operation of the Hunter Pipeline will permit=20
shippers
to avoid bottlenecks on the systems of Tennessee and TETCO. TETCO's bottlen=
eck
is located at a point near the Kentucky-Tennessee border. Due to this
constraint, TETCO has historically curtailed the interruptible transportati=
on=20
of
natural gas from receipt points located south of the Kentucky- Tennessee=20
border
that is destined for delivery to points north during the winter heating=20
season.
During the past three winter seasons, TETCO has curtailed interruptible
transportation for gas originating upstream of its Mt. Pleasant compressor
station [*7]  in Tennessee that is scheduled for delivery downstream to Zon=
es=20
C
and D.

   The bottleneck on Tennessee's system occurs in Mercer County, Pennsylvan=
ia.
As a result, gas produced and transported from receipt points south of Merc=
er
County cannot be transported to points north of Mercer County during certai=
n
periods of the year. During the past four winter seasons, Tennessee has
curtailed gas moving on an interruptible basis from points upstream of=20
stations
219, 237, and 313 to locations downstream of those stations.

   Texas-Ohio's facilities are positioned to avoid both bottlenecks. In thi=
s
regard, Tennessee typically has interruptible transportation capacity for
deliveries to Texas- Ohio's facilities, but has bottlenecks downstream of i=
ts
interconnection with Texas-Ohio. Conversely, TETCO has a bottleneck upstrea=
m=20
of
Texas-Ohio's facilities, but has capacity for the movement of interruptible
transportation volumes downstream of its Mt. Pleasant compressor station. A=
s
such, Texas-Ohio's facilities can be utilized to alleviate bottlenecks on t=

different pipeline systems and thereby move gas to markets in the Northeast=
.

Discussion

   The Commission finds that by utilizing the Hunter [*8]  Pipeline shipper=
s
located upstream of the TETCO bottleneck can utilize Tennessee's system to=
=20
move
gas to Texas-Ohio for redelivery to TETCO and continued transportation
downstream. Shippers upstream of Tennessee's bottleneck, but downstream of
Texas-Ohio's facilities, can, by displacement, utilize Texas-Ohio's system =
to
access the TETCO system for continued transportation downstream. This
arrangement will avoid both the upstream and downstream bottlenecks and all=
ow
continued delivery of gas to various northeast markets located off both the
TETCO and Tennessee systems. We find that the public convenience and necess=
ity
requires issuance of a certificate pursuant to Part 157, subpart A,=20
authorizing
operation of Texas-Ohio's Hunter Pipeline.

   The Commission also finds that Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff generally
complies with the requirements for a Part 284 blanket transportation
certificate. Accordingly, we will grant Texas- Ohio's application for a Par=
t=20
284
blanket transportation certificate, subject to the conditions set forth her=
ein
to ensure Texas-Ohio's full compliance with the conditions of Order Nos. 63=
6,
497, and 566. Texas-Ohio's Part 284 blanket certificate will become effecti=
ve
[*9]  upon Texas-Ohio's full compliance with these conditions.


I. Rates

   Texas-Ohio proposes to charge the initial rates that were approved in th=
e
temporary certificate. Under this proposal, firm shippers would pay a
transportation rate consisting of a reservation charge of $ 1.4813 per MMBt=
u=20
and
a commodity charge of $ 0.0103 per MMBtu. Interruptible shippers would pay =
a
transportation rate consisting of a commodity charge of $ 0.059 per MMBtu. =
The
proposed rates are based on the modified fixed variable rate design (MFV), =
100
percent equity capitalization, a 15 percent return on equity, and a 10 perc=
ent
depreciation. The reservation and usage charges are based on 100 percent of=
=20
the
system design capacity.

A. Rate Design

   Order No. 636 requires pipelines to use the straight fixed variable (SFV=
)
rate design methodology. n9 Texas-Ohio has not provided any evidence which=
=20
would
support an exception to this requirement. Accordingly, we find that Texas-O=
hio
should be required to use the SFV rate design methodology. Additionally, si=
nce
Texas-Ohio's cost of service does not include any variable costs, we will
require it to use $ 0.0000 as the minimum FTS usage and ITS rates. n10

   n9 See 18 C.F.R. 284.7(d).

   n10 See Gateway Pipeline Co., 55 FERC 61,488 (1991). [*10]  B.=20
Capitalization
and Rate of Return

   Texas-Ohio proposes a capitalization consisting of 100 percent equity. W=
e
find that it is appropriate to use a hypothetical capital structure consist=
ing
of 57 percent debt and 43 percent equity; this structure is based on the 43=
.18
percent average equity ratio held by a group of seven major investor- owned
interstate pipelines at the end of 1993.
=0F,                                                                       =
  =20
PAGE 5
                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *10


   We have generally used recent rates for Baa-rated public utility bonds t=
o=20
set
the debt costs on similar projects since Baa is the prevailing rating for
pipeline bonds. The rate for Baa utility bonds averaged 8.40 percent for th=
e=20
six
months ending July 31, 1994, with a one month average of 8.80 percent for J=
uly
1994. We find it appropriate to utilize a cost of debt of 8.50 percent.

   Texas-Ohio's proposed 15 percent rate of return on equity is excessive
considering the prevailing cost of capital. We find acceptable a rate of=20
return
derived from a range of returns based upon an analysis of recent interest=
=20
rates
and a discounted cash flow (DCF) study. The lower end of the range is=20
determined
by the prevailing Baa rating for public utility bonds; as discussed above, =
we
will use a figure of 8.50 percent for [*11]  the most recent six months. Si=
nce
equity is riskier than debt, 100 basis points should be added to the bond=
=20
rate,
thus bringing the lower end of the range to 9.50 percent.

   The upper end of the range is determined by a DCF analysis of a proxy gr=
oup
of seven publicly held natural gas transmission companies. n11 This proxy=
=20
group
is used because the DCF methodology requires market price data as an input =
in
the estimation of investor-expected equity returns. The DCF analysis for th=
e
proxy group results in a range of equity returns of 10.77 percent to 13.41
percent, with a median return of 12.19 percent.

   n11 Coastal Corporation, El Paso Natural Gas Company, Enron Corporation,
Panhandle Eastern, Sonat Inc., Transco Energy, and Williams Companies, Inc.

   This analysis uses dividend yields and forecasts of long- term growth ra=
tes
as follows. For the first five years, the Institutional Brokerage Estimate
System (IBES) estimates of five year growth in earnings per share was used.=
=20
For
longer-term growth (for the years 2000-2010), estimates taken from DRI/McGr=
aw
Hill (Energy Review, Spring-Summer 1994) for growth in the natural gas=20
industry
were used. A growth rate for each company in the [*12]  proxy group was
determined by averaging the two growth rates. Combining the bottom and top
figures establishes a range of 9.50 percent to 13.41 percent. The midpoint =
of
this range is approximately 11.50 percent.

   The Hunter Pipeline went into initial operation in 1990 and faces no
construction risk. Accordingly, we find that the company's risk is no highe=
r
than that of the average pipeline. Therefore, we will require a rate of ret=
urn
on equity of 11.5 percent, which is equal to the midpoint of the range of
reasonableness.

C. Depreciation

   Texas-Ohio proposes a book depreciation rate of 10 percent calculated on=
=20
the
straight-line method which supports an economic life of 10 years. We believ=
e
that the economic life of the Hunter Pipeline will depend upon gas reserves
connected to the Tennessee system and the future demand for natural gas
downstream of those facilities. We are confident that market demand and
operation of Tennessee and TETCO to service downstream markets in the=20
Northeast
States will continue for the next 25 years. We also believe that the Hunter
Pipeline will operate on a permanent basis and play an important role in th=
e
delivery of gas, especially during high demand [*13]  periods. Based on the=
se
factors, we find that an economic life of 25 years should be used to=20
calculate a
depreciation rate of four percent for the Hunter Pipeline facilities.
=0F,                                                                       =

D. Conclusion

   We will require Texas-Ohio to modify its rates as follows. For=20
interruptible
service, the minimum rate shall be $ 0.0000; the maximum rate shall be $=20
0.0518.
For firm service, the minimum reservation charge shall be $ 0.0000; the=20
maximum
reservation charge shall be $ 1.5749. The usage charge for firm service sha=
ll=20
be
$ 0.0000. n12 The rates approved herein are initial rates under NGA section=
 7;
their approval does not constitute approval of any underlying rate=20
methodology,
principle, or concept to be used in any general rate change filed pursuant =
to
NGA section 4. These initial rates will remain in effect until such time as
Texas-Ohio files an NGA section 4 general rate proceeding. At that time, an=
y
party or the Commission staff may propose new rates based on different
methodologies, principles or concepts.

   n12 All rates are expressed per MMBtu.

   II. Pro Forma Tariff

Texas-Ohio has applied for a blanket transportation certificate under secti=
on
284.221 of the Commission's regulations. It  [*14]  proposes to provide bot=
h
firm and interruptible transportation service. To commence service under a
blanket certificate, Texas-Ohio must file and place into effect rates, term=
s,
and conditions that are consistent with Part 284 of the regulations.=20
Texas-Ohio
has not made a tariff filing in this proceeding; it has, however, filed pro
forma tariff sheets which indicate the form its tariff will take. Generally=
,=20
the
pro forma tariff conforms to the Commission's requirements. As discussed=20
below,
however, certain provisions are either inconsistent with the Commission's
policies or are not adequately justified. Certain specific changes that we=
=20
will
require to be made to Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff are set forth in an=20
appendix
to this order.

A. Order No. 636

   Review of Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff indicates a number of changes th=
at
must be implemented to satisfy the requirements of Order No. 636. To implem=
ent
those changes, Texas-Ohio must make a tariff filing within 45 days of the d=
ate
of the issuance of this order. Also, Texas-Ohio is reminded that while cert=
ain
provisions of Order No. 636 may not apply at this time, future changes in i=
ts
operations may require tariff revisions to satisfy [*15]  the requirements =
of
that Order.

1. Equality of Service/Open Season

   Pipelines that offer open-access transportation service must provide tho=
se
services on a basis that is equal in quality for all gas suppliers, whether=
=20
the
gas is purchased from the pipeline or from another seller. Section=20
284.14(b)(iv)
of the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R. 284.14(b)(iv), requires a=20
pipeline's
tariff to reflect the principle of equality of service for all gas transpor=
ted
under each rate schedule.

   Texas-Ohio performs only unbundled transportation service; it does not
provide pipeline sales service. Texas-Ohio does, however, provide=20
transportation
service for its affiliated marketers, TOG and Texas-Ohio West, Inc. Origina=
l
Sheet No. 6, section 3.2, of Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff provides that
=0F,                                                                       =
  =20
PAGE 7
                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *15

customers with an already executed firm transportation contract for service=
 on
the Hunter Pipeline as of the effective date of the tariff shall have a=20
priority
over customers executing a service agreement at a later date. Service is
otherwise offered on a first-come, first-served basis. We find that this
provision gives preferential treatment to selected customers. It is unduly
discriminatory and must be [*16]  removed from the tariff. Further, we find=
=20
that
Texas-Ohio has never held an open-season or otherwise provided for the
non-discriminatory allocation of system capacity prior to initiating servic=
e.
Accordingly, we hold that Texas-Ohio must implement an open season within 3=
0
days of the date of issuance of an order in this proceeding to ensure non-
discriminatory allocation of system capacity.

2. Pregranted Abandonment and Right of First Refusal

   Section 284.221(d) of the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R. 284.221(d)=
,
authorizes pregranted abandonment of interruptible and short-term firm
transportation at the end of the contract. A short-term contract is one wit=
h a
term of less than one year. For long-term transportation with a term of mor=
e
than a year, section 284.14(b)(1)(xiii) requires the pipeline to establish=
=20
right
of first refusal procedures for use upon expiration of the long-term contra=
ct.
Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff does not comply with these requirements; it i=
s
directed to amend its tariff accordingly.

3. Capacity Release and Electronic Bulletin Board

   Section 284.243 of the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R. 284.243,=20
requires
interstate pipelines offering firm transportation [*17]  to establish a=20
capacity
release mechanism that allows firm shippers to release all or part of their=
=20
firm
transportation capacity rights to any person who wants to obtain that capac=
ity
by contracting with the pipeline. The release may be temporary, permanent, =
or
subject to conditions (i.e., on an interruptible basis). The pipeline must
allocate released capacity to the person offering the highest rate (not ove=
r=20
the
maximum rate) and offering to meet any other terms and conditions of the
release.

   Order No. 636 requires pipelines to provide timely and equal access to a=
ny
and all information necessary for buyers and sellers to arrange gas sales a=
nd
capacity release, including information regarding the availability of capac=
ity
at receipt and delivery points, and whether capacity is available from the
pipeline directly or through capacity releasing. This information must be=
=20
posted
on an electronic bulletin board (EBB).

   Texas-Ohio's proposed tariff lacks these provisions. It must amend its p=
ro
forma tariff to provide a capacity release mechanism and establish an EBB.

4. Upstream Capacity

Section 284.242 of the Commission's regulations, 18 C.F.R. 284.242, provide=
s
that an interstate [*18]  pipeline that offers transportation service on a=
=20
firm
basis under subparts B or G of Part 284 must offer, without undue
discrimination, to assign to its firm shippers its firm transportation=20
capacity,
including contract storage, on all upstream pipelines. Texas-Ohio does not
appear to hold any upstream capacity. In the tariff filing it is required t=
o
make to comply with the requirements of Order No. 636, Texas-Ohio should st=
ate
whether it holds any capacity on upstream pipelines. If it does, Texas-Ohio=
=20
must
=0F,                                                                       =
  =20
PAGE 8
                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *18

revise its tariff to comply with Order No. 636.

5. Transition Costs

   Texas-Ohio's filing predates Order No. 636 and consequently makes no=20
comment
regarding incurrence of transition costs. Accordingly, we will not make a
determination at this time with respect to Texas-Ohio's level of transition
costs. III. Docket No. MT94-2-000 Pursuant to our order of December 23, 199=
3,
Texas-Ohio filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. MT94-2-000 to comply w=
ith
the requirements of section 250.16(b), 18 C.F.R. 250.16(b). n13 With the
exception of the items discussed below, we find that Texas-Ohio's filing
complies with those requirements. n14

   n13 Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 65 FERC 61,387 (1993). Section 250.16 of =
the
Commission's regulations requires interstate natural gas pipelines that
transport natural gas for others pursuant to subparts B, G, H, or K of Part=
=20
284,
and that are affiliated in any way with a natural gas marketing or brokerin=
g
entity, to file certain information relevant to that relationship.

   n14 On June 17, 1994, Order No. 566 modified section 250.16(b) effective
August 1, 1994 by, among other things, eliminating the requirement that
pipelines (1) receive certain information from shippers in requests for
transportation service, (2) log and post on the EBB complaints made by=20
shippers,
and (3) include procedures to communicate pricing and capacity information.
 [*19]

   The tariff sheets filed by Texas-Ohio do not set forth the information
required to be filed in a transportation request. Texas-Ohio contends that=
=20
since
it is operating under a temporary certificate and is prohibited from provid=
ing
transportation service to new customers pending further action on its
application, that information is not applicable.

   While Order No. 566 eliminated certain information previously required t=
o=20
be
provided in the transportation request form, it still requires pipelines to
maintain a log of data used to allocate capacity. Texas-Ohio must comply wi=
th
this provision and file a transportation request form as specified.

   Texas-Ohio can address this deficiency by either revising existing tarif=
f
provisions, including its FTS and ITS request form, or by incorporating the
changes into Section 16 (Order No. 497 Compliance Procedures) of its propos=
ed
tariff. Texas-Ohio must make a compliance filing within 45 days of the=20
issuance
of this order incorporating all information required by Order Nos. 497 and=
=20
566.
Additionally, since the tariff sheets Texas-Ohio filed in Docket No.=20
MT94-2-000
are not pro forma, Texas-Ohio should filed corrected tariff sheets in a for=
m
[*20]  acceptable to become effective upon issuance of an order in this
proceeding.

IV.Environmental Matters

   On August 22, 1990, Texas-Ohio notified the Commission that it intended =
to
commence construction of the Hunter Pipeline and that the facilities would =
be
used for the transportation of natural gas under NGPA section 311(a)(2). Th=
is
notice provided the environmental information required by section 157.206(d=
)=20
of
the Commission's regulations.

=0F,                                                                       =

                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *20

   To ensure that operation of the Hunter Pipeline compressors complies wit=
h=20
the
noise requirements of section 157.206(d)(5), Texas-Ohio must perform a
post-construction sound survey of the compressor station. This survey must =
be
performed not later than 30 days after the date of issuance of this order. =
n15
Texas-Ohio's application for a Part 157, subpart A certificate to operate t=
he
Hunter Pipeline and a Part 284, subpart G blanket transportation certificat=
e
relies solely on the use of existing facilities; no additional construction
authorization is requested or granted. Accordingly, subject to Texas-Ohio's
compliance with section 157.206(d)(5), we conclude that approval of the=20
instant
application is not a major Federal action significantly affecting [*21]  th=
e
quality of the human environment.

   n15 Section 157.206(d)(5) provides that the noise attributable to any
compressor facility shall not exceed a day-night sound level of 55 dB(A) at=
=20
any
existing noise-sensitive areas.V. IESCO's Protest

   In its protest and request for an evidentiary hearing, IESCO charges tha=
t
Texas-Ohio's jurisdictional status must be determined as a precondition to =
the
issuance of a certificate.

   IESCO states that if Texas-Ohio was not a interstate pipeline for the=20
period
from November 1990 through June 3, 1991, it could not legally offer NGPA=20
section
311(a)(2) service and competing sellers of gas (such as IESCO) could have b=
een
unfairly deprived of their markets.

   The Commission's January 15, 1992 order issuing Texas-Ohio a temporary
certificate to operate the Hunter Pipeline laid to rest concerns regarding
Texas-Ohio's jurisdictional status. Further, Texas-Ohio agreed in the=20
settlement
approved in the Commission's October 18, 1993, order to comply with the NGA=
,
NGPA, and the Commission's regulations. This order issues Texas-Ohio a case=
-
specific certificate pursuant to subpart A of Part 157 and a blanket
transportation certificate pursuant to subpart G of [*22]  Part 284. No
questions remain as to the jurisdictional status of Texas-Ohio.

   IESCO then complains that Texas-Ohio should have held an open-season dur=
ing
which prospective shippers would have an opportunity to obtain services on =
the
Hunter Pipeline. As discussed above, the Commission has investigated
Texas-Ohio's operation and determined, among other things, that Texas-Ohio
notified only its marketing affiliate and the marketing affiliate's custome=
rs=20
of
the availability of capacity prior to construction of the Hunter Pipeline. =
The
Commission's policies require Texas-Ohio to use a non-discriminatory method=
 of
selecting customers for both firm and interruptible transportation service=
=20
when
operating under Part 284. n16 As noted above, we are holding that Texas-Ohi=
o
must hold an open season prior to commencing service under its Part 284=20
blanket
certificate. This approach will ensure that prior notice of firm capacity i=
s
made available to all interested parties on a contemporaneous basis and in =
a
non-discriminatory manner. n17

er,
and as conditioned herein, will subject Texas-Ohio to the full range of the
Commission's requirements, including those prohibiting discriminatory=20
practices.

   IESCO states that Texas-Ohio must be required to comply with the provisi=
ons
of the Affiliated Marketer Rule. As we noted in the order issuing a tempora=
ry
certificate, Order Nos. 497 and 497-A apply to all interstate pipelines wit=
h
affiliated marketers. Upon acceptance of the temporary certificate Texas- O=
hio
became subject to the conditions of those orders. n18 Texas-Ohio's standard=

conduct implementing Order No. 497, filed in Docket No. MG93-5-000, have be=

directions, Texas-Ohio will be in full compliance with Order No. 497.

Inc., 67 FERC 61,149 (1994). [*24]

   IESCO asserts that Texas-Ohio's proposed rates have not been shown to be
required by the present or future public convenience and necessity. It is
particularly concerned with the fact that Texas-Ohio seeks to depreciate it=
s
facilities over a ten-year period. As discussed above, we agree that
Texas-Ohio's proposed rates and ten-year depreciation period are=20
inappropriate,
and we have required adjustments to those figures as appropriate.

   IESCO also raises in its protest issues relating to Texas- Ohio's=20
application
for a temporary certificate. Those issues were addressed in our January 15,=
=20
1992
order issuing a temporary certificate. Issues raised by IESCO on rehearing =
of
that order are discussed below.

   In view of our disposition of the issues raised by IESCO, we find that=
=20
there
are no disputed material issues of fact and, therefore, no need for an
evidentiary trial-type hearing. n20

   n20 See Arkla Gathering Services Co., 67 FERC 61,257 (1994).VI. Request =
for
Rehearing

   On February 14, 1992, IESCO filed a request for rehearing of the=20
Commission's
January 15, 1992 order issuing Texas-Ohio a temporary certificate. IESCO
contends first that issuance of the temporary [*25]  certificate to Texas-O=
hio
was unlawful on three grounds: (1) the Commission acted beyond its statutor=
y
authority because it improperly determined that an emergency existed; (2) e=
ven
if an emergency existed, the Commission failed to make adequate findings
supported by substantial evidence; and (3) the Commission failed to resolve
jurisdictional and tariff issues in connection with issuance of the tempora=
ry
certificate.

   NGA section 7(c)(1)(B) provides that "the Commission may issue a tempora=
ry
certificate in cases of emergency, to assure maintenance of adequate servic=
e=20
or
to serve particular customers without notice or hearing, pending the
determination of an application for a [permanent] certificate . . . ." The=
=20
order
issuing a temporary certificate expressly found that an emergency exists=20
within
the meaning of section 7(c)(1)(B) of the Natural Gas Act and section 157.17=
 of
the Commission's regulations, and that the public convenience and necessity
required the issuance of a temporary certificate authorizing Texas-Ohio's
=0F,                                                                       =

operation of the Hunter Pipeline in order to continue service to existing
customers who had been relying on that service. n21 In support thereof, the
order referenced [*26]  the fact that: (1) Raritan River Steel Company, the
largest employer in Perth Amboy, New Jersey would be forced to purchase gas=
=20
at a
higher price and might have to close its plant with disastrous impacts on t=
he
community; and (2) a number of entities, including the Philadelphia Housing
Authority, the Dartmouth Finishing Corporation, and various schools indicat=
ed
that they are operating under strained budgets and that the inability to
transport gas on Texas-Ohio would result in severe fiscal restraints.

   n21 Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 58 FERC 61,025 at 61,059 (1992).

   Under these circumstances, we believe that an emergency situation was sh=
own
to exist within the standard established by NGA section 7 and that this
conclusion is appropriately supported by the evidence relied upon in the=20
order.
n22

   n22 See generally, Penn-York Energy Corp., 37 FERC 61,109 (1986);
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., 34 FERC 61,402 (1986).

   With regard to its assertion that the Commission failed to resolve certa=
in
jurisdictional and tariff issues prior to the issuance of the temporary
certificate, IESCO complains that:  [*27]  (i) the Commission issued a=20
temporary
certificate without making a finding that Texas-Ohio is a "natural gas=20
company"
subject to the Commission's NGA jurisdiction; (ii) the failure to resolve t=
he
jurisdictional issue leaves unresolved the question of whether a certificat=
e=20
of
public convenience and necessity is needed for the construction of the Hunt=
er
Pipeline; and (iii) the Commission has left unresolved the question of whet=
her
an open-season is required to assure non-discriminatory access to Texas-Ohi=
o's
facility, thus precluding shippers who were denied service from any=20
opportunity
to obtain service during the period that the temporary certificate is in=20
effect.

   IESCO's arguments misapprehend the function of a temporary certificate. =
By
its very nature, issuance of a temporary certificate precedes decisions on
matters related to issuance of the permanent certificate. The issues raised=
 by
IESCO are appropriate for decision in connection with the issuance of a
permanent certificate and we have addressed them above. n23

   n23 We in fact noted in the January 15, 1992 order that the issues raise=
d=20
by
IESCO relating to the jurisdictional status of Texas-Ohio and the provision=
 of
service on a nondiscriminatory basis would be resolved upon consideration o=
f=20
the
application for a permanent certificate. We stressed at that time that "the
grant of a temporary certificate is made to allow the resumption of service=
 by
specific customers previously utilizing Texas-Ohio's facilities to prevent
hardship." Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 58 FERC 61,025 at 61,060 (1992). [*28=
]

   IESCO also asserts that the Commission improperly refused to order an
evidentiary hearing before issuing the temporary certificate. IESCO alleges=
=20
that
efforts in Docket No. PR91-5-000 to determine the original and ultimate
destination of gas transported by Texas-Ohio were unsuccessful. It also sta=
tes
that the proceedings in Docket No. PR91-5-000 and the instant docket have b=
een
plagued by uncertainty over the identity of Texas- Ohio's customers and the
nature of the services rendered.

   We disagree that an evidentiary hearing was required prior to the issuan=
ce=20
of
=0F,                                                                       =

the temporary certificate. NGA section 7(c) does not require either notice =
or
hearings in conjunction with the issuance of a temporary certificate. Even=
=20
where
the statute requires an evidentiary, trial-type hearing, it is necessary on=
ly
where material issues of fact are in dispute that cannot be resolved on the
basis of the written record. n24 The matters raised by IESCO are speculativ=
e=20
or
immaterial to the decision to issue a temporary certificate to allow the
resumption of specific services to specific customers. Finally, IESCO alleg=
es
that the Commission failed to attach conditions needed to prevent abuse of =
the
temporary [*29]  certificate. IESCO states that the temporary certificate=
=20
should
have been expressly limited to serving customers previously served through =
the
Hunter Pipeline and that it should have included a condition for potential
refunds.

   n24 Arkla Gathering Service Co., 67 FERC 61,257 (1994).

   Our January 15, 1992 order specifically provided that the temporary
certificate is not a blanket authorization, but is limited to only those
customers with whom Texas-Ohio has existing transportation agreements. n25 =
The
order further specified that the grant of a temporary certificate is made t=

APPENDIX:

   APPENDIX

   Pro Forma Tariff Analysis: Specific Comments

1. Rate Schedules FTS and/or ITS

   Section 1 - Availability

In this section, Texas-Ohio reserves the right, in its sole judgement=20
(exercised
on a reasonable [*32]  and non-discriminatory basis) to decline service=20
whenever
it would be contrary to good operational practices or detrimental to other
customers. Texas- Ohio should revise this section to set out the specific
criteria or detrimental actions that would trigger this clause.

   Section 1.(iii) of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS requires shippers to provi=
de
Texas-Ohio with "acceptable" evidence of, among other things, gas supply,
market, and other transportation services. The term "acceptable" is vague a=
nd
subject to unduly discriminatory interpretation. Texas-Ohio must set forth
specifically the evidence required to be "acceptable".

   Section 2- Applicability and Character of Service

Section 2.4 of Rate Schedule ITS states that transportation will be "subjec=
t=20
to
curtailment or interruption as deemed necessary in Texas-Ohio's discretion.=
"=20
The
provision is vague and could result in unduly discriminatory application of
curtailment procedures. Texas-Ohio must modify the provision to detail the
specific operational characteristics and criteria used to determine the
conditions and need for curtailment.

   Section 3 - Priority and Interruption of Transportation Service

=0F,                                                                       =
 =20
PAGE 14
                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *33

Section 3.2 of Rate Schedule  [*33]  FTS provides for firm service on a fir=
st
come, first served basis. However, Texas-Ohio retains a priority for custom=
ers
with existing FTS agreements. This provision is unduly discriminatory and m=
ust
be removed from the tariff.

   Section 3.4 of Rate Schedule FTS provides that Texas-Ohio can curtail=20
service
due to reasons of force majeure "or any other operational considerations to=
 be
reasonably determined by Texas- Ohio". Texas-Ohio must set forth the specif=
ic
operational considerations it would rely upon in exercising this authority.

   In Section 3.5 of Rate Schedule FTS and Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule ITS=
,
Texas-Ohio proposes to suspend service if a shipper's account is unpaid for=
 30
days. Texas-Ohio can suspend service without prior Commission approval if a
customer fails to pay a billed amount within 30 days of the due date, but o=
nly
where 10 days notice is given and the shipper neither pays the bill nor=20
provides
guarantee of payment. Texas-Ohio must modify these provisions to provide fo=
r a
10 day notice period.

   Section 4 - Requests for Transportation

Section 4.1 of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS states that a shipper must comple=
te=20
a
FTS or ITS Request Form; however, no request  [*34]  form is included.
Texas-Ohio must establish a request form as part of its tariff. That form m=
ust
comply with the requirements of Order No. 497 as set forth in section=20
250.16(b)
of the Commission's regulations.

   Section 5 - Operating Conditions

Section 5.1 of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS requires shippers to provide
Texas-Ohio with estimates of gas to be transported and such other operating=
=20
data
as Texas-Ohio may require. This section should be amended to specify what=
=20
other
operating data may be required of shippers.

   Section 5.4 of Rate Schedules FTS and ITS specifies that Texas-Ohio will=
=20
not
provide service on any day for which all necessary upstream and downstream
arrangements cannot be confirmed. This clause should be amended to state th=
at
any action will be taken on a non-discriminatory basis.

   Section 6 - Rates

Section 6.2 of Rate Schedule FTS defines the monthly reservation and commod=
ity
(usage) charge. Texas-Ohio should insert the word "maximum" in the second
sentence prior to "monthly commodity charge" and "unit commodity rate(s)".

   Section 9 - Waivers

Section 9 of Rate Schedule FTS provides that Texas-Ohio may waive any right=
s
hereunder or any obligations of a customer on [*35]  a basis which is not=
=20
unduly
discriminatory.  This language creates the impression that Texas-Ohio retai=
ns
the discretion to waive default by the shipper of any provision in the tari=
ff.
This would give Texas-Ohio excessive latitude in operating under its tariff=
=20
and
provide an opportunity for undue discrimination among shippers. Waiver
provisions are permissible, but they must serve a functional purpose and=20
operate
under a specific and clearly defined set of circumstances. Texas-Ohio must
specify the criteria it will use in determining whether to waive a particul=
ar
=0F,                                                                       =

                 69 F.E.R.C. P61,145; 1994 FERC LEXIS 2340, *35

provision.

   2. General Terms and Conditions

Texas-Ohio's pro forma tariff contains no scheduling or imbalance penalties=
.
Pipelines are permitted, but not required, to impose penalties to maintain
control of their system. If scheduling or imbalances become a problem in th=
e
future, Texas- Ohio can make a tariff filing to propose appropriate penalti=
es.

   Section 2 - Transporter Receipt Point(s)

   Section 2.2 provides that Texas-Ohio's obligation to receive and deliver=
=20
gas
shall never exceed the total daily volume Shipper is able and willing to
receive. Texas-Ohio must remove the words "and willing" from this provision=
.=20
The
phrase [*36]  is vague and could lead to discriminatory activities.

   Section 5 - Nominations and Balancing Deliveries

Section 5.1 provides that a shipper will inform Texas-Ohio daily, "or on so=
me
other basis as Transporter may reasonably require pursuant to such other
procedures as may be established and published by Transporter from time to=
=20
time
. . . ." of the daily gas quantity. The phrase is vague and should be repla=
ced
with language specifying what other basis for notification is required (e.g=
.,
phone, fax, or telecopy).

   Section 5.2 requires shippers to give Texas-Ohio notice 24 hours in adva=
nce
"or as Transporter may designate from time to time" of any change in the da=
ily
quantity. Texas-Ohio should specify what alternative time frame would meet =
its
requirements or delete this phrase.

Please advise.

Marlene,  I am not sure what you are asking me to do.  If these contracts are 
active then they should be put into whatever is the proper contract tracking 
system for these types of services contracts (transport, pooling, etc.).  If 
they are not active and are of no value, then they probably should not be put 
into the database.  However, this is not a legal question, but a business 
question.  If the business decision is made that they are of no value and 
inactive, then they should be terminated in accordance with their terms. 

Let me know if I am missing the point of your question.  If I am not, then I 
will return these contracts to you.

Dan and Teresa,  Attached is the form of declaration of Managing Member under 
which Crescendo appoints ENA to exclusively negotiate a gathering deal with 
Wildhorse.  Please review.  




Teresa,  Do you think we need to get the Class B member approval also for 
this appointment of ENA as representative?  The LLC Agreement is open with 
respect to the Managing Member delegating its duties.

Dan or Ward,  Please note that the Crescendo LLC Agreement Section 6.3 
indicates that if the Managing Member request the Class C Member (Enron) to 
provide certain financial or technical services, then Class C Member may do

any commercial or engineering services it provides to the LLC such as 
negotiating with Wildhorse or Project Management of the Plant Construction?

Bill, 
I have revised the following to reflect what we discussed today. 

As an afterthought the only additional thing I would like to change is Item # 
1 to reflect minimum of twice or as deemed appropriate such as after a bad 
storm or when unauthorized "visitors" are reported at the site.


The following is a list of services for Texaco Pipelines LLC to monitor the 
leaching of
the new cavern:

A fixed fee of $1,800 per month, invoiced monthly, will provide
Enron with the following services:
1. Visual and physical inspection of the pump, wellhead, and associated
equipment (minimum twice in 24 hours or as deemed appropriate)
2. Pump pad oil as required
3. Backwash well twice a week
4. Communicate/coordinate with DOW on fresh water supply and brine
delivery
5. Routine maintenance and troubleshooting on well and associated
equipment (e.g. turbine meters, valve actuators, etc.)
6. Monitor sump area to avoid overflow
7. Write 3rd party work permits for any contract work being done on the
pump and well area
8. Start and stop fresh water booster pump as needed
9. Block in well in preparation for well logging
10. Obtain monthly electrical meter readings for Enron to verify direct
billing from Coastal Corp. to Enron.
11. Maintain files on well data
12. Forward Enron invoices to Enron in Houston.

For any maintenance activities, special projects, or other service requests
that extend beyond the 2 hours/day covered in the monthly fixed fee, Texaco
Pipelines LLC will invoice at $30/hour.  For contract services or materials
purchased by Texaco Pipelines LLC on behalf of Enron, Texaco will invoice
Enron at cost plus 15%.


I didn't find any wells in this file.  Looks like you inadvertantly attached 
the wrong file.

Dick Danes met some time ago with Exxon field personnel concerning this 
well.  They have now indicated that they have a good well and would like to 
be in service by August 15.  I have spoken with the Exxon commercial contact, 
Bill Nicus, and he indicated that they would like to site the meter station 
at the commonpoint and lay a 4" to HPL.  Dick is picking up a plat @Robstown 
office today that reflects where Exxon would like to tie into HPL.  Can we 
let Exxon install meter to our specs and pipeline and let us operate but they 
own?  We can tap our line and install riser for line to tie in.  I can get 
thruput commitment to pay out our investment in tap/riser.  I would prefer to 
let them bear costs and ownership with HPL doing measurement.   We will 
retain ownership of the tap/riser.  

Steve Vanhooser is out but has assigned this project to Gerald Nemec.  By

Confidential Work Material - Attorney Client Privilege


Attached for review is a draft of the letter to be sent to Wildhorse 
concerning the Gathering Agreement under which the Entrada and Dakota 
production is committed.  Please review and provide comments.

To summarize activities to date concerning this Gathering Agreement:

1.  Conducted a conference call with Brett Frie on Wednesday.  Brett also 
forwarded some correspondence between Enogex and Wildhorse.  The 
correspondence contained a summary of meeting minutes for two meetings 
conducted between Enogex and Wildhorse.  No demands were made by Enogex and 
no claims of unprofitability were made by Wildhorse.  Brett stated that the 
Entrada and to some extent the Dakota gas were shut in or curtailed because 
the downstream carriers starting enforcing their tighter gas specifications.  
Enogex took Wildhorse's word for that and never checked with Northwest or 
Questar.  I asked Brett why he thought Wildhorse would straight away release 
the gas.  He responded that he thought they would do so only if Crescendo 
negotiated an alternative arrangement with Wildhorse.  

2.  I received more correspondence on Friday from Ken Krisa.  Nothing really 
useful.  There was a letter from Wildhorse to another producer in the area 
called Lone Mountain Production Company which stated that Wildhorse thought 
these assets were in a state of economic viability decline.  Unfortunately 
this letter was not directed to Enogex.  However, the draft letter takes that 
position with Wildhorse.

3.  I am securing local consul out of Denver.  I want someone intimately 
familiar with Utah and Colorado law from a litigation and timing perspective 
to be involved.  We may need to seek a declaratory order.   We have run into 
to conflicts with law firm that have represented either KN or Tom Brown.  
Should have this resolved on Monday.

4.  Agreed to language on Friday with Ken Krisa and Jim Osborne and the 
declaration by Crescendo giving power to ENA to negotiate with Wildhorse.  

This draft does state our desire to pursue a release of the gas.  However, to 
reiterate, based on the current facts we do not have a black and white right 
to deem this gas as released under the Gathering Agreement.  The fact that 
the Entrada Gas is not in spec. with the downstream pipelines for inerts, 
allows Wildhorse to suspend their receipt of this gas without being in 
default. 



Joan,  The contract states that Wildhorse only has to accept gas from 
Crescendo that the downstream carriers will accept.  Per Brett Frie at 
Enogex, the Entrada production is 24% Nitrogen.  Until the plant is up and 
running, this gas will not meet any of the downstream carriers specs.  I am 
not sure how we get the Nitrogen out of the gas stream without the plant?  

The Dakota production was not mentioned in the letter, because I have no 
facts about the gas quality of this gas.  You had forwarded emails last week 
indicating the Dan Reineke was to take samples at the wellhead and downstream 
of Wildhorse's plant.  Once we have these facts we can send a letter 
concerning the Dakota.  Do you have any info on these samples?

		 Subject: Wildhorse Letter


Per the drafts, we are asking "Wildhorse to accept all gas delivered.... upon 
startup of the Treating Plant."   I thought the purpose of this letter was to 
get Wildhorse to take all of our gas right now, not just after the plant is 
started up.  Is this not so?   I agree with Dan, that  this letter only 
discusses the Entrada gas, with no mention of the Dakota curtailment, which I 
think it should.

I had just a couple minor changes...

Subject: Re: Wildhorse Letter  

Gerald --

I have provided a few coments (redlined) to your draft letter attached below.

However, I wanted to offer the following ideas for discussion with you and 
the others listed above as to potential inclusion in the Wildhorse letter:

 A.  Should we request written notification from Wildhorse related to the 
shut-in status of Entrada production?  Should we request written notification 
related to the recent curtailment of Dakota production?  [As we've discussed, 
Enogex never requested anything in writing from Wildhorse, so we do not have 
any historic documentation of Wildhorse's claims].

 B.  Should we identify (potential) contractual issues due to the curtailment 
of Dakota production; e.g.  Sec. 6 detailing the (wellhead) delivery pressure 
requirements under this contract, et al?  [As we've discussed, the system 
pressures have increased due to (initially) gas being re-routed by Wildhorse 
over the past two years which has loaded the San Arroyo system, and now the 
NWPL quality issues and subsequent Wildhorse curtailments has increased 
pressures system-wide.  If Wildhorse based their ability to allow these 
problems to persist by referring to Sec. 7 "Gas Quality" of the agreement, 
what remedies can we request....partial release of Dakota gas?].

Here's the frustration, based on conversations with producers in the area and 
the documents we've received from Enogex, Wildhorse has continued to attach 
non-pipeline quality spec gas to their system over the past couple years to 
increase gathering revenues, yet has not invested any $$$ for processing of 
this gas to meet or exceed the specs of downstream pipelines.  Then, they use 
the downstream pipes as the reason for shutting in all their captive 
producers, and have thus far offered no solutions to the system pressure and 
quality issues discussed above.  Therefore, its critical that this letter 
gets to the "right" people within Wildhorse and, if possible, make reference 
to some element of timing (e.g., reasonable dispatch, commercially reasonable 
manner, etc.). 


Thanks.

Dan

Dear U2 Fan,

We're in Dublin finishing the new album. It will be released at the end of
October.

In the meantime, keep your eye on the Green Room you may be the first to
hear music from the new album.

See you soon.

http://www.U2.com is powered by World Online http://www.worldonline.comAttached is the final version of the CSA.  Let me know if you need an 
executed hard copy.
Attached are the latest changes to the docs redlined against the originals 
docs, per your voicemail.

Chris,  I made one slight change from the versions I had sent to you 
earlier.  In the Capacity Allocation agreement signature block, I am now 
having ENA sign for section 4.5 as well. 

 Let me know if you need anything else.



Ken,  Attached is the letter.  Please sign and forward the original to Kent 
Harris via Fedex.  We should request a signature acceptance of the letter and 
a confirmation receipt of such signature acceptance for our files.

The letter has a header for Crescendo on it.  Not sure if you had stationary 
for Crescendo yet.

Send a signed copy to me  and I will copy all the Enron CCs.

Susan,  Attached are redlined copies of the CSA Amendments.  We made a change 
to the Monthly Contract Quantity to exclude Force Majeure events and Section 
2.4 Shaft energy interruptions.  Please review and call me with any 
questions.  x-33512.

Since we have circulated the prior amendment, I think it would avoid the most 
confusing by giving these amendments a new execution date.  I also added a 
section which specifices that these versions replace the amendments dated 
June 18, 1999.

The NBV letter values will also be redone.  The numbers will have to be 
changed.  The investors have asked that instead of a Contract Year Schedule, 
a quarterly schedule be included.   I don't have the numbers from Mark yet, 
but will forward those changes as soons as I get them.

Mark indicated that he had discussed these changes with both you and David.
Carol,  Attached is the revised letter.  Per the voicemail I left last week, 
please let me know if there are any issues with us stating the prepay in this 
letter.  Also when is TW expecting the payment to be wired.  Need that date.
FYI,  Attached is the final version of the letter that was sent to Wildhorse.

Gerald,

Attached is the revised letter that I am sending to Wildhorse.

Ken

    
 - Wildhorse 7-28-00.docAttached is the latest set of documents which have minor revisions based on 
my discussions with Chris last week.  These have been only redlined against 
the prior version, not the original versions.  Let me know if you want 
redlines against the original docs.  The LLC was not included as no changes 
were made from the versions already forwarded.

With respect to the cash out imbalance procedures. The Administrative 
Services Agreement (Exhibit B) currently has a rough procedure for such 
cashout.  It is also written such that the Members can adopt a new procedure 
at any time.  If the current procedures are not sufficient, it probably make 
the most sense to have only a working draft (approved by the members) of 
procedures in place until we have a few month of operations under our belt to 
work out the bugs.  Scott Sitter will be developing this draft.  The 
development of these procedures can be done outside these current revisions.  
A final imbalance procedure would be adopted by written action of the members 
upon development of those final procedures.

Let me know if you have any questions.

 I will be out the 17th and 18th.

Arvel,  I received your pressure data.  Unfortunately the contract pressure 
is assessed against the 3 year period prior to the Effective Date of the 
contract which is Oct. 19, 1993.  Any chance we would have any such data?  
Ken Krisa is also checking to see if he has any such data.  

Also, did we receive any quality information on Dakota production?  Thanks 
for your help.Ken,  Wanted to check and see if you guys were able to find any pressure data 
on Wildhorse for the period of 3 years prior to the Effective Date of the 
Gathering Agreement?  I think Jim was going to look and see if he had any 
such data.  Thanks.Attached is the letter.  I am forwarding per Mark's request.  Let me know if 
you have any comments.  If everything looks good, let me know and I will

Dan,  Our letter was definitely structured to encourage a quick solution.  As 
the situation stands now, Wildhorse's possible responses to the letter are as 
follows:

1.  Declare Unprofitability wrt to the gas covered by the amendment.
 If they do so, then they have the obligation to provide alternatives to 
Crescendo, one of which is release of the gas.  You are right, there is no 
time frame in the contract under which they must resolve these alternatives.  
That is a risk I pointed out early.  However, in our letter to Wildhorse, I 
proposed a time frame to resolve these issue of 2 weeks.  If Wildhorse is not 
working with us in good faith within a commercially reasonable time then we 
will have to make a choice:
  A.  Go for a Declaratory Judgment to have the gas released from the 
contract.  This will take time.  Depending on court docket loads, 6 months   
to 1 year.

  B.  Inform Wildhorse that we have been unable to reach an agreement within 
a commercially reasonable time and they have not negotiated in   good faith 
and we consider the gas released (contract breached by Wildhorse) and that we 
will build our own system.  Then Crescendo would   build its own system and 
risk a suit by Wildhorse. 

2.  Not declare Unprofitability
 If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, then they have the obligation 
under the contract to take the gas in accordance with its terms.  The only 
complication is that under the contract, Wildhorse's obligation to take the 
gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate 
gas stream.  Depending on Wildhorse's flow dynamics and our plant placement, 
Wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas.  After your 
field meeting and our engineering assessment, hopefully we will have a better 
understanding of that situation.  If Wildhorse does not declare 
unprofitability, we would demand evidence and assurances that they will be 
able to take the gas upon start up of the treating plant.

If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, but continues to discuss 
renegotiating of this deal, I would very directly ask them "under what 
provision of the contract do they believe they have the right to renegotiate 
any fees?".  They don't have a right to renegotiate under the contract 
without unprofitability.

Quick/HOU/ECT@ECT
		 Subject: Summary of Tom Brown Meeting

I wanted to provide a summary of my meeting with Tom Brown today.  I met with 
the Business Development Director, Bob Mustard. 

1)  Tom Brown (as 45% owner of Wildhorse) is pushing Kinder Morgan to come up 
with solutions to the production problems (quality, pressure, et al) 
currently being experienced in the Piceance Basin.

2)  Tom Brown is also encouraging KMI to develop plans to take Crescendo (and 
other producers) low Btu gas; they see these as a new business opportunity 
for Wildhorse.

3)  Tom Brown is focusing their drilling efforts in other regions of the 
Rockies, therefore TBI would be interested in discussing Entrada development 
ventures with Crescendo.  Bob worked at Amoco with Ken Krisa and is very 
familiar with the nitrogen treating technology.  (I passed all this info on 
to Ken/Jim).

4)  Here's the interesting part...Bob discussed (confidentially) that for the 
past 6-8 monthsTom Brown has been trying to negotiate a buy-out of Kinder 
Morgan's interest in Wildhorse (they have a right-to-match provision in their 
LLC agreement).  The snag is on the last increment of valuation which is now 
being negotiated by the very top mgmt (Kinder & Evans).  If they are 
successful, (which he thinks TBI will be), then TBI will turn-around and look 
to spin off the non-strategic systems (like the Piceance Basin assets) to 
third party purchasers.

This conversation with Tom Brown led me to a worst case scenario with regard 
to our negotiations with Wildhorse..............Wildhorse has been 
slow-playing negotiations since I first met with them in late May and #4 
above may be the reason why.  Now that we've sent the letter recently to 
Wildhorse requesting (essentially) to clarify their understanding / status of 
the contracts so we can get to work, my feeling (based on the transaction 
between KMI & TBI) is that Wildhorse may try to continue stalling until their 
transaction with TBI is complete, (how much longer will this take?).  Of 
course, if the transaction is completed, TBI has already made it clear they 
would like to sell this system, so even if ENA is interested, will TBI 
negotiate a gathering deal during this transition period or delay until the 
system is divested?

The point is this......I'm anticipating a generic, non-commital response to 
Crescendo's letter from Wildhorse.  Although I realize there are no time 
deadlines in the contract, could you suggest anything we can submit in 
writing to encourage a quick resolution to our contractual issues in the 
event my above worst case scenario begins to play itself out? 

I'm off to Grand Junction to meet with Wildhorse.  I'll keep you informed of 
any developments.

Thanks.

Dan
Chris,  The Amended Firm Gathering Agreements were executed back around July

Confidential Work Product - Attorney Client Privilege

Dan,  Our letter was definitely structured to encourage a quick solution.  As 
the situation stands now, Wildhorse's possible responses to the letter are as 
follows:

1.  Declare Unprofitability wrt to the gas covered by the amendment.
 If they do so, then they have the obligation to provide alternatives to 
Crescendo, one of which is release of the gas.  You are right, there is no 
time frame in the contract under which they must resolve these alternatives.  
That is a risk I pointed out early.  However, in our letter to Wildhorse, I 
proposed a time frame to resolve these issue of 2 weeks.  If Wildhorse is not 
working with us in good faith within a commercially reasonable time then we 
will have to make a choice:
  A.  Go for a Declaratory Judgment to have the gas released from the 
contract.  This will take time.  Depending on court docket loads, 6 months   
to 1 year.

  B.  Inform Wildhorse that we have been unable to reach an agreement within 
a commercially reasonable time and they have not negotiated in   good faith 
and we consider the gas released (contract breached by Wildhorse) and that we 
will build our own system.  Then Crescendo would   build its own system and 
risk a suit by Wildhorse. 

2.  Not declare Unprofitability
 If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, then they have the obligation 
under the contract to take the gas in accordance with its terms.  The only 
complication is that under the contract, Wildhorse's obligation to take the 
gas is subject to the downstream carriers ability to receive the aggregate 
gas stream.  Depending on Wildhorse's flow dynamics and our plant placement, 
Wildhorse could use this as reason to refuse delivery of our gas.  After your 
field meeting and our engineering assessment, hopefully we will have a better 
understanding of that situation.  If Wildhorse does not declare 
unprofitability, we would demand evidence and assurances that they will be 
able to take the gas upon start up of the treating plant.

If Wildhorse does not declare unprofitability, but continues to discuss 
renegotiating of this deal, I would very directly ask them "under what 
provision of the contract do they believe they have the right to renegotiate 
any fees?".  They don't have a right to renegotiate under the contract 
without unprofitability.

		 Subject: Summary of Tom Brown Meeting

I wanted to provide a summary of my meeting with Tom Brown today.  I met with 
the Business Development Director, Bob Mustard. 

1)  Tom Brown (as 45% owner of Wildhorse) is pushing Kinder Morgan to come up 
with solutions to the production problems (quality, pressure, et al) 
currently being experienced in the Piceance Basin.

2)  Tom Brown is also encouraging KMI to develop plans to take Crescendo (and 
other producers) low Btu gas; they see these as a new business opportunity 
for Wildhorse.

3)  Tom Brown is focusing their drilling efforts in other regions of the 
Rockies, therefore TBI would be interested in discussing Entrada development 
ventures with Crescendo.  Bob worked at Amoco with Ken Krisa and is very 
familiar with the nitrogen treating technology.  (I passed all this info on 
to Ken/Jim).

4)  Here's the interesting part...Bob discussed (confidentially) that for the 
past 6-8 monthsTom Brown has been trying to negotiate a buy-out of Kinder 
Morgan's interest in Wildhorse (they have a right-to-match provision in their 
LLC agreement).  The snag is on the last increment of valuation which is now 
being negotiated by the very top mgmt (Kinder & Evans).  If they are 
successful, (which he thinks TBI will be), then TBI will turn-around and look 
to spin off the non-strategic systems (like the Piceance Basin assets) to 
third party purchasers.

This conversation with Tom Brown led me to a worst case scenario with regard 
to our negotiations with Wildhorse..............Wildhorse has been 
slow-playing negotiations since I first met with them in late May and #4 
above may be the reason why.  Now that we've sent the letter recently to 
Wildhorse requesting (essentially) to clarify their understanding / status of 
the contracts so we can get to work, my feeling (based on the transaction 
between KMI & TBI) is that Wildhorse may try to continue stalling until their 
transaction with TBI is complete, (how much longer will this take?).  Of 
course, if the transaction is completed, TBI has already made it clear they 
would like to sell this system, so even if ENA is interested, will TBI 
negotiate a gathering deal during this transition period or delay until the 
system is divested?

The point is this......I'm anticipating a generic, non-commital response to 
Crescendo's letter from Wildhorse.  Although I realize there are no time 
deadlines in the contract, could you suggest anything we can submit in 
writing to encourage a quick resolution to our contractual issues in the 
event my above worst case scenario begins to play itself out? 

I'm off to Grand Junction to meet with Wildhorse.  I'll keep you informed of 
any developments.

Thanks.

Dan

		 Subject: EOL transport intent and suggested EOL language


Gerald, here are some things to think about before our meeting.  EDG



HPL's intent for initiating EOL service:

Sell interruptible transport in stated volume increments
Develop daily, weekly and monthly markets in transport that parallel the 
Texas desk business (price the transportation service required to supply a 
peaking deal or a week day only deal.)


Proposed EOL language by Steve Hotte with Northern's IT group. He is the lead 
on this project from an EOL perspective

A transaction under which the specified Enron natural gas pipeline will 
transport, on an interruptible basis, a maximum daily volume (stated in MMBtu 
per day) equal to the volume identified on the website.  The gas will be 
transported from the specified receipt point(s) to the specified delivery 
point(s).  The bid and offer rates are stated as one-part rates in $(US) per 
MMBtu.  If a transaction is consummated, the shipper will be billed the 
one-part rate, which is inclusive of all applicable surcharges, based on 
usage.  In addition, the shipper will be billed the applicable charge for 
fuel.  The term of the transaction will correspond to the dates shown on the 
website.


Additional considerations for HPL's participation, EOL language and GTC (?) 
language.

HPL needs a two part rate, the first part to be billed regardless of use (a 
demand charge).   Colleen suggested a very small charge ($.0025/MMBtu) to 
keep counterparties from buying capacity and leaving us high and dry.  The 
second part is the total rate less the demand charge that will be billed on a 
commodity basis.  The rate billed will never be larger than the rate 
transacted on EOL.

HPL will not have a bid at this time.  Theoretically, HPL owns all the 
interruptible transportation capacity and it would be purchasing capcity from 
itself.  In short, HPL will not be showing bids.

Points will really be market zones with well defined pipeline points within 
them.  Bouncing between points (as capacity at each point allows) will be 
permitted as long as the shipper continues to utilize the path purchased.

The transaction is good for the time purchased, if there is a break in the 
shipper's use during the transaction, the capcity must be renegotiated, in 
any event the demand charge will be billed for the full term of the 
transaction.----- Forwarded by Gerald Nemec/HOU/ECT on 08/09/2000 09:13 AM -----

		 Subject: Update on Gabrielle Grace


There have been many inquiries about Gabrielle, so I thought I would give 
everybody an update.  Unfortunately, the prognosis is not good.  She has had 
many complications since the surgery (chest fluid, blood clots, infections, 
and fluctuating blood pressure due to high blood acidity).  For the past 24 
hours, she has been relatively stable, but no improvements.  She is still in 
ICU and it could still go either way.  

When Jim's 2 1/2 year old son, Connor, visited Gabrielle on Monday, he looked 
at Jim and said "Gabrielle wants to go home."  Please keep her in your 
prayers.  

Thank you,
Dina

Trevor,  Please review the spreadsheet and let me know if you agree.  The

letter agreements
Attached is a rough draft of the agreement we discussed last week.  Please 
review and let's discuss.

		 Subject: Revised

Gerald,

I received your voice-mail regarding the LOU.  

Paul Miller requested that I add some definition to the term "I-80 
corridor".  The following is my language for that.  

"(ii) any gas transportation pipeline or transmission system in the I-80 
corridor, which corridor is defined as being three (3) miles wide on each 
side of I-80,"

Paul also left me a garbled voice mail regarding another point related to the 
Participation Rights section.  I haven't been able to reach him to get 
clarification on that.  I don't know whether this will turn out to be a 
revision or not at this time.

As you mentioned there may be revisions required in the "Employee Matters" 
section to comport with the offer of employment that will actually take place.







I am sending hard copies.  I can't find the electronic version.

Creek, and
  (ii) the Guaranty, dated as of 12/17/98 by BR in favor of Lost Creek
so that I can prepare the Guaranty Terminations to be executed in connection 
with the conversion.  Thanks.

Please call me at (713) 220-4427 if you have any questions.

Mark,  Please review and lets discuss.
How is it going?  Haven't talked to you in awhile.  It has been pretty busy 
around here.  Trying to sell all these nasty assets.  I am leaving for your 
homeland, Denver to experience the Rocky Mountain high for myself.  Just what 
the hell was John Denver singing about anyway?  Let me know what's going on.  Hi Emmye,  Sorry I haven't gotten back with you sooner.  It has been 
extremely busy here at work and I am leaving for Denver today at 5:30 so I am 
really having to hustle to get things done before I leave.  How was the 
wedding?  I know you really were just looking for any excuse to go to Tomball.

I too had fun on Thursday.  I will give you a call when I get back from 
Denver. I will be back on Sunday.  Take care and talk to you soon.

Gerald  Mark,  Attached are the latest revisions to the participation language.  
Please review and if everything looks acceptable, forward to NBP.
Nick,  Do you have an electronic version you could send me?Chris,  Attached is the revised Work Offer.  Please forward to Hanover for 
execution.
Made a few slight changes to correct company's name.
Susan,  Attached are the letter agreements between ECS and TW which cover the 
earlier letters I sent.
Since Eric is a contract employee, he was not included as part of the formal 
PRC process recently completed.  Therefore we would like to receive feedback 
from you concerning Eric's performance outside the performance management 
system.  I will be forwarding a hard copy Performance Evaluation form for 
your input.  You may either hand write or email the information back to me.  
Whichever is easier for you.  Please take time out of your busy schedules to 
complete the forms as soon as possible.  I would like to have a response by 
Aug. 24th.  Thank you for your time.Jessica,  Attached are the Agreement for both Suzanne and Diane.  The form 
also refers to a Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreement that both 
Suzanne and Diane must execute.  I have a call in to Michelle about those 
forms.  I will forward as soon as I get them.  We can go ahead though and 
forward these agreements to MTM.
Attached for your review is a draft of the Lost Creek - ENA IT Agreement.  
Please review and let me know if you have any comments or questions.  Some 
provision (nominations, imbalances)  are taken from the North Central 
Agreement since BR is familiar with that form.
Eric, Need your help on this.  Let's get a copy of the grazing lease that 
Candy is referring to in the E-mail.  I am not clear on what she means by 
having Merl operate the well.  I think she means allow him to graze this area 
under the terms of his existing lease, but I am not sure.  Can you get with 
Candy on this?  Thanks.

		 Subject: Water Well @ Bammel

Nathan tells me that he has a request in to you for a dollar evaluation of 
the Hamill Gas Unit #1 water well that EOG recently assigned and conveyed 
over to HPL at my request.  Please advise me at your earliest convenience 
what that value may be so that we can appropriately get it on our asset 
ledger.  I am also awaiting a response from John Towles as to a clearer plat 
on this property as was originally requested by EOG some time ago which I 
assume we will use as an exhibit to the Operating Agreement..

Also, by copy hereof, I ask that Gerald or his designee prepare an Operating 
Agreement between HPL and Merl Vanek whereby Merl will be entitled to operate 
this well for purposes of his grazing lease at this facility.  HPL desires 
that Merl operate this well at his sole cost and expense and maintain it in 
good working order.  We can make the term of this Operating Agreement 
coterminous with his grazing lease which is established under an October 1, 
1998 Grazing Lease with an original term of one year from that date and 
year-to-year thereafter unless sooner terminated by at least 90 days' advance 
written notice prior to the end of the original term or any renewal term 
thereafter by one party to the other.  Merl's address is 2634 Milroy Lane, 
Houston, TX  77088 with a phone number of 281-444-8689 and a fax number of 
281-587-4200.  I have already advised Merl of the effective ownership of this 
well by HPL and he will be operating it accordingly as his need to do so is 
urgent, so I request that this document be prepared as soon as possible in 
consideration of HPL's liability.

Thanks to all for your help on this.Jessica,  Attached are the Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreements.  
There is one for Suzanne Badeaux, Diane Allen, and MTM Temps.   Let me know 
if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Under the terms of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement, ECS is working 
with the electric utility (Tri-State) to provide TW access to Tri-State's web

Tri-State's system peaks.  Attached is a confidentiality agreement which 
Tri-State drafted under which Tri-State will allow both TW and ECC to see 
such data.  Tri-State is obviously concerned with migration of the data to 
Enron's power trading groups.  The attached draft includes my comments.  I

what I have is already hard to read.

Hope you had a safe journey back from the land of Cabo.  We made it back 
without a problem.  I am really getting hammered at work today.  Reality 
baby!  Apparently my clients just can't do without me. 

What did you guys do on your last night?  Let me guess. El Squid Roe.  Did 
your partners meet any new family members?

I really had a great time hanging out with you.  It made my trip that much 
more memorable to be with a special person like you.  Drop me a note when you 
get a chance and let me know how you are.

Take care,
Gerald.  Susan,  Tri-States comments.  I plan to give them Colorado law but to discuss 
the other two with them.  Let me know your thoughts.

		 Subject: Confidentiality Agreement


Gerald:

Jere Bates asked that I comment on your redline of the confidentiality
agreement that I helped draft.  My comments are as follows:

1. Regarding the strikeout in Section 2 of the language concerning the
obligations of Enron surviving termination, Tri-State is opposed to striking
this.  The information is not to be used at any time other than for the
purpose set forth in the agreement, and the fact that Enron may cease to
acquire new information should not relieve it of its obligation not to use
information it has previously received for unintended purposes. We believe
that language protects against that occurrence-and is consistent with the
language in the last sentence of Section 5 as well.

2. Regarding Section 6, Tri-State is opposed to waiving consequential,
punitive or exemplary damages because in our view, it is likely that many
damages Tri-State would suffer as a result of a breach would not be direct
or ordinary, but rather consequential.  In addition, the right to recover
punitive or exemplary damages is needed in our view to protect against
blatant disregard for the terms of the agreement.  We also believe that we
should have three years to commence an action after termination.

3.  Regarding Section 7(b), we believe Colorado law is appropriate since
Tri-State is the party that would be bringing an action for breach and
should have the benefit of doing so in accordance with the laws it is
familiar with.

Please feel free to call or e-mail me or Jere with a response.  We are open
to discussing these points, but do feel very strongly that our position is
reasonable and appropriate.

Thanks,

Dave Nocera  In Section 7 Indemnity in the first sentence, after the words "causes of 
action" I added suits, awards, liabilities, fines, costs, fees, expenses.  
This was missed earlier.

GT,  Man you are killing me with that story of the naked blonde.  I almost 
cried for not going now.  Is she still married, because if not I want to 
propose.  

Cabo was pretty sweet.  Plenty of sun, sand, and women.  Hooked up with a 
chick from Seattle for most of the week and had a great time.  We went 
fishing one day and caught a 100 lb. swordfish.  Took a portion of it to a 
restaurant and they cooked it for us.  Awesome.  There were tons of Honeymoon 
couples down there.  You might want to check it out.  It is a short flight 
and pretty reasonably priced.  They have some great hotels as well.

I will be coming in for the Houston game weekend after next, so have my room 
ready.  Talk at ya later.

G  Need  your help with an agency agreement per this email.  Let's talk about 
this one.

		 Subject: Crescendo San Arroyo Dakota Noms into NWPL


I've been needing to set up Crescendo/ENA into Wildhorse's system, so that 
ENA can nom the gas starting October 1st.  Part of what I need to do is set 
up an agency agreement with contact names stating that ENA will be making the 
noms on behalf of Crescendo under transport contract xx, and yy.  The 
transport contracts I have are to Questar [current Enogex transport 
contracts].  I called Becky Shulz [Wildhorse] to talk again about what all I 
need to do, and ["playing dumb"] was asking her what the NWPL contract # was 
that I needed to set up in my paperwork.  She said she would have to look at 
the map to see exactly where our wells were...to find which interconnect was 
best, but before she did that, she needed to discuss this with Kent, but more 
so to make sure that he has all the paperwork he needs, re NG assigning this 
contract to us.  Kent will be out of the office until Friday.

Noms are due in about 1.5 weeks.

Attached is the form of CA to be used for your Kern River discussion.  I can 
print executables if you need.  Let me know.
That's a good one.  This is taking on much more meaning now that she possibly 
might be a US Senator.  Yikes.

               OVER THE HILLARY
                            * * *
submitted by The Captain

Hillary Clinton and her driver were cruising along a country road one
evening
when a cow ran in front of the car.

The driver tried to avoid it but couldn't - the cow was killed.

Hillary told her driver to go up to the farmhouse and explain to the owners
what happened.

About an hour later, the driver staggered back to the car with his clothes
in
disarray.  He was holding a bottle of wine in one hand, a cigar in the other

and smiling happily.

"What happened?" asked Hillary.

"Well," the driver replied, "the farmer gave me the wine, his wife gave me
the
cigar, and their beautiful daughter made mad passionate love to me."

"My God, what did you tell them?" asked Hillary.

The driver replied: "I'm Hillary Clinton's driver, and I just killed the
cow."

Thanks for the offer.  I just have too much going on here to make it.  See ya.

Attached for review is a redline of the latest revisions to Schedules to the 
Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Also attached are various supplements to the 
schedules.  The only items not included are the Capital Account Balances - 
Schedule 3.1(g) and the Financial Statements - Schedule 3.1(i).  Karry 
Kendall will be forwarding those shortly this evening.  



Also attached is Exhibit A-2.  This is an item description of the equipment 
included in the EMS gathering systems.  I also forwarded Exhibit D - 
Specified Geographical Area and Exhibit A-1 - Map of the EMS Gathering System 
earlier today via FEDEX.  You should have those tomorrow morning.
Hi Dee Dee

OK, It is at about this point in time when my thoughts turn to my next 
vacation.  Jeez, criminy (little Seattle lingo) have I been busy this week.  
Looking forward to the weekend to chill out a little.  No big plans but to 
enjoy the college football extravaganza on Saturday.  Maybe grill some beast 
depending on the weather and partake of a few sodas.  It has been raining 
here all week which is good, because at least it isn't 107 degrees out.  

My clients in Denver wanted a full download on all my Cabo activities.  These 
are the guys who have been to Cabo several times including the 20/20 club.  
As a matter of fact, the project I am working on right now for these guys is 
called Project 20/20.  Coincidence, I don't think so.  Anyway, when I told 
them I met this girl who went to 20/20 with me, they were very impressed.  
They now hold me in higher esteem than before.  At least that's one way to 
gain the respect of your clients.

So how is the great Northwest? Have your told grandparents about the 
wonderful time you had in Cabo with some strange guy walking around in your 
shoes.  Some details are probably better left out.    

I am about out of here.  Take care and I will talk to you later.

GeraldAttached is the revised agreement with Utah added.  Let me know if you need 
anything else.
Attached is a redlined version of the schedules with changes for the 
sales/use taxes on EMS materials.  All other supplements to the schedules 
remain unchanged.

Eva,  All the references are conditional upon term conversion occurring prior 
to closing, so they work even though Term Conversion won't occur prior to 
closing.  We plan on leaving the references as they exist.  Let me know if 
you have any questions.

Jere,  I have reviewed the draft and everything looks fine except for the $10

Attached is a redlined copy of the revised schedules incorporating the 
comments sent by NBP this weekend and also reflecting the executed Lost Creek 
amendments.  Please review.  
Attached is a redlined copy of the revised schedules to the Purchase and Sale 
Agreements.  Also attached, for the sake of completeness, are the supplements 
to the schedules.  The supplements are the same as prior versions, except for 
some changes to the title defects schedules for the Maverick, Box Draw, and 
Caballo systems.  

I attempted to redline the schedules for the title defects, but it redlined 
the whole list.  The only change of substance added was a new Wyoming DOT 
road crossing permit to Maverick.  Also taken off were references to the 
documents that have been prepared and sent to Gillette (that information was 
contained in brackets and began "[See Attached ....].  That information was 
for the right of way agents in Gillette so that they knew what documents had 
been prepared for them.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
Attached are clean versions of the 20/20 Schedules
I might have fallen asleep before in church, but fortunately have never 
turned myself into a human candle.  I did spend several years as an altar 
boy.  We got to wear those cool outfits also.  

How are you doing?  Thanks for not rubbing in the loss from Saturday.  This 
is a time of healing right now for me, so be gentle.

This is incredible.  The kid was a life long Aggie Fan, makes one trip to 
Austin and commits to UT.  I think we have finally found the guy to win it 
all for us (MB).   Also now Chance is saying he will actively recruit for 
us.  He wants this years class to be better than last years class.  I think a 
few phone calls to Roy Williams and BJ Johnson.  I can't wait til August.  

When are you coming back guy.  Are you ready for some football?

G$,

How goes it?  So how about Mack Brown?  He still amazes me with recruiting 
prowess.  Under Mackovic, getting Mock would have been an accident, but I am 
beginning to expect these recruits to start coming to Texas now.  Help me 
keep my expectations low!

Hi Kelly,    Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner, but have been 
swamped.  I am thinking the South Carolina game works.  However, what does a 
flight to Florida cost?  I need to factor that in as well, as I am planning 
on going to Spain in November and probably need to watch my $$$.    

I have been to several OU games in Dallas, and it is actually more fun than 
the A&M game because they split the stadium 50/50 Texas OU.  It is pretty 
intense.  I am trying to get tickets to the game this year and will probably 
go.

Okay, here's the rest of the Gators' home schedule and the Longhorns' schedule
for comparison.

          Gators              Longhorns
Oct 7          LSU            Oklahoma in Dallas
Oct 14         Auburn              at Colorado
Nov 11         South Carolina      at Kansas

Do you go to the game Oklahoma game in Dallas?  I went one year and it was a 
lot
of fun.

So, if you have any desire to do this swap, let me know.



I will check with my bro, to see if he is interested and let you know.  Get 
some sleep.   Talk at ya later.

well.  If you are still out there drop me a line!Hi Mom,   Sorry I haven't gotten back with you sooner.  I have just been 
pretty busy at work and on the weekends.  Seems like there is not enough

Gerald:

Generally, I agree with the comments in your memo.  As it emphasizes, the
factors that will ultimately shape this dispute and its outcome are the
facts.  What we really need now is to get a better handle on what effects
moving the Entrada/Dakota production to Badger Wash will have on Wildhorse,
and what Wildhorse  will say in response to Crescendo's proposal.

include the assignment of capacity, which lead to a re-evaluation of the 
credit reserve.  It is imperative now, that once the contract and 
transactions are executed, they be re-confirmed in TAGG to more accurately 
reflect the exposure of JM

A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And
when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back
that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole,
because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps
improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the
same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as slowest brain
cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, we all know, kills brain cells, but
naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way,
regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cell making the
brain a faster and more efficient machine.

And that's why you always feel smarter after a few beers.

Hi Katie,    Sorry it has taken awhile to respond.  I have been out of town 
for awhile.  

Good to hear from you again.  I understand about the summer.  Sometimes we 
get so busy and it seems like weeks go by without noticing.  

I had a good summer.  My little sister got married up in Estes Park, Colorado 
in August.  Estes is a neat little town near Rocky Mountain National Park.  I 
spent four days up there.  My whole family made the trip, so that was cool.  
The weather up there is awesome.  I played around of golf and I don't think 
it ever got above about 75 degrees.  They had the reception at the Stanley 
Hotel.  This hotel was where Stephen King was staying when he got the 
inspiration to write the Shining.  No weird events occurred at the reception 
though.  

I also just got back about 2 weeks ago from Cabo San Lucas.  I spent 8 days 
down there with some friends.  Scuba diving, fishing, beach, drinking, and 
dancing.  Not necessarily in that order though.  I was a little worried about 
being down there for that long, but it was great once I got used to partying 
till 4 am and sleeping til noon.  

Enron is going well.  We just closed another big deal last week, so the 
pressure is off for now again.  There will surely be another next quarter.  
Can't wait .

I feel for you concerning statistics.  Actually that was one of the courses 
that gave me the most problems in engineering school.  I must admit I 
probably didn't try as hard as I should have.  I just hated the course so 
much that I just wanted to get it over with.  Hang in there.   You will get 
through it.  Is this your last semester?  If I remember correctly, I thought 
you were going to graduate in December.  

It is really good to hear from you again.  Take care and drop me a note when 
you get a chance.

Gerald

Hi Dee,

I am really sorry to hear about your brother's child.  I hope everything with 
you and your family is as well as it can be right now.  I will say a prayer 
for yall.

I am doing good.  Staying busy with work as you suggested.  Actually we 
closed our big deal last Thursday.  That will allow my hours to become 
somewhat more normal in the near future.  They are planning a trip to reward 
those who worked so hard on this deal.  Guess where? Cabo.

Went to Austin this past weekend to watch my beloved Longhorns play.  They 
won, fortunately.  It was good to see some old friends and hang out.   I 
wouldn't mind moving back to Austin, but the jobs there just don't pay as 
much as in Houston.  Everyone wants to stay in Austin after school, so they 
can lowball you on the cash.

Looking forward to the pictures.  Need to refresh my memory of Cabo.  Take 
care and talk to you later.

Hi Gerald,

I am still here!  Sorry for not getting back to you sooner.....  My brother's 
baby passed away from SID's the week I got back from Cabo and so we have been 
dealing with the funeral and all of the emotions that go with losing 
someone.  I think the whole ordeal is harder when it is a baby.... So 
needless to say I have been out of the office way too much and I am so very 
much behind!

Good news!  I have some pictures that I will be sending to you next week!  
That way you will not be able to forget what I look like.... I keep 
forgetting them in my truck but I will make it a priority to send them to you 
by Tues.

How is everything going for you?  Keeping busy with work and hopefully your 
social life?  I think that you are the type that works way too many hours!!   
I am sure that one day you will balance everything out...

Well it has been a full day ( I know it is only 3:00... ) and it is also 
Friday so I am going to call it good and go home, take a nap and get up in a 
couple of hours and head down to Seattle with Julie and Angie...

Have a great weekend and I will talk to you Tuesday!

Take Care,

Dee

Are you still out there?  Sent you an email last week but didn't hear from
you.  Just checking to see if you are still in Seattle or if you moved down
to Cabo for good.


A redlined version with my changes.  Let me know if you have any questions.
Barbara,  I put hard copies of these documents in your chair.

The pictures were very amusing.  Thanks for sending those along.  Looks like 
you guys hung out quite a bit with the neighbors.  I especially like the 
candid shot of me in my Tommy Hilfiger's.  Whoa, got to start working out and 
shed the love handles.  I thought there would be more shots of Squid Roe 
since that is where you guys hung out most of the time.

Looks like your Mariners made the playoffs.  I really don't follow Texas but 
I do follow the Astros.  I think everybody is just happy the season is over 
with so we can forget it as quickly as possible.  The Astros were pretty 
horrible this year.

Hope you are doing well.  Did you keep Julie and Angie out of trouble this 
weekend?  I know that is probably impossible.  Thanks for the pics again and 
I'll talk to you later.  

Gerald   I would call Kent and ask about this.  I would also remind him about our 
request for the pressure data in the September 14 letter and their 
obligations to keep pressures at the average pressure for the 3 year period 
prior to the effect date of the agreement.  

Mark,  We also need you to keep notes, with dates and times, of all your 
discussions and communications with Wildhorse.  Dan, Has been preparing his 
notes and you may want to just add onto his notes.  

Dan,  I also need to get a copy of your notes when you get a chance.

Gentlemen,

Please see the attached production report - note the comment under
"DOWNTIME" at the end of the report.  It indicates Wildhorse pulled out a
compressor last week at the San Arroyo Plant and our pressures have
increased.   We are trying to get more information and will pass it along
when we get it.

		 Subject: Crescendo Noms into NWPL

I spoke with Kent Harris at Wildhorse today and he stated there position to 
me on a few things.

1.  Our Interruptible noms to NWPL for Wed. were not cut due to contractual 
reasons, we were cut due to a lack of capacity.  He said that the San Arroyo 
#2 compressor was down and without it they cannot make additional deliveries 
to NWPL.  They hope to have it up by friday and will try to provide us some 
capacity into NWPL.

2.  Kent reiterated their position regarding our contract by stating that 
"the intent of the original contract was not to take gas through other 
systems other than the Mesa system".  In addition he stated that we do not 
have the right to choose which pipeline our gas is delivered to.

3.  He also asked whether or not we were willing to negotiate on the current 
situation or if we wanted to let the 'lawyers fight it out".  I reiterated 
that we have been waiting for them to either acknowledge that they will 
gather the entrada gas under the current contract or provide us with another 
alternative.  Absent either of those 2 things happening all we can do is try 
to live by the existing agreement.  He stated that they have new estimates on 
the cost to construct a new line through the South Canyon and it is 
approximately $1MM less than their original esitmate.

We left it that he would determine whether or not they would gather  the 
Entrada under the existing contract or make a new proposal that would most 
likely wrap the Entrada and Dakota up under one new deal and replace the 
existing contract.

I told him we would determine whether or not we wanted to "let the lawyers 
fight over the existing contract" or work on a new deal for all the 
production.

P.S.  They are still very interested in some type of Joint Venture.

Liz Orr with Wildhorse just called to inform me we cannot nominate into 
NWPL.   Her legal department has informed her there are issues with the 
contract and until they inform her otherwise, our gas can only flow into 
Questar.   Physically, we can flow into NWPL but contractully we cannot.

We have changed the nominations back to Questar for tomorrow's gas day.

Sorry about that, (we tried)

Davis,  This actually sounds frighteningly like my experience at the Big 12

		 Subject: Tom Brown Discussions regarding Wildhorse

Bob Mustard from Tom Brown called me at 5:00 today to inquire as to my 
understanding of the Wildhorse/Crescendo issues.  I explained to him the 
situation in a nutshell and he told me that they thought they would have 
completed the acquisition this week but should be finished next week.  He 
asked if we were still interested in acquiring the Mesa system and I told him 
that I thought we were interested in the gathering system and potentially 
theTom Brown  reserves.  He said they are very interested in talking to us 
about a deal on these properties and will forward a Confidentiality Agreement 
to me tomorrow.  

He also mentioned that there is a conference call tommorow at 11:00 A.M. 
central time between Crescendo and Wildhorse.  Wildhorse has asked that Tom 
Dyk and Pete Schere (Tom Brown execs) participate in that conference call.  
Tom and Pete are not comfortable participating in that call given the 
situation at hand.  Therefore, he asked if we could have Ken Krisa or someone 
else postpone the meeting.

Let's Discuss at your earliest possible convenience.

Mark Attached is a form agreement for the Oakhill Transaction.  Please note the 
italicized sections of the CSA.  I am not sure what the terms quoted to 
Oakhill have been with respect to interruptions in service and adjustments to 
energy pricing.  We may want to leave these sections blanks for now.  Please 
review and let me know if you have any questions.
Not sure if you or someone in your group already had seen this.

This awesome picture was taken in Bitteroot National Forest in Montana on

from Fairbanks, Alaska.  He took the picture with a digital camera.  Because
he was working at the time he took the picture he cannot profit from it;
however, we feel the picture is a once-in-a-lifetime shot and should be

Horoscopes 
? 














By Lloyd Schumner Sr.
Retired Machinist and A.A.P.B.-Certified Astrologer 

? 
? 

Aries: (March 21--April 19) 
After enduring the false smiles and empty promises of the business world for 
22 years, you'll appreciate the candor of the DEA agents assigned to you. 

Taurus: (April. 20--May 20) 
It seems like another sleepy day around your house. Unless, of course, you 
live at 332 Pheasant Drive in Yuma, AZ. 

Gemini: (May 21--June 21) 
You've lost your enthusiasm, but you're unsure if it was "damped" or 
"dampened." 

Cancer: (June 22--July 22) 
Cancer would like to take this opportunity to point out that it was right 
about the unrest in Yugoslavia. 

Leo: (July 23--Aug. 22) 
Though you've been telling everyone that you "went down on a boatload of 
sailors," the aircraft carrier Nimitz is actually a "ship."

Virgo: (Aug. 23--Sept. 22) 
You will make religious and scientific history when you develop a machine 
that converts standard English measurements to Islam.
? 
Libra: (Sept. 23--Oct. 23) 
While it's true that life is not a movie, many of your problems will be 
solved when the Army destroys the giant lizard 10 minutes before the end. 

Scorpio: (Oct. 24--Nov. 21) 
Things have certainly changed for you during these last few years. For one 
thing, eating a complete breakfast is now more important than ever. 

Sagittarius: (Nov. 22--Dec. 21) 
You will be hailed as a Catholic genius when you invent a new rhythm that's 
45 percent effective in preventing non-predestined pregnancies. 

Capricorn: (Dec. 22--Jan. 19) 
You will be one step closer to perfection when famed Italian engineer Massimo 
Bordi redesigns you for better airflow and optimal fuel atomization. 

Aquarius: (Jan. 20--Feb. 18) 
Wednesday will provide those who know you a perfect opportunity to marvel 
about how right Dante was about the fate of moneylenders. 

Pisces: (Feb. 19--March 20) 
The stars indicate success for you, but they do so with enough ambiguity to 
cover any possible alternatives.

Did you take the LSAT and kick its butt already?  I thought you were 
scheduled to take that recently.  You are probably wishing you have more 
stuff to study on the weekends.   I am forwarding these to you with the condition that you are not allowed to 
send these to any of your uppity OU cronies.

How dare you take such a tone with my counsellor.  You're just bitter that 
you have squandered all rights to your furniture.  Face it, your furniture 
likes me better anyway now.

Hendon,

I don't know what to say.  You sounded so official with that email.  How long 
did it take you to write it?

I'd like to make an announcement.  Hendon has become funny in my absence.  
Funny ha-ha.

I hope you got a good deal on my wine table.

I've always thought of you more as a turkey - never an eagle.  Whatever
floats your boat though.  Just remember you're anything and everything in
the confines of your own mind  : )

Thanks for the address - I bought your wine table from Gerald (who had
squatters right on it and could legally sell it to me - he's an attorney,
remember) .  The rest of your furniture belongs to Gerald - Texas Statue
013 from the year 1883 - "he that goes to the land of them Yankees forsakes
all possessions, belongings and all things Texan.  Carpetbaggers and
Yankees have no claim on any property in the Republic of Texas."

Sorry - wish I could help you out - but the law is the law.  Have fun at
the game.

Brian

GT,  How is it going?  Man, was that an ass-whipping or what that we took 
from OU.  Looks like we salvaged some dignity with the CU game.  

I was planning on coming in for the Missouri game.  I might have my brother 
and another friend with me.  How are you set for space.  Those guys could 
crash on the couches, if its not a problem with you.  If it is a problem, 
just let me know and we can make other arrangements.  

Talk at ya later

GHi Katie,  You guys would love Cozumel.  Short flight, very cheap, and lots 
of fun.  If any of you Scuba Dive, Cozumel has some of the best diving in the 
world.  I had a blast down there.

Hope your Stats. class is going OK.  Unfortunately, I think that is one of 
those classes the just requires more effort than most classes. 

Work hasn't been too busy for me lately.  However, I know that will change as 
we get closer to the end of the year.  I do have a trip to Spain planned for 
November.  Some friends and I will be going over the Thanksgiving week.  We 
are flying into Madrid and will also go to Lisbon, Portugal.  Other than that 
we will work our way around the coast on the South of Spain.  I am really 
looking forward to it.  

Hope everything else is going well for you.  Are you sure you don't want to 
go for your Phd once you graduate.      : -)Was curious if you heard anything further on this?  I haven't called again.  
Debating whether I should.

Any plans to go up to Estes anytime soon?

What's up rude-dog.  Haven't heard any new recruiting news.  I think it is 
going to be quiet on that front until later in the football season.  

I was up in Denver this past week and talked to Jessica Wentworth.  She said 
you have been exploring the Australian countryside.  Bet there is some 
amazing stuff down under.  Anyway, drop me a note and let me know how its 
going.

I know I have asked this before, but when are you getting into town?  We need 
to have some repatriation beers upon your arrival.  Attached is the form for assignment of the CIG and Trailblazer PA.  Please 
review and let me know if you have any questions.  If everything looks OK, 
these are ready to forward to CIG, Trailblazer, and Huber for execution.
GT,  Right now it will only be me and maybe my brother.  Probably stay both 
Fri. and Sat. night.

We should again nominate to NWPL .  In our nomination we can state that if 
Wildhorse again wrongfully rejects our nom to NWPL, we then nominate to 
Questar solely to mitigate damages.  I can draft the appropriate letter.

Joan or Ken,

Will the nominations be done via the web site?  Do we have the information to 
nominate to NWPL via the website?

Joan, Gerald;

What is the game plan for November nominations?  Do we want to go through
the same deal as before and nominate on NWPL, get rejected, and renominate
on Questar?  Or, do we want to nominate on Questar and include a statement
that we are nominating on Questar only because of last month's ordeal?

Tom Brown and Wildhorse are supposed to close today - if they didn't get
their late last Friday.

Things are going good in legal.  I am getting to work on some interesting 
stuff.  I just finished working on a compressor deal with Mark Courtney.  It 
was an asset and finance deal.  I got to work with the finance commercial and 
legal types and learn quite a bit in a very short time.  It is hard to keep 
up with the pace and not make a total fool of myself with my lack of 
knowledge at this point.  Tense but fun.  

I didn't see the any of the high school all star games.  I heard Babers and 
Turner both looked very good in the Texas- California game.  Sounds like they 
were covering some 6'5" bad asses from California and pretty much shut them 
down.  At least that most other peoples opinion.  Sounds like Kenny Hayter 
look pretty good.  Leading Texas rusher.  He sounds like a power runner not a 
real juker.  

I am really worried about the NC State game.  It would suck to lose the home 
opener, but I think that is a very real possibility.  Their quarterback 
sounds like a stud and they have some big recievers, ala UCLA.  I still think 
we will at least go 7-4 probably 9-2 best case.  Your right though.   If we 
fall flat with 5-6 or something it will slow the momentum Mack is building.  
I just don't think that will happen.  Mack is too smart and can really get 
these kids to overchieve.  I think his players believe and are motivated to 
play hard.  Mackovic only won with offensive schemes and good athletes like 
James Brown.  When you think about it though, Mack following Mackovic is 
really going to pay dividends in the long run.  Mack Brown and Greg Davis 
weren't exactly known for their high powered offense at UNC.  But Mackovic 
had installed a strong passing game and quarterbacks which Mack and Greg 
picked right up on.  Now we have kids like Mock, Williams, and Johnson 
wanting to come here for the offensive scheme alone.  I like it.  It is going 
to be fun in about 2 years with the quality of kids we are now getting.

I will think about the groups I have worked with and let you know on any 
areas to go.  I have worked a lot with Larry Lawyer in the finance group and 
know he is looking work people.  I don't know if this was the same stuff you 
did in Denver or the same group.   Might be.  Those guys do work a lot of 
hours.  Almost as bad as attorneys.  I will give it some thought.

Well, all for now.  Keep in touch.  I am glad you are going to be back in 
Houston.  We will have some fun.  I want to hear all about how much you 
really like Australian women or more specifically, how much they like you.

G$Audrey,  Attached is a term sheet that Barbara Gray prepared some time back 
for the OE agreement.  Please review.  How does tomorrow afternoon look for 
you.  About 2:00 pm.

Ken,  Our position has been that Wildhorse doesn't have the right to curtail 
our volumes since we have a first que position.  We could draft the letter 
such that we demand to send 100% of our gas to NWPL.  In the event that 
Wildhorse would only accept noms. 50% (or some portion) of this gas to NWPL, 
we would nominate the remainder to Questar to mitigate Wildhorse's damages.  
Once they accept the nom to NWPL, they have a first que obligation to move it 
there.

From a practical standpoint, if Wildhorse curtailed us to NWPL (to our 
protest) after they had accepted our noms., I understand this would cause 
problems.  However, if we nominate gas to Questar when Wildhorse is willing 
to accept a nom to NWPL, we would potentially be waiving damages there.

Joan, Gerald:
I am wondering whether we need to send another letter as we did for the
October Nominations - to continue to show our intent to nominate 100% of gas
to NWPL.  I think this may take some more thought - as I don't want to be
given the nomination and then curtailed 50% as other producers are.

The noms can only be done via the internet if we have a Wildhorse/NWPL
transport contract number.  And as far as I know, they still will not give
us one.  So, we can either : 1) obtain the Wildhorse/NWPL transport
contract number from Tom Brown and nom via the internet to NWPL; 2) if not,
nom via internet into Questar and fax letter; or 3) fax nom to Questar,
along with letter.

Mark - what do you think our chances of getting a Wildhorse/NWPL transport
contract number are?

Hi Janel,  We have a couple of things on the agenda.  Friday night is 
Fastball at the Engine Room.  We plan on meeting on W. Alabama Ice House 
prior to the show.  Doors open at 9 pm so we will probably be at the Ice 
House around 7 ish for free dogs and cold beer.

Saturday is The Buzz Monster Mash with the Toadies.  Some placed called 
Americas near Enron Field.  Never heard of it.  There are about 3 other 
bands. Vallejo, and two others I can't remember.  Show starts at 7 pm.

Tickets are still available for both shows through ticketmaster.  There are 
about 4 to 5 people going, including myself and Eric as the foundation.  If 
you guys are interested in either or both, more people would be kickin.  Let 
me know.

One of the trading desks is ready to support a new product on EOL for 
transportation capacity.  This should be a very simple product.  At this 
point we don't need anything to feed back from EOL to Sitara at all.  The 
product can easily be added on the current gas screen with no new fields at 
all on the front screen.  We will explain the product in detail in the 
Product Description.  The attachment below shows an example of how the fields 
would look for the product, and a first draft at a Product Description.  I 
have only done a description of one product--at this time I am aware of three 
different products like this.  

Gerald, Steve--
I have made a feeble attempt at a Product Description--it obviously needs one 
of you to "fix it up".  We can discuss my intent after you have had a chance 
to review it.  Just call me once you decide who should handle this--Jeff 
Hodge suggested that I start with you two.

Dave--
What does your schedule look like the rest of the week?  I'd like to get 
together with you and get a timeline for introduction of this.  Since I don't 
think there is any major programming at all, my impression is that we could 
get something out there as quickly as we can do all the legal work.   I also 
need to know who else I need to include in this, what the next steps are, 
etc.  Please let me know the process so we can get moving.  

Thanks for your assistance.

I already have at least one interested party in this and would like to move 
forward as soon as possible to get this on the table for bids.  I would 
appreciate receiving the necessary materials by October 31, or information of 
how I can contribute to this activity.  Also, please let me know if there is

Thank you in advance for your assistance in this endeavor.Can you place these on my calendar please.  Thanks.

Hi Sophie,  

I like the sound of the Trifle described in your email to Mark.  I will have 
extra Sherry on mine.  

How is it going?  I had a great time at the party in Austin and hanging with 
you at the Brown Bar.  I am not sure what I was thinking toward the end of 
the evening by mixing Tequila and Cranberry, but I guess you have to get 
creative when the circumstances require.    I was moving a little slow the 
next day and drive back to Houston wasn't quite as pleasant.

Did you have a good weekend?  I didn't do anything real exciting for the 
weekend before Halloween.  Went to a concert that had 4 bands.  One of them 
is a band from Austin called Vallejo.  Heard of them?  

Now tell me the truth.  Do you really like Yorkshire Pudding?  Drop me a line 
when you get a chance.

GeraldA note from Bieraugel.  We need to go out and see these guys when we get a 
chance.  

Hang in there.  Things will start to come around, it is just going to take 
some time.

our London office.  Enron House is right next door to Buckingham Palace.  
Some other trading deals as well.  I usually get a pretty mixed bag of 
projects to work.  It has been very busy the last couple of days.  

Sophie Therapy?  That sounds extremely interesting.  Is it good for most of 
your normal life crisis type issues?  I might need some now and again.  

I know you probably told at the party, but as you remember my mental state 
was not clearest it could have been.  Are you a student at UT Law?  Forgive 
me for my mental lapses.

OK, I have had Yorkshire Pudding and all I remember was a bland bread type 
substance.  Now the beef, vegetables, and potatoes sounds good to me but not 
sure about the Yorkshire.  Might help to wash it down with a nice pint.

Take care,  
Gerald.

Dear Gerald,

I'm surprised you were moving at all the day after the party! I'm not to
sure on the Tequila/Cranberry mix either but as you say - it's always good
to try new things, I just wouldn't advise trying it again that's all!  I had
a good time too, wasn't that drunk either by the end which is a bit of an
unusual occurrence for me.
This past weekend we had a party put on by the law school so we went to that
Friday night and then shopped til we dropped on Saturday - my flat mate has
been having a bit of a hard time so I gave her a day of Sophie Therapy - she
seems a lot more relaxed now - I hope it will last. Saturday I also caught a
cold so I've been feeling pretty rough the last couple of days although I
think it's gradually going now so fingers-crossed I'll be okay to party hard
this weekend  - although I've no plans as yet.
Oh, I haven't heard of that band by the way but it sounds good anyway, and
yes I do like yorkshire puddings - how can anyone not - obviously you should
have the full compliment of beef, roast potatoes and vegetables and gravy
(although I'll gladly do without the beef) but they're gorgeous - don't you
think? Hmm.
Anyway, better get on with some work,
have a good week, whatever you're doing, any interesting deals?
Sophie.

Okay, brief resume of my life to date if you like:

Born, grew up, (in England), am currently studying at Nottingham University
(E. Midlands of England) although that's not strictly true as I'm here in
Texas studying at UT Law School as part of an exchange scheme. I go back in
June or whenever and finish my degree so will finally graduate in June 2002.
(Fingers crossed). Other than that I don't do much else but eat, drink and
be merry. Actually I play the viola (and sing a bit) and that took over my
life back home but here I'm doing more of the drinking part of things - more
wine than beer though it has to be said - also better for you - well,
almost!
So there you go - does that bring back any memories?!
Hope you're having a fun week, happy halloween for yesterday - though I'm
not sure how fanatical people are about it in Houston - they certainly seem
to go all out for making a big deal of it here!
Sophie.

If we did sign it prior to getting bank approval, we would likely have to 
make the WIC portion of the release, subject to the bank approval.  Otherwise 
Huber could be put into the position of having the obligations but being 
unable to complete it obligation due to a WIC process out of Huber's 
control.  But assuming that was done, I don't see why we couldn't sign the 
agreement now.

		 Subject: Huber WIC capacity assignment

I spoke with Steve Saye at WIC today and he said that they interpret the 
tarrif to read that a release done at the full negotiated contract rate is 
the same as the maximum rate. Therefore we can release at the $.12 rate.  He 
also stated that he would begin the approval process with the banks for the 
release but thought that there would be no problem with Huber's credit.  He 
did state that the bank approval timing was out of his control but he would 
try to expedite it. In addition, he felt that the best way to do the release 
was to do it  with the first bidder meeting minimum terms and have Huber 
ready to take it.  He said that it would not have to be noticed ahead of time 
so noone would know that it was going  to hit the board.

My question is, can we get the contract with Huber signed prior to receiving 
the bank approval for the WIC peice?

Mark
I haven't answered him yet.  I just plan to let him know that the contracts 
should be executed next week with the capacity release to occur thereafter.  
Any thoughts?

Gerald,

Can you please let me know where we stand with the execution of the JM Huber 
transactions and contracts that is being originated in the Denver office.  As 
you are aware the first transaction and contract we entered into did not 
contain the assignment language for the transportation on a yearly basis.  
The second transaction was to include this assignment language.  ENA 
currently has large exposure from JM Huber for the first transaction because 
the assignment contracts have not been signed as of yet, as far as I am 
aware.  If the contract negotiations are going to continue for an extended 
period of time, Credit is going to have to reserve the transactions to cover 
this exposure.  Please let me know what the status is.

Thank you,

I will remove the open season reference.  Some pipeline tariffs do refer to 
open season for capacity release, but it may cause confusion so probably to 
remove it.

The terms you referenced are defined in the product description.  The EOL 
access agreement makes it clear that the product description is binding on 
the counterparty.

		 Subject: New Product--Suggested Language Changes

Last week I sent copies of the product description and GTC to Becky Cantrell 
(regulatory) for comments and she did make a couple of suggestions which I 
agree with.  First, in both the description and the original GTC we refer to 
an open season; however, this product is for capacity release, which would 
not be subject to an open season--only bidding.  So, Gerald, unless you have 
some objection that we have overlooked, I believe it is appropriate to remove 
the words "or open season" in the product description.  Regarding the GTC, 
since we were planning on eliminating Paragraph 3 anyway, which had the open 
season reference, I think that one is already taken care of.

The other question she had is how we would define the following terms and how 
they would be made a part of the contract:  Reference Pipeline, Rate 
Schedule, Primary Receipt and Delivery Point.  Please let me know your 
thoughts on this.


Attached are a redlined revised version of the GTC and the Product 
Description based on our comments discussions of the previous versions.  
Carlos, I made a few slight changes to the product description you sent 
earlier today   Please review.
Russell,  The 2nd Huber transaction was executed and Huber is contractually 
bound to take assignment of the transportation.  We have gotten approval of 
the assignment form from the Pipeline and expect to execute the assignments 
and capacity release documents with Huber next week.  The capacity release 
document just specifies the details of the capacity release.  Huber is bound 
by the 2nd transaction to accept our release.    I will let you know when 
these sets of documents are executed.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Jackie/Gerald
We have done a term deal with Entex Gas Marketing starting August 1, 1999. 
The term is for one year and will end July 31, 2000. This is a point specific 
deal. The delivery point is meter 8078/ Rhone Poulen Chemical Plant (Rhodia). 
The receipt points will be meter 4132/ Exxon Katy Plant Tail Gate, meter 
6780/ Oasis Katy, meter 0067/ Lone Star Katy, meter 0072/ Western Katy. The 
out rate at meter 8078 is $.075. The in rate at meters 4132, 6780, 0067, & 
0072, is $.03. This deal was done for full plant requirements up to 1,750 
MMBtus/day. We have a Intrastate Master receipt/delivery contract already set 
up with Entex Gas Marketing (012-27106-02-001). I would like for us to do a 
confirmation for this deal under this contract, and assign it a different 
number for scheduling to schedule on. Please let me know what this number 
will be so I can make all parties aware.

Hi Marsha,    How is it going?  Nothing really exciting since Cabo.  Just 
work.  I am about to go to Spain for  8 days.  Should be fun.  Amazingly, I

>> >>INEXPERIENCED CHILI TASTER
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>These are notes from an inexperienced chili taster named FRANK, who was
>>
>> >>visiting Texas from New Jersey and fell into it:
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>"Recently I was lucky enough to be the 10,000th attendee at the State
>>
>> >>Fair in Texas, and was asked to fill in to be a judge
>>
>> >>at a chili cook-off. Apparently the original judge #3 called in sick at
>>
>> >>the last moment, and I happened to be standing
>>
>> >>there when the call came in. I was assured by the other two judges
>>
>> >>(Native Texans) that it would be a fun event and a true
>>
>> >>taste of Texas hospitality. They assured me that the chili wouldn't be
>>
>> >>all that spicy, and besides they told me I could
>>
>> >>have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted. Here are the
>>
>> >>scorecards from the event:
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.
>>
>> >>FRANK: Holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried
>>
>> >>paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers
>>
>> >>to put the flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans are
>>
>> >>crazy.
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken
>>
>> >>seriously.
>>
>> >>FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am
>>
>> >>supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two
>>
>> >>people who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to
>>
>> >>walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on my face.
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >> Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.
>>
>> >>FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the
>>
>> >>routine by now. Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in
>>
>> >>the front part of my chest. 'm getting shit-faced.
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >> Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or
>>
>> >>other mild foods, not much of a chili.
>>
>> >>FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to
>>
>> >>taste it. Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me
>>
>> >>with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look HOT, just
>>
>> >>like this nuclear-waste I'm eating.
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding
>>
>> >>considerable kick. Very impressive.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.
>>
>> >>FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>and four people behind me needed paramedics. The
>>
>> >>contestant seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given me
>>
>> >>brain damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding
>>
>> >>by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. It really pisses me off
>>
>> >>that the other judges asked me to stop screaming.
>>
>> >>Screw those rednecks!
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >> Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of
>>
>> >>spice and peppers.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic.
>>
>> >>Superb.
>>
>> >>FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous,
>>
>> >>sulfuric flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me
>>
>> >>except that slut Sally. I need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of
>>
>> >>chili peppers at the last moment. I should note that I
>>
>> >>am worried about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit of distress
>>
>> >>as he is cursing uncontrollably.
>>
>> >>FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I
>>wouldn't
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye,
>>
>> >>and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is
>>
>> >>covered with chili which slid unnoticed out of my mouth.
>>
>> >>My pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. At least
>>
>> >>during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. I've
>>
>> >>decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. Screw it, I'm not getting
>>
>> >>any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just suck
>>
>> >>it in through the 4inch hole in my stomach.
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >> Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili
>>
>> >>
>>
>> >>JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all,
>>
>> >>not too bold but spicy enough to declare its existence.
>>
>> >>JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor
>>
>> >>hot. Sorry to see that most of it was lost when
>>
>> >>Judge Number 3 passed out, fell and pulled the chili pot on top of
>>
>> >>himself. Not sure if he's going to make it. Poor Yank.

Hi Melissa,

Thanks for the call.  I thought it might be easier to communicate via email 
since we are both kind of difficult to reach via phone.  Sounds like they 
keep you busy at V&E.

Yes, I do work for Enron.  I am an attorney for Enron North America in gas 
and power origination.   I actually worked with some attorney's from V&E on a 
couple of asset financing deals we did about a year ago.  Terry Yates and 
David Keyes.  Joel Ephross also worked on those deals, but he is now at Enron 
in our Global Finance Legal Group.  

Sounds like you have worked alot on Enron deals.  I know we keep you guys 
pretty loaded with work.  Who are your Enron contacts?  Enron is a big place, 
but I might know them.

Lunch sounds great.  The 14th works for me.  Any preferences as to location?

In case you were wondering about how Ann Wukasch and I know each other; Ann 
and I met at my sister's wedding in Colorado.  My sister and Ann are good 
friends and work at the same school in Dallas.   Ann is a trip!


Gerald Attached is a redline with the changes per my discussion with Colleen.  
Please review.
Ken,  Attached is the form of ROW Agreement and Exhibit B that goes along 
with it.
Revised GTC

Attached is the revised GTC based on the latest discussion concerning 
secondary points.  Attached is a clean and redlined version.


One more revision to the GTC.  Few changes based on my discussion with Carl 
this morning.  I have attached a clean and redlined copy.  The redline is 
compared against the version prior to the secondary point discussion for 
Colleen's benefit.  I am fine to run with this copy from a legal perspective 
unless Dick or Colleen had any comments.
Eric, The agreement needs to be bi-directional.  The subject is an exchange 
of information concerning Petroglyph's transportation contract Colorado 
Interstate Gas Company.  Paul is going to provide the date of the contract 
and the contract #.

Let me just start by saying that if you to knuckleheads (Eric and Jen) would 
spend less time obsessing about my hair and more time working on your house, 
then maybe you would have a kitchen that didn't look like it belongs on Bob 
Vila's "This Old House".  Second, the style of my hair is not a pomp, as you 
"commoners" like to refer.  Once we arrive in Madrid, the Madrilenos will 
recognize me at once as royalty and I should be running that country inside 
of 2 days.

Matt,  If you are still gassy by next week, you will be rooming with Eric and 
Jen.

Eric and I can type up a couple of possible itineraries this weekend, based
upon some initial research. It'll include potential routes and possible
sights to see along the way. I think we can basically decide as we go. We
are also having dinner with someone Eric works with this Friday who has
been to Spain recently with his family. They went down to the Andulusian
White Hill towns near Seville. As you know, Eric and I were only in and
around Madrid, so we'll pick this guy's brain. I agree about packing light.
It sounds like we'll need a few sweaters though. I think it'll be between
50-60 during the day. I don't know if they have heat in Spain yet, so we
may get cold at night. I'm pretty confident we could find a laundry mat if
necessary. I don't want you to stink either, especially if you blow your
butt out like in Minneapolis! Nasty!!! Please bring your adapter. I blow
dry my hair in the mornings. Gerald will need to borrow it too in order to
dry his pomp. Eric and I felt that it would be easier to make our hotel
reservations once we get there. On day one, we arrive in the morning. Thus,
we'll have plenty of time to check out a couple of pre-determined hotel
options, especially since we're not in high season. We can discuss this
weekend.

Chao!

Attached is the draft.  Please review.  I left a question about the cash-out 
index.  Please let me know what is appropriate.
Miyako sounds great.  Why don't we meet there at 12:00.  

I didn't get to know Terry that well.  I was pretty green at that point.  
That was actually the first deal I worked on when I got to legal.  I went to 
law school a little later in life.  I have been practicing for about 2 
years.  Terry reminded me of an absent minded professor.  He had this pair of 
glasses that during the course of the deal, they became more and more broken 
down.  By the end, one of the ear pieces was missing and they barely stayed 
on his face.  At the closing dinner Enron bought him a new pair of glasses.

South America.  That sounds pretty interesting, ever travel down there?

Greg,  Attached is a draft of interconnect agreement form based on the 
discussion we had yesterday.  I left the reimbursement provision open with 
only placeholder language that indicated they will be paying for the 
interconnect in some form.  I made some assumptions about equipment that 
either party would install, however this can easily be changed.

I didn't draft any credit language in the agreement.  I think this would be 
best handle by simply having our credit department review these guys and if 
they are worried about them, we should require them to make an upfront 
payment before we buy or build anything.  Take a look at the draft and let me 
know if you have any questions.
Mark,  Attached are clean versions of the set of documents to be executed by 
Huber.





The following are redlines copies of the documents that were changed from our 
prior versions.






Mark,  A couple of notes:

1.  In the capacity release agreement - Are the volumes specified in Section 
2.1 correct?  Or do these need to be grossed up for fuel?
2.  In Section 2.4, I took out any requirement of Huber to release WIC 
Capacity back to ENA if the start date under the purchase agreement occurs 
later than the start of the term of the WIC Capacity Release from ENA to 
Huber which we will effectuate soon.  Is this correct?Hey,

Yes, I am still headed to Spain.  I am actually leaving on Friday, so I need 
to get those tickets to you pretty soon.  Let me know what days you are in 
town this week.

The 8th works for me. Where is the Duke party this year?

Hey man!  Haven't talked to you in awhile.  Hope things are good.  David
reminded me about the game the other day.  Are you still headed to Spain
for Thanksgiving?  If so, let me know when you want to get together and do
the ticket/money swap.  I'll be in Florida this weekend, but should be home
on weekends after that for awhile.  Or, we can do it one week night if I'm
in town.  Unfortunately, my travel schedule is not slowing down around the
holidays like I'd hoped.

I also have another favor to ask - is there any chance you would go to our
Christmas party with me on Dec 8 if I go?  David will obviously be there,
too.  I'm such a loser that I've had to go by myself the last three years
and that's such a drag.  Let me know if you think you'd consider it.

Attached are the redlined docs for the docs with changes.  I made some more 
changes to the Capacity Release doc to clean several items up.
Redline of the changes we discussed.
It would probably be easiest for me to mail them to you.  What is your

Hey man!  Haven't talked to you in awhile.  Hope things are good.  David
reminded me about the game the other day.  Are you still headed to Spain
for Thanksgiving?  If so, let me know when you want to get together and do
the ticket/money swap.  I'll be in Florida this weekend, but should be home
on weekends after that for awhile.  Or, we can do it one week night if I'm
in town.  Unfortunately, my travel schedule is not slowing down around the
holidays like I'd hoped.

I also have another favor to ask - is there any chance you would go to our
Christmas party with me on Dec 8 if I go?  David will obviously be there,
too.  I'm such a loser that I've had to go by myself the last three years
and that's such a drag.  Let me know if you think you'd consider it.










FYI,  This is how the capacity release product will look on EOL.

Mary,  Thanks for the invite to the Open House.  Unfortunately, I will be out 
of the country on vacation next week.  Have a Happy Thanksgiving.You are very welcome!  I enjoyed it.

 Thanks for the name of the city.  We will probably be in Lisbon 2 days, so 
we'll try to check it out.  Thanksgiving in Spain/Portugal should be 
interesting?  Probably won't be able to find turkey, dressing, or american 
football anywhere.   Any fun plans for the Thanksgiving holiday?

Miyako sounds great.  Why don't we meet there at 12:00.

I didn't get to know Terry that well.  I was pretty green at that point.
That was actually the first deal I worked on when I got to legal.  I went
to law school a little later in life.  I have been practicing for about 2
years.  Terry reminded me of an absent minded professor.  He had this pair
of glasses that during the course of the deal, they became more and more
broken down.  By the end, one of the ear pieces was missing and they barely
stayed on his face.  At the closing dinner Enron bought him a new pair of
glasses.

South America.  That sounds pretty interesting, ever travel down there?

hi gn. so funny...terry and david are in my group. i don't know david as
well really, but terry is a good friend and is a total riot! i don't know
how well you got to know him, but he really is just great. anyway, i have
really been working with enron south america on the cuiaba project
exclusively for the past year and a half. the enron attorneys are randy
young and john novak. prior to that i did a few structured deals --
christina mordaunt was the atty.

yes, annie wu (we just call her "the wu") is a stitch! remind me to tell
you
the story about when she came to visit me in london...and a few other
stories. she is a trip! truly a sweet person and a good friend too. i heard
you know my friend walter daniel, too. he was in my law school class and is
also a good friend.

whenever/wherever on the 14th is fine. do you like sushi? we could go to
miyako...or zydeco or becks? those are the places where i usually meet
enron
folks since they are in between... let me know! mb

Hi Melissa,

Thanks for the call.  I thought it might be easier to communicate via email
since we are both kind of difficult to reach via phone.  Sounds like they
keep you busy at V&E.

Yes, I do work for Enron.  I am an attorney for Enron North America in gas
and power origination.   I actually worked with some attorney's from V&E on
a couple of asset financing deals we did about a year ago.  Terry Yates and
David Keyes.  Joel Ephross also worked on those deals, but he is now at
Enron in our Global Finance Legal Group.

Sounds like you have worked alot on Enron deals.  I know we keep you guys
pretty loaded with work.  Who are your Enron contacts?  Enron is a big
place, but I might know them.

Lunch sounds great.  The 14th works for me.  Any preferences as to
location?

In case you were wondering about how Ann Wukasch and I know each other; Ann
and I met at my sister's wedding in Colorado.  My sister and Ann are good
friends and work at the same school in Dallas.   Ann is a trip!

Hey Melissa,

I am trying desperately to do everything I need to before I leave tomorrow.  
We are in the middle of performance reviews at Enron and I have to review 
about 10 others that I work with.  These are not easy to complete, but I 
guess I'll get through them.

Wanted to wish you a Happy Thanksgiving before I left.  Have fun in FW and at 
the game.  That is the hardest part of going to Spain right now.  I sold my 
tickets to the game, but I will be there in spirit.

We ought to go get some dinner after I get back.  I will be back next 
Monday.  Hopefully I won't have any disaster vacation stories of the type you 
told me at lunch!

Take care,  

GeraldHello!

Yes, I leave for Spain tomorrow at 1:30.  We arrive in Madrid about 8 am on 
Sat. Morning.  We will be in Madrid a couple of days, then spend our time in 
some towns south of Madrid for about 3 days.    The last couple of days we 
will be in Lisbon, Portugal.  Back in Houston next Monday.    Should be a 
good time.  I will let you guys know all about it at Christmas time.  Sounds 
like yall had a fun trip to Big Bend.  I have wanted to see the McDonalds 
Observatory.  That sounds pretty cool.

Anyway,  thanks for the updates and I will talk to you as soon as I get back.

I hear that you are going to Spain during the Thanksgiving Holidays? When

details before you leave huh!!!!
           We just got back from our Big Bend trip Tuesday evening. We
really enjoyed it the mountains are awesome, you have to see it to get full
effect of it. We saw Bracketville where they made the film Alamo and
Lonesome Dove. That was really neat. Then we drove to Alpine and Fort Davis.
We spent the night in the Davis Mountains Indian Lodge. We also saw Fort
Collins,that night and the next day we drove to the McDonalds Observatory in
the Davis Mountains. We got to look through all the big telescopes at the
moon, venus, and saturn. The next day we went back to look at the sun and
they took us to the Hobby Eberle telescope and told us all about it. Then we
drove to Big Bend Park and stayed at the Lodge at the base of the Chiso
Mountains. There is so many variations of rocks, mountains and deserts in
that area. It was really something to see.
   James came over the other day and I was keeping Jacob, so I let them draw
names for Christmas you have James's name and they didn't cheat either
Ha..... well all for now Dad and I send our love hope all is going
well........Love MOM 
I'm back.  I will review and comment on their responses.

hi gerald,  where do we stand in getting that agency agreement between ENA 
and crescendo?

thanks



Ken,  I sent, via fedex, an agency agreement to you a couple of weeks ago.  
The agreement appointed ENA as Crescendo's agent to nominate and resolve 
allocations and imbalances on Wildhorse's system.  Wanted to see if you have 
reviewed and executed yet?  Attached is a letter to Wildhorse consenting to the assignment of Crescendo's 
gathering agreements from Wildhorse to Tom Brown.  The letter reserves all 
our rights for Wildhorse's breach.  Also attached is a letter for December 
nominations into Questar reserving our rights.  Please review and provide any 
comments.
The letter looks fine Nicole.  Only checked it for form and not substance 
since I didn't have the agreement to which it is referring.

Jere, 

 I have the confidentiality agreements fully executed on our side.  What is 
your address, so I can forward to you for execution by Tri-State.  Thanks.Hi MB,

Not sure if you are in the office this week, but if you are, wanted to see if 
you would want to meet for a drink after work today? Mark,  I reviewed the CSA for our obligations.  They are as follows:

1.  ECS will work with the Utility in good faith to establish the online 
monitoring automatic load controlling system for the No. 21 Schedule.

2.  If the online system can not be established, then ECS will work with TW 
to develop a manual system to accomplish the same.  ECS will keep TW whole on 
any costs for incremental manpower required for such manual system.

This provision was written very generally.

Gerald, here is the address I have for Jere.  I was discussing this with him 
today.  
Lets get it over to them so we can get the monitoring system going.  He 
indicated
that Tri-State is in the process of changing/modifying how they monitor and 
charge
for demand or peaking service.  I'm real interested to see what this is.  

Under our CSA we are required to provide TW/ET&S with some type of system to
monitor the peaking from Tri-State (hence this conf. agreement).  The 
resources that
we needed from EE&CC are now gone due to the restructure between EE&CC, 
EES and ET&S.  It's going to be money out of ECS's pocket I believe despite 
the fact
that it was part of our agreement with EE&CC for the turnkey construction 
quote.  I also
need to discuss with Courtney since he was heading up this effort.  

We may need to review exactly what our obligations are under the agreement.  
Oh, by
the way, TW is developing an expansion of Gallup to up the system to a full 
12,000 hp
from 10,000.

I have reviewed the Oneok Westex Transmission Agreement.  The only comment I 
have is that the daily balance cashout requirements in Section F of the 
General Terms and Conditions seem very burdensome.  This is really a business 
call, but the 5% tolerance or cashout everyday might be difficult to 
maintain.  I will leave that to you to decide Stacey.  I am OK with 
everything else.
I can't hear you!! La La La La La La La.....................No problem.  I figured you weren't feeling well.  Sorry to hear that you are 
still sick.  You might want to call the doc.  I have been able to described 
my symptoms to her before and she usually calls in a prescription for me 
(Antibiotics or similar).  

Good luck with Global Markets.  Sounds like you had a lot of good 
opportunities.  I think you will learn a lot by trading which will make you a 
better originator if you ever want to go back to origination.  

I am pretty open right now for lunch.  Maybe Wednesday.  Let me know.

		 Subject: Texas General Land Office IT Transport

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.I will draft a letter to Wildhorse concerning the pressure situation.  We 
have previously sent a demand letter on Sept. 29 for pressure data for the 3 
year period, with no response from Wildhorse.  We need to reinforce the 
curtailment that the high pressure is causing the resultant loss of profits.  
I will circulate the letter for review by the group before sending.

Joan, Gerald, Mark,

We do not physically flow our gas into Questar. This means that our
production is being curtailed (through increased pressure) for economic
benefit to Wildhorse (at Crescendo's expense) of moving more gas from the
Natural Buttes area south through the San Arroyo area.

Subject: Crescendo Dec Production



Due to the Mesa Tap compressor being down at the interconnect between
Wildhorse and Questar, the pressure is backing up on Wildhorse.  These
Crescendo wells are very sensitive to pressure, thus current production is
around 2,500 mcf/d [2,675 mmbtud/].  Our first of the month nom was 2,800
mcf/d [3,000 mmbtu/d].

I am not sure if you want to reduce the nom now or wait a bit.  My gut feel
is to keep the nom as is and get these higher prices - assuming prices will
come down later this month.  let me know what you think is best.

thanks
joan



Attached is my revised letter.  Please call with any questions.
I am glad you asked me to lunch today.  I do enjoy spending time with you 
even though at times it is tough and our conversations are hard right now.  I 
do Love You so much and have a Vision.Attached is a clean and redlined version with my changes.   Please note the 
following:

1.  I added back the limitation on damage provision I originally had.  We 
need to be clear that the remedies specified in the amendment are the only 
remedies.
2.  Changed both Seller and Buyer Minimum Volume Obligations to be consistent 
with each other.

The amendment for the Powder River contract should reflect the same.  Please 
contact me at (713) 853-3512 if you would like to discuss.



Attached is the revised letter based on Chris' voicemail on Friday.  I also 
added a 30 day window during which ENAP must provide the data to Enron.  
Please review and let me know if you have any questions.  Note that we still 
need to legal entity's name from the South America office.

We settled up on the tix.  You gave me some cash.  We're good.

I have never been to Acapulco.  The only place on the Pacific side I have 
been to is Cabo.  Most people that have been to Acapulco really like it 
though.

Don't worry about the end of the evening.  Strange things always happen at 6 
am after we have been up all night.  Forget about it.  Have fun in
