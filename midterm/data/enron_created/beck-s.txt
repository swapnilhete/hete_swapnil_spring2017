Sally,

Have been thinking quite a bit about the work news you told me.  We were
talking about you last night with Mom and Dad.  You really have such a great
gift--you must be able to be able to work so hard, focus so concretely, AND
come up with creative solutions AND manage people.

If I haven't said it recently, I am very proud of you!

Love,

Cindy




Yes, we will definitely host you and the students to a tour of Enron Field 
and dinner on the evening of January 31 (if that is still the best night for 
your schedule).  I talked with Lexie earlier this week and told her that I 
was going to cover this, and she thought that she could find some dollars in 
her budget so that we can perhaps split the cost. Either way, consider it 
done.  I am glad that you are including the names of the students to attend.  
However, checking the attachment on your second e:mail message, I can not 
bring up the attachment.   Can you try that again and check with Patti to 
make sure she has it in readable form?  I will be in London all of next week, 
and I would like to send invitations to the students about the tour and 
dinner.  I will need their e:mail addresses to do so.  I don't know whether 
or not you included that on your list.  

Jody said that Ruggles for game watching was really cold!!  I wonder if that 
could be a problem on the 31st?  You never know with Houston weather.  What 
do you think?  We could do the tour and then go to Irma's Southwest Grill (2 
blocks from the stadium, same great food with a more sleek atmosphere - owned 
by Irma's son, Luis).  

I will be in touch with Patti while I am in London next week to make sure 
that plans are progressing on this.   We will include our recent OU grads as 
well.  

I will save your championship game souvenirs and give them to you when I see 
at the end of January.  --Sally Thanks for the responses -- all look great.  I like coming over knowing that 
my calendar will be pretty full.  Dinner sounds great, too.  I am having 
dinner with Beth Apollo on Monday evening to talk more about her assignment.  
I received a note from Fernley asking about dinner on Thursday evening also.  

Hope that the New York trip was worthwhile and that the trip back was 
smooth.  --Sally

Subject: Topics for next week

Well, I didn't get this out to you before I left the office last night.  I 
was still pouring over bonus info until 9:30, and decided to call it quits at 
that point.  Here are some of the things that I would like to do next week:

 review your action plan to move the close and officialization of London 
books to same day, - certainly want to review this in detail with you - the 
issue being that we may not in the short/medium term be able to change 
systems infrastructure to run same day - but with a combination of process 
and tactical systems enhancements we may be able to deliver no action p&l, 
new activity p&l and position signoff on trade date with 'officialisation' of 
books on T+1 in time for RAC VAR explain and limit monitoring process

Also I would like to go through our credit difficulties with you and Ted at 
same time - more for information on this  - because when we 'solve' market 
risk reporting issues we will face big push to 'clean' credit exposure 
reporting process - Office of Chair is very insistent on this

 to replicate, if appropriate,  an Operational Risk information session for 
London counterparts (you and I can  review early in the week what we are 
doing here in Houston today and modify the info for Europe) 
Would defintely welcome this - I can walk through the European MO issues 
trying to identify key operational risk themes - top of my list is Metals

I would like to spend some time on Metals with you - hence the lunch on 
Wednesday with Andy Cornfield and Howard Carter the two controllers for 
Metals ( Brokerage and Merchanting ) - the starting place for this will be 
the presentation I gave to Rick Causey in early December.

 discuss the Doorstep process with you and, if you deem appropriate, your 
business controllers in the   London office who will participate in Doorstep 
reviews this year (clear up and questions and get your input  on how to 
continually improve the process), 
Would like to brainstorm the linkage between control standards reporting, 
self assessment of Op risk and doorstep - this can be done initially in a 
small group but additionally I believe the business controllers would welcome 
some more background of why Rick,Rick and yourself need the process to be 
successful - I think they understand ( I have fully promoted it ) but your 
'asides' explaining the weight Jeff assigns to it are very powerful motivators

 discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London office 
related to speeding up   London's information for the corporate DPR
As explained above - additionally I would like to walk you through the 
implementation of our change management structure which attempts to cross 
prioritise all IT development efforts - a meeting with Steve Whitaker, Mark 
and Fernley on this would be useful

 do some planning with you for the February 12 & 13 ASE - certainly in 
calendar and signed off by the executive committee of one ( my wife !!! )

 discuss the feasibility of utilizing our operational pricing model in London 
 - can you let me know some more of this - I am uncertain of it

 discuss your ideas and thoughts on CommodityLogic and other ideas around 
potential commercialization of  mid and back office services - The below is a 
section of an objective I am asking my settlements director to follow - I 
would like to expand on these and other thoughts - particularly the absence 
of vision/strategy documentation for CL

Lead on all CommodityLogic initiatives associated with Settlements ( note 
this is my definition of what CL should be doing ) including :-
Changing Market practices
create cashflow messaging within each transaction
create payment advice notification for each transaction at inception and 
liquidation 
re-evaluate operational cost structure associated with any possible changes 
to terms of trade
Module/Application developments
Synergy from internal process changes ( pulling Settlements and Documentation 
together )
elimination of paper/fax confirmation processes if we can utilise electronic 
messaging of cashflow details within transactions and electronic messaging of 
payment advices at inception ( based upon planned trade settlement  ) and at 
liquidation ( based upon actual trade settlement )

 
In addition, I would like to meet with anyone in the London office that you 
think would be beneficial.  Through Nicki Scott, I understand that Michael 
Brown would like to meet with me so we are setting that up.  I will also 
spend some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy while I am there.  And I plan 
to meet with Fernley as well.  

Any other suggestions on topics or people to see?  Can I suggest we also 
cover 
Remote offices with Naomi Connell
The ledger control process - similarities and differences with Houston
Static reference control processes - ( Global 
Counterparties/Companies/Contracts/Facilities etc )
Themes from our business process reengineering reviews prior to Christmas - 
similar to bottom up Op risk assessment
A gap analysis for the risk management team - explaining the 'legacy' work 
that James New has been leading on 
Our plans for EAS in Europe 

I shall call to discuss / prioritise and then I can instruct Fiona to 
organise meetings

Mike

  
I think that we have lunch already on the calendar for Wednesday - as above 
but would you also be available for dinner with the controllers and Fernley ?




I am glad that you asked!  I will be happy to bring your things back for 
you.  Niki is finding a spot for me to occupy while I am there next week and 
she is coordinating my schedule, so we see one another quite a bit.  It will 
be easy to do this.  --Sally

If your kind offer still stands, I have just thought of something I need from 
London.  I had ordered some beauty products from the salon in the Tonezone 
and they are now in (cleanser, toner and exfoliator).  If it's not too much 
trouble would you mind bring them back for me?  I will have them delivered to 
Niki Scott just in case.  They are already paid for.  If you do not get a 
chance, not to worry, I'll just have them shipped.

Thank you very much.  Have a safe trip.

Nicki

Let's plan on Monday night for dinner.  Someone included me on the 
distribution list for your going away bash, so I have put that on my calendar 
for Wednesday night as well.  --Sally

Frank and I are staying at the Sheraton Belgravia which is about a 5 minute 
walk to our office  -- it is small and quiet but nice rooms.  It is not on a 
major street like Picadilly or Park Lane, but we like it.  The rate is about 
o190 a night

We had to move out of our flat on Monday, so are staying there until we 
leave.  Right now we are scheduled to fly out on Sat the 20th.

Also --- just a few notes on next week

I am free Monday night if you would like to have dinner.  I know Frank and 
Maureen will be in Spain that night, they are back on Tuesday  

Also my going away party that Fernley is throwing is on Wed night -- so 
hopefully most people will drop by there.  It is just a pub thing near the 
office, but hopefully you can make it!  I am sure there will be dinner or 
something afterwards.  

Talk to you soon

Beth

Right now, I am booked at 47 Park for next week.  I would love to be closer 
to the office, but I don't know if there is anything that makes sense.  Any 
suggestions?  If not something close to the office, would you suggest another 
spot besides 47 Park?  

I am committed to working on my agenda for next week before I leave the 
office tonight.  I will e:mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time 
to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner, too.  --Sally 




Thanks!  I understand that congratulations are in order for you, too.  We 
should definitely do dinner and celebrate.  I think that Niki has arranged 
that for Thursday night.  I will look forward to it.  --Sally

Hi Sally - and a Happy New Year. Sounds like you, David and the kids had a 
great time (baking - my word you are a lady of many talents!)

I certainly would like to spend some time with you next week and I'll ask 
Niki to work me in to your schedule - I'd love to have dinner one evening if 
that suits.

Congratulations!

Subject: Visit to London

I hope that your holidays were wonderful.  I thoroughly enjoyed the week of 
vacation that I took before Christmas.  It was fun to be home with the 
children, although I certainly worked hard -- up every night until very late 
either baking or wrapping gifts or writing notes on last minute Christmas 
cards.  

I plan to be in the London office next week.  I will leave Houston on Sunday 
evening and will arrive in London Monday morning.  After a stop by the hotel, 
I should be in the office after lunch.  I plan to be there through Thursday, 
and will fly back to Houston on Friday morning.  

I have a number of things planned to review with Mike Jordan.  Some of the 
major goals for the trip are:

 to review Mike Jordan's action plan to move the close and officialization of 
London books to same  day,

 to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts 
(we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 for managers and above within 
Operations for EA, EGM and EIM),

 to discuss the Doorstep process with Mike's business controllers in the 
London office who will participate in  Doorstep reviews this year, 

 to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London 
office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR

Other things planned are spending some time with Beth Apollo and Ted Murphy.  
Ted and I will have a conference call with Shona and Cassandra (and team) for 
a download on the New York metals Doorstep review that is taking place this 
week.  

I would welcome your participation in any or all of the above.  In addition, 
I hope that you may have some time for the two of us to touch base.  Also, if 
you have an opening for lunch or dinner, do let me know.  I have been in the 
throws of bonus allocations this week, but hope that today I can start to 
finalize my calendar for next week.  --Sally

Hey there -- hope the weekend was good.  I think I will still plan to come -- 
as I can handle some of my personal things re: moving home -- house etc.  on 
Thursday Friday and meet up with others on Wed.

So ---- go ahead and pencil me in for Mon and Tuesday the 13th and 14th.

I will assume that you and Patti will mostly fill my calendar on those two 
days, so will have Janine put other meetings the rest of that week.

Will check on the agenda next week, before I leave London.

The week of November 13 is the week of the Enron Management Conference in San 
Antonio.  It begins on Wednesday evening, so most people will be travelling 
on Wednesday afternoon.  I will be in the office on Monday and Tuesday that 
week, so those days work well for me for your visit.   I just wanted you to 
know about the conference in case that has an impact on other meetings that 
you might want to have in Houston that week.  Let me know.  I will look 
forward to seeing you and introducing you to others on the team.  

We are looking forward to seeing Mo next week here in Houston.  

Have a great weekend.  --Sally

Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

Beth

I plan to work out of the London office during the week of January 15.  I 
will leave Houston on Sunday and will be in the London office starting around 
noon on Monday.  I will be back in the Houston office on Monday, January 22.  
The primary goals of the trip are:

  to work with Mike Jordan on an action plan to move the close and 
officialization of London books to same  day,

 to replicate an Operational Risk information session for London counterparts 
(we are doing this in Houston  on January 11 per my e:mail to you for 
managers and above within Operations),

 to hold a training session for business controllers in the London office who 
will participate in Doorstep   reviews this year (outside EEL), 

 to discuss with Mark Pickering the technology dependencies of the London 
office related to speeding up  London's information for the corporate DPR

 Patti Thompson (x39106) will have a detailed itinerary in hand if you need 
to reach me at any time next week.  I love it!!  I think that is perfect.  Much easier for my family and probably 
for everyone else.  That way we can probably do this on their anniversary, 
assuming that works for everyone.  Removing some of the travel hassels should 
mean that everyone would have a better time, too.  Hyatt Hill Country is one 
obvious choice - I was there in November and it is still very nice.  There is 
a newer resort in the area also.  I can't think of the name of it offhand, 
but David knows and I will get the name from him tonight and call you.

Sally - A new idea popped into my head - I don't know if it makes things
easier - or if everyone would like the idea, but here goes:

What if we gathered, as a whole family, for a couple of days, somewhere easy
- in Texas - like the Hill Country Hyatt, or somehwere in Galveston, or the
YO Ranch or somewhere.   We might spend one night or two - plan something
fun for the kids, get a big suite where the adults could toast mom and dad
with champagne and appetizers - spend time playing games, whatever - just go
somewhere easy - and just spend a day or two.

Then, at that event, we could give Mom and Dad a gift certificate for a more
special (and far-away) trip for them - like a four-day weekend in San
Francisco - or somewhere they'd really like to go.

This would eliminate travel hassles for all of the families involved - but
provide us all an opporunity (albeit condensed) to get together - and Mom
and Dad would still get to go someplace fun.    Maybe we could "chip in"
varying amounts to Mom and Dad's trip so that cindy and richard could afford
it.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Right now, I am booked at 47 Park for next week.  I would love to be closer 
to the office, but I don't know if there is anything that makes sense.  Any 
suggestions?  If not something close to the office, would you suggest another 
spot besides 47 Park?  

I am committed to working on my agenda for next week before I leave the 
office tonight.  I will e:mail you tomorrow to see if we can schedule a time 
to meet and hopefully a lunch or dinner, too.  --Sally I will attend the meeting on Thursday, but will have to leave around 1:15 to 
make it to a meeting at the Doubletree where I am speaking at 1:30.  Thanks.

Subject: Lagrasta Origination

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Please see following details for Thursday's operational risk meeting:

I knew that you would still be in London.  Just thought that I would start to 
copy you on some things so that you could begin to get a feel for what's 
going on.  Yes, I will be in London next week.  Plan to fly over on Sunday 
night and will be in the office around noon on Monday.  I will be there 
through Thursday, and will plan to fly back to Houston on Friday.  Let's 
definitely plan to get together.  I am in the throws of bonus reviews at this 
moment (I am cooling my heels waiting for HR to get me info on people that 
were left off of my sheet), so a little later today I will focus on my 
schedule for next week.  I will send an e:mail later in the day to see when 
we can get together.  Looking forward to it.  --Sally

Subject: January 11 - Managing Operational Risk

Please join me on Thursday, January 11 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm for a special 
information session for the Operations Management teams supporting Enron 
Americas, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets.   We will focus 
on assessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  Details on the 
location for the meeting will be sent to you early next week.  

I look forward to seeing everyone at this meeting on the 11th.  The things 
that we will discuss will be important for each and every one of you as you 
carry out your roles in 2001.  I hope that you will make every effort to 
attend.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a conflict that 
will keep you from attending the meeting.      




I hope that each one of you will arrange your schedules tomorrow to make the 
time to vote.  Also, please encourage everyone on your staff to take the time 
to vote tomorrow.   For those employees who typically work later hours, 
please suggest that they take the time to vote before coming to the office.  
Everyone should feel that they have sufficient time to make their vote 
count.  It should be interesting to watch the returns tomorrow evening.  
Hopefully, we will have all played a part in the outcome.  Congratulations on the birth of your daughter!  Meagan called this afternoon 
to tell me the news.  I will perhaps get more details when I get home 
tonight.  I hope that Laura and the baby are doing well.  Let us know what we 
can do to help.  I am sure that Jackson is a proud brother.  We will be 
anxious to meet our newest neighbor.  --Sally I will be out of town on January 19, so Brenda Herod has agreed to make the 
presentation for Rick Causey.  Please replace my name with hers for all 
communication regarding this Analyst Orientation.  Thanks.

Subject: January 11 - Managing Operational Risk

Please join me on Thursday, January 11 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm for a special 
information session for the Operations Management teams supporting Enron 
Americas, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets.   We will focus 
on assessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  Details on the 
location for the meeting will be sent to you early next week.  

I look forward to seeing everyone at this meeting on the 11th.  The things 
that we will discuss will be important for each and every one of you as you 
carry out your roles in 2001.  I hope that you will make every effort to 
attend.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a conflict that 
will keep you from attending the meeting.      




I just composed a somewhat lengthy e:mail about the anniversary trip, and 
then closed out Lotus Notes and checked discard changes.  So it is gone - but 
not sent!!  Can you e:mail me back your office phone number and if it is 
convenient for you, I will give you call and use old fashioned technology.  I know that you left a message with Patti about contacting David Eastlake.  I 
have sent e:mail messages to him that must have been delivered, as I did not 
get a message about undeliverable e:mail.  I haven't heard back from him.  
The phone numbers on the contact sheet are the students' numbers at school.  
I have left a voice mail both for Daniel Jenkins and David during the week 
between Christmas and New Year's, knowing that it was unlikely that they 
would be in Austin.  (It would be great to have their home numbers as better 
contact numbers during school breaks.)  I was on vacation the week before 
Christmas and for two days last week.  And I admit that I did not contact any 
students while I was on vacation!  I will try their Austin numbers this week 
again.  Although classes don't start until next week, they may come back to 
Austin early.  

Similar situation with my OU students.  I have conversed by e:mail since I 
did not have home numbers.  Do you know when classes resume at OU?  I will 
try my students there this week again by phone in case they are returning to 
school early.  

I had lunch with Ted Jacobs the week between Christmas and New Years - it was 
a thank you for finding some Orange Bowl tickets that David and I purchased.  
(Yes, we were at the game and saw OU win the national championship!)  I have 
an update from him on our list of OU candidates, according to his 
understanding of some of the decisions they have made.  If you have a few 
minutes today, give me a call and I can go over that with you. 

Since full-time offers were changed, did we appropriately change summer 
intern offers as well?  I didn't see anything in your e:mails about that.  
Let me know.  --Sally  Sheri has told me that you made an announcement recently.  Congratulations on 
the baby!  I hope that you are feeling well.  I am so happy for you and your 
husband.  My how your lives will change!!  But how enriched they will be.  
Our three are so much fun.  I will also always be honest with expectant moms 
and say that a new baby is an incredible amount of work as well and that it 
sometimes takes a while to really enjoy the experience.   If you ever want 
some funny stories about adjusting to being a first-time mom, just let me 
know.  I would be glad to share my experience with you.  --Sally Sounds good to me.

I will ask Patti to set up a meeting for us this week.  Your name has been on

Sally,

I'd like to get on your calendar for a brief meeting to discuss the 
organization change resulting from Scott's departure.  I have an idea if you 
have not finalized the new structure.  

I understand that Shona has some international experience and thought we 
could leverage that to our benefit.

One other item that needs to be addressed is our current location on 21.  I 
understand it is highly coveted by Tom Gros for expansion of the Commodity 
Logic team.  
Thank you.

Martha

I am sure that you are enjoying your break from school.  It is always great 
to have finals behind you and several weeks of vacation stretching in front 
of you. 

No doubt you are spending time thinking about your next step after 
graduation.  I would be glad to answer any questions that you may have about 
your offer while you are going through that process.  Enron had a fantastic 
year in 2000, and we are excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.  We 
hope that you will be a part of that. 

My number at work is 713-853-5926.  Please feel free to call me any time.  If 
it is more convenient for you to talk during the evening or on the weekend, 
my home number is 281-370-8568.  Don't hesitate to call.  

Sally Beck 
sally.beck@enron.comThanks for setting this up and for copying me on the schedule.  Hopefully, 
this will be fruitful for everyone.   And maybe unnecessary at some point in 
time!  Thanks.  -Sally

I think that four weeks is a good time frame for this - we can re-evaluate at 
the end of that period as to whether or not this is still needed.  As far as 
the right time, you should talk with Jeff Gossett (gas) and Scott Earnest 
(global products).  They can give you the best estimate on timing.  I am 
copying them on this memo. 

When your schedule is set, I assume that you will provide Jeff and Scott with 
a copy of the schedule (dates, names and contact numbers).  Please send me a 
copy as well.  This IT presence on the floor during critical calculation 
times will be very much appreciated.  I understand that not only will this 
provide immediate contact when and if system issues arise, but that your team 
will be working with the book administrators on improving spreadsheet 
macros.

Sally,

I am currently working on a plan for floor support to provide a better time 
coverage. I would like to hear your suggestion. I have been thinking of 
providing floor support till 8:00 p.m. every weekday for the next 4 weeks. Do 
you want us to extend the hours to later than 8:00 p.m. and longer than 4 
weeks?

I appreciate very much your comments.

Zhiyong







I hope that you are enjoying your break from school, and am sure that it is 
even more enjoyable with that Number 1 ranking decided!  My husband (an OU 
grad) and I were at Orange Bowl, and it was really exciting to be there and 
see the team absolutely stop FSU.  

If you have any questions regarding your job offer from Enron while you are 
on vacation, please give me a call.  2000 was a banner year for us at Enron, 
and we were excited about what we will accomplish in 2001.  I hope that you 
will join us and be a part of that.  

My office number is 713-853-5926.  If it is more convenient for you, feel 
free to call me at home as well.  That number is 281-370-8568.

Absolutely - Clara should have been included.  I asked for a list of managers 
and above within EGM from Chantelle, and used that for the distribution 
list.  Her list omitted Clara.  All lists that I requested from EGM, ENA and 
EIM were to have also included those being promoted to manager as a result of 
our year-end PRC process.  I don't think that I got consistent info from 
everyone, so I am rechecking names right now and will send Clara a message 
about the meeting as I also clean up any others that were left off of lists.  
Thanks for catching this.  --Sally

will keep you from attending the meeting.      



I would like to invite each of you to participate in a brainstorming session 
with me on Friday, January 12 from 8:30 am through lunch.  The purpose of 
this meeting will be to surface and capture ideas around the potential 
commercialization of mid and back office services that we provide.  I know 
that many of you have ideas about services and/or products that could be 
marketed and some of you have been involved in arrangements where we have or 
are currently providing services to outside parties.  While there are efforts 
underway with certain modules under CommodityLogic, I want this session to be 
used to take a broader look at how we might market mid and back office 
services.  I hope that you will be able to attend.  

Details on location of the meeting and more exact timing will be sent to you 
on Monday when Patti returns from vacation.   I was just thinking about the anniversary thing, too.  I bought a book at 
Barnes & Noble -- 100 Best Family Resorts in North America.  I found the name 
of one place that I have seen in the past in magazines that I always thought 
looked good - High Hampton Inn and Country Club in North Carolina.  Another 
place that I have seen is something like Blackberry Farm in Tennessee.  Both 
meet the criteria of mountains in the Carolina/Tennessee range.  I will get 
info on both and we can look at it.  I worry a little bit about having such a 
range of ages that I want to make sure that we go someplace where there is 
plenty to do for all -- just sitting for some, shopping, eating, golf, etc.  
These two places may be on the smaller side and may or may not offer enough 
variety.  I thought that I would also get some info on some other places that 
may not have popped up on Mom and Dad's list but that might be good for the 
whole family.  One of those might catch their interest as well. 

I can understand that with prolonged holiday exposure to Mom and Dad that the 
thought of this trip could wear thin.  I would like the opportunity to be 
together with everyone -- maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the 
two of them and the rest of us could have fun one night!  Even though Dad is 
doing so much better, you never know when you will have the chance to get 
everyone together on a trip like this.  Memory-maker or nightmare -- could be 
a toss up, but maybe worth the try.  Let's share some research and see if 
there is any place that we could get excited about going.

Hi, Sally,

Am sure you are swamped having been gone for a while...was glad to see OU
won the game--figured that made it a better trip for you!

Now that we know Dad will be around, shall we rev up the anniversary
planning again--or should we blow it off and do some great present--maybe
just send them somewhere?  Maybe it is just the increased holiday time with
them but Mom and Dad are kind of getting on my nerves right now....am sure
it will pass....

9:00, so this change doesn't work for me.  Can we try 10:00 am on Thursday 
this week?  Thanks. --Sally

Brenda,

Sally has a on-going meeting Thursdays from 9:00 - 10:00 AM (Risk Systems mtg 
w/ Rick Buy, Philippe Bibi, Beth Perlman and others - I think it is to deal 
with all the systems problems we have been having lately).

I passed this information along to some of my direct reports for their 
thoughts, and truthfully didn't hear back from anyone and didn't follow up.  
Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by 
AA's Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who 
led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover 
gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study 
itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.  
Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the 
questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very 
useful.  

I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for 
passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the 
person that has contacted you.  Just let me know his/her name and number and 
I will follow through on that if you would like.  

Hope that your holidays was enjoyable and that the new year will be a good 
one for you.  --Sally

Sally,

I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request.
They renewed their request for Enron's participation.

What is your view on this? Do you think the benefits of knowing what's
going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the 
project.

My recommendation is to forget it.

Dear Vince,

Peter Nance and I wanted to follow-up our discussion of Enron's participation 
in our benchmarking study.  Have you discussed Enron's participation in the 
project with your colleagues?

Here is a small sample set of metrics that were taken from a comprehensive 
list of over 700 metrics.  The study group will decide which metrics to use.

With EEI's credibility and Teknecon's technical expertise, we intend to 
become the industry standard in benchmarking.  We would very much like to 
have Enron participate in the study.

I would be happy to set up another meeting with you and your colleagues with 
Peter Nance if you think that would be helpful.

Best regards,

I will be there at 8:40 on Monday -- not a word until then...I have been out of the office at the Orange Bowl game and have just returned 
within the last hour.  That probably would make next week better for me than 
this week.  Give me a call and we will set something up.  My number is

she will be able to set  up a meeting.  Thanks.

Patti delivered to Sharron's desk this week a copy of my 2000 
accomplishments.   You should find that when you return to the office.  Let 
me know if for some reason you do not have that copy, and I will have another 
delivered.  

Have a happy new year!  I will be at the Cotton Bowl watching Meagan's drill 
team perform - and also watching some of the game.  Thankfully, no emotional 
attachment to either team in that game!  I just hope that we don't freeze.  
--Sally I have completed internal feedback forms through the PEP system for Brent 
Price, Bob Hall and Peggy Hedstrom.  Those appeared to be the only names that 
you included for which you wanted my input.  Somehow, from Andrea's voice 
mail message last week, I had anticipated responding to more requests - I 
thought perhaps input in working with Wes within ENA or Melissa on SAP.  
Those weren't  on my list within the PEP system, so I just wanted you to know 
that I have responded to the three that were there.  If there was intent for 
me to respond to any others, they weren't accessible in the system. (Believe 
me, I am not asking for more - just wanted to be sure that what I saw in PEP 
as a request matched your expectations in terms of my response).  --Sally I have always worked right up until my due date.  There is a lot of waiting 
and somehow I thought that the time passed more quickly if I was in the 
office in my normal routine.  Meagan was due on Wednesday, May16.  I set my 
last date of work for Friday, May 11.  Mom came in that weekend for Mothers' 
Day ( you were with her, right?) and then we did stuff the next couple of 
days until Meagan was born.  With Amanda, I owned the shop at the time and I 
was probably in the shop the morning of the day she was born.  She was a week 
late, so we just didn't know what to expect.  Tyler's due date was December 
18, and I set my last day of work for the Friday before that date.  Of 
course, then he was late, but we were in the throws of remodeling, so I was 
out picking out carpet and paint in those final days.  A lot of this probably 
depends on how tired you are and whether or not you feel like you have 
everything at the house ready.  I still had a lot of energy at the end of my 
pregnancies and I had also managed to get rooms ready early, so I enjoyed 
working as long as I could.  

Definitely make a point of you and Chris going to some movies at the theater 
before the baby comes.  You won't be able to do that for quite a while 
afterwards!!

I saw Kim's response to Stephen Douglas, but it left me short of comfort on a 
completion timeline or enough details around assurance on an on-going basis 
that this will be kept up.  I sent the note below to Kim.  I am sure that she 
manages well, but I think that we should encourage her to step into full 
responsibility and to be able to effectively communicate that within the 
organization.   It is likely that when Stephen reads her note, that he will 
call me and tell me that he still doesn't know when this task will be 
completed.  That was his concern yesterday, and Kim's note really doesn't 
address that.  If she doesn't have an estimated completion date, then she 
should set a target date for having all of the info compiled and state that 
at that date she will be able to create a realistic timeline for completing 
the task.  

Kim must own and communicate effectively the solutions, or I will be the one 
that gets the phone calls.  The ENA organization must develop confidence in 
others on our team.  Let's help Kim earn that confidence by coaching her to 
imagine the info that the customers needs (Stephen) and to clearly 
communicate information that addresses his needs.   Thanks.

Kim, do you have an estimated completion date for the commodities where the 
notation is that information is being compiled?  My guess would be that the 
one commodity that is up-to-date (financial power) is the one with the lowest 
number of transactions.  That means that the lion's share of the work is 
still to be done.  Are we staffed to get this completed in a timely manner?  
As I mentioned to you before, I would not hesitate enlisting Jeff Sorenson to 
do much of catch up work if we are short on people to get this done 
promptly.  Let me know if you need his help, and I will visit with Brent 
Price.  I know that Brent would support Jeff's involvement to get this caught 
up.  

Who specifically will be responsible on an on-going basis to handle the RMT 
Confirmations?   Will we have some sort of report that we can send to Stephen 
each month that will indicate the completion of this task so that he is 
comfortable on an on-going basis that this is being kept up-to-date?  --Sally

As a follow-up to my earlier voicemail message, the status of the RMT 
Confirmation Project is as follows:

Financial Gas:           RMT Confirmations complete through December 1999
   Bob Bowen is working on compiling the data for 2000
Financial Power:      RMT Confirmations complete through November 2000
Financial Weather

Financial FX:                       Laurel Adams is assessing the work to 
compile the data for 1999 and 2000

From this point forward, the RMT Confirmation will be prepared on a monthly 
basis for each commodity. 

As far as the Year End RMT Project, I spoke with Bob Bowen this morning as to 
the status.  What he told me was that he was supposed to receive a file 
containing the deal information of the deals involved.  This was per the 
meeting that he attended last week.  As of this morning he had not received 
anything He stated that he was expecting the file last week but never 
received any information.  He was going to follow-up with the appropriate 
individual.  I will give you an update in the morning to make sure that he 
has the data needed to complete the project.

Cindy Olson said you'd be a good person to talk with on this subject, as 
someone who has considerable experience with this concept.
I'm doing some research on the ASE and whether to create something internally

and which would be the aspects we'd discard.?
Can I get 15-30 minutes of your time to discuss in the next week or two?

I am meeting with Shona tomorrow to review the scheduling of doorstep reviews 
for the first quarter.  As long as the New York review isn't the week of 
January 15th, then I think I will still target that week for a London trip.  
Don't feel as if you have to clear the whole week for me  - I know that you 
are very busy, so I expect that we will work in time together around critical 
things that you need to handle.  I will try to send you a list of topics that 
I would like to cover by the end of the day tomorrow to give us a starting 
point.  You may have some suggestions on others that I should meet with while 
I am there.  Thanks.  --Sally

As to your visit

I will try to clear the week - the only potential curveball is my desire to 
be in NY when we do the NY doorstep( timing is uncertain ). I want to hammer 
home the need for absolute clarity re the remote office control structure and 
to review the SAP implementation work - both should be in place .

I will put together a list of issues/subjects that I would like to update you 
on over the next day or so  - we should be able to use that as a working 
agenda and a start point for scheduling time.

If there is anything else you would like to review specifically, I will get 
the necessary preparation done.

Cheers and Happy New Year

Subject: Holiday Wrap Up and January Plans

Hope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for 
shopping were fruitful.  I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but 
certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, 
volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very 
good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is 
nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those 
Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!  

I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of 
January 15.  I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through 
Thursday in the office there.  I have blocked those days on my calendar and 
Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.  How 
does that work with your schedule?  Will you be in the office that week and 
what is your schedule like?  I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time 
during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if  you 
don't have some time available.  Let me know, and then we can firm up 
discussions topics and agendas.  (My thought on that particular week is that 
it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the 
office during the week of January 22 and thereafter to communicate bonus 
information.)  

I am in the office all of this week.  --Sally

The items noted look like a good start to earlier detection of issues that 
may require reruns of valuation.  Thanks for marshalling the right resources 
to make this happen.  I will look forward to seeing your process timelines 
for current, iterim and target final state.  If my trip to London in 
mid-January works for your schedule, maybe this is something that we could go

In response to the below, there was a short planning meeting between 
Commercial Support and IT, specific objectives were identified which would 
enhance the DPR and reporting process, and improve the robustness of our 
processes, the following has been agreed in principle:

1. Commercial groups to input all trades and save out all curves by 6 PM GMT, 
pending agreement from the Office of the Chair.
2. IT to investigate/develop a report showing valuation of new trades, to be 
signed off by risk management before end of day.
3. Full valuation to start at approximately 7 PM GMT.  On completion, a 
comparison of the portfolio valuation will be made to the prior day's 
portfolio valuation and any material (threshold to be specified) movements to 
be reported to risk management ( for consideration of rerun )
4. IT Operations to monitor valuation for software and hardware errors, to be 
reported to technical support in the event of a failure.  

The benefits of this process will be to trap problems early and allow time 
for completion of the rerun of the valuation systems prior to the beginning 
of the next trading day.

Early in the new year we will produce daily process timelines for each 
business area/valuation system for the following:
a) current state
b) proposed interim state without automated trade capture/booking
c) target final state including automated trade capture/booking ( note - 
Market Tracker for UK Power business is currently in system test - 
implementation timelines for other businesses not yet available )

Upon completion of these analyses we will circulate and request full 
commercial signoff

Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out

The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment 
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability 
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and 
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting 
this change

The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any 
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver 
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks 
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in 
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of 
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we 
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve 
input validation processes on trade date.

Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to 
deliver

Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy 
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline ( 
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline ( 
Houston 11AM )

James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible 
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in 
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of 
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in 
delivering a trade date control process.

I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we 
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control. 
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.

Regards

Mike

Rick,

Thanks you for your note below. We are today implementing a flash P&L 
process. We aim to report daily numbers at 7am Houston time and will start 
today with the P&L. We will build on this and hope to have draft positions 
and VAR for most books within a week or so. There will be a reconciliation of 
flash to final numbers which will be included in our return to Houston. 
 
I will put together a note on the London DPR production process which goes 
into the process we currently have, the process we actually need to have, and 
the obstacles that are in the way. I would expect this to be finalised 
tomorrow. Obtaining the USD interest rate curve on a more timely basis is 
just one of our problems but it is unfortunately by no means our only or most 
serious problem.

James

Need your help on the following: Each day we are delayed in finalising var, 
p&L and positions because the UK must wait for a USD  interest rate curves 
before submitting their data to Houston. I am also told that it is really not 
necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of 
business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it 
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the 
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys 
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

Hope that Christmas with your family was fun and that your days off for 
shopping were fruitful.  I enjoyed my week off before Christmas, but 
certainly felt as if I worked very hard -- shopping, wrapping, baking, 
volunteering, birthday party for Tyler on the 22nd (3 years old - not very 
good planning to throw that into the mix each Christmas season), etc.   It is 
nice to be back in the office this week, although I still have all of those 
Christmas decorations to put away sometime soon!  

I have tentatively planned a trip to the London office during the week of 
January 15.  I will fly over on Sunday, so that I would have Monday through 
Thursday in the office there.  I have blocked those days on my calendar and 
Patti has made flight reservations for me just to hold that week open.  How 
does that work with your schedule?  Will you be in the office that week and 
what is your schedule like?  I certainly wouldn't occupy all of your time 
during that week, but I wouldn't want to make the trip that week if  you 
don't have some time available.  Let me know, and then we can firm up 
discussions topics and agendas.  (My thought on that particular week is that 
it gets us past year end closing issues and that I could be back in the 
office during the week of January 22 and thereafter to communicate bonus 
information.)  

I am in the office all of this week.  --Sally You should see this reply from Mike -- it is more positive than the response 
from James New.  Sounds as if they have not yet finished their document on 
required changes to processes, systems, commercial practices, etc. to move to 
a same day calculation of their books.  Mike and I have talked about this as 
a longer term goal for the London office and I knew that he was working with 
James and others to come up with a plan and a timeline.  I expect to review 
that with Mike when he has it in a draft form that warrants that discussion.  
That is why you haven't yet seen the document.  --Sally

Please see attached file for key contacts during weeks of December 18, 
December 25, & January 1.

Lexi:  In our meeting last week, I thought that we handled both Greg and 
Ryan, and were comfortable with Round 1 interviews only (2 interviewers) with 
this disposition:  Greg as a keeper (wasn't he the one who worked in the 
career center?) and no to Ryan.  

I will be glad to do a phone interview this week with

Unfortunately, I will miss your farewell at Slick Willie's on January 3rd.  I 
am sorry that I won't be able to drink a beer with you as a send off, but 
perhaps we can have one in London later in January as your welcome to 
London.  I will be in Miami on January 3rd, hopefully celebrating an Oklahoma 
win in the Orange Bowl earlier that day.  David found us tickets to the 
game.  Not great seats, but they are in the stadium.  Hey, it's not UT, but 
it should still be fun to go.  

I will miss you and your wit and constructive cynisism in Houston.  But I 
know that I can count on you to be just as vocal from London!  I plan to be 
there at least quarterly in 2001, and will definitely welcome your first hand 
observations on operational areas that may need attention.  Hopefully between 
e:mail and voice mail we can definitely keep in touch.  

Tell Ann that I hope that this will be a great adventure for her and the 
whole family.  I think that it is a wonderful time in your children's lives 
to give them this experience.    Have fun -- and set them straight!! Thanks for including me in the invitation to Slick Willie's.  Unfortunately, 
I will not be able to attend.  I will be at the Orange Bowl in Miami and will 
not return until the morning of the 4th.  We are making some progress with the timeliness of London information.  More 
to come...

you had an opportunity to address the need for European VaR numbers at the

Subject: Manual Wires

All,

We are shifting from SAP pay entity 0530 to 1021 on January 1, 2000.  As part 
of this process, we will be sending ALL MANUAL WIRES for GBP and EUR and all 
intercompany payments for the first week of January.  Corporate Treasury does 
not want to open new bank accounts, but we will need our existing accounts 
configured for company 0530 until December 2000 close.  Once December 2000 is 
closed, we will be back to sending payments though the system.

Mary Perkins has agreed that the Treasury group will accept all manual 
wires.  

We will do our best not to inundate you with wire requests throughout the 
day, but instead bring them in batches.    Thank you very much for your 
understanding and assistance!

If possible, could you please let me know via email or a phone call if you 
will be in Jan 2-5?  Thank you!

Tammie,

Sally is on vacation this week, therefore she will not be attending staff 
meeting.  She will be back in the office 12/27.

The following schedule has been distributed as noted regarding publishing the 
DPR over the next two weeks.  I know that books run in Calgary, Houston, and 
Portland will be calculated and officialized on Friday, December 22nd for 
trading that day.  The current plan is not to publish the DPR for December 
22nd on Tuesday, December 26th, but to wait until the first Enron official 
business day to do so (i.e. Wednesday, December 27th).  That will work as 
long as trading results for Friday, December 22nd are not dramatic.

Please leave a voice mail message after calcing the books on Friday, December 
22nd for Chris Abel (x33102) to give him trading results by commodity for 
December 22nd.  If there are dramatic results, Chris may produce a 
preliminary and rough DPR on Tuesday, December 26th with the information that 
you provide.  For locations that will not calc and officialize books on 
Friday, December 22nd, you will still need to contact Chris to give him your 
best estimate of trading results.

Thanks for your continuing help in providing timely and accurate information 
for the worldwide trading organization.  I hope that all of you enjoy your 
holidays.

All,

Please find attached what is now the latest and (subject to minor 
adjustments), the final version of the future Enron Metals North America 
organizational structure.

Effective November 1, the Montreal, Chicago and St Louis office's have been 
reconfigured into Agency offices.  I would like to thank all of you for your 
support and cooperation during this integration phase.  Clearly more work 
needs to be done but the major risk and control issues have been addressed.

Got your most recent message.  Your observation is correct that the Enron 
Americas staff member on Shawn's team has not been involved to date with 
Doorstep reviews or planning.  Although Shawn made an offer to Michelle some 
time ago, there was a long lead time for her arrival.  She did not start with 
the company until after Thanksgiving.  Since she started a couple of weeks 
ago, Wes and I have asked her to look into several specific findings from the 
most AA internal audit projects and to work with our staffs to provide some 
solutions to issues that were raised.  There simply has not been the time to 
date to expose her to Doorstep.  

After Shawn and I meet (see below), I will briefly summarize for you the 
roles that all groups will play in the Doorstep Review process.  Before we 
move forward I want to be sure that all parties agree on the purpose, 
methodology, participants and execution plan for this on-going project.

next week.  Thanks. --sally Great to hear from you.  I was thinking about you today.  I will look forward 
to your starting on the 29th.  Certainly if anything comes up with the move 
or the family, feel free to shift that date as needed.  I will be glad to 
have you as part of the team and think that we will have fun working 
together.  

I am on vacation next week (lots of shopping, wrapping, baking planned, plus 
Tyler's birthday party), and I am really looking forward to that.  I do feel 
as if I have been the PRC queen recently.  Wes' PRC last Thursday, mine on 
Friday, Enron Wholesale Services (minus Europe) with Mark Frevert on Monday 
of this week and a full day (7:30 am to 8:00 pm on Wednesday for the 
Associates PRC.  I do need a break!  

I will be working the week after Christmas.  Although we do have a holiday on 
December 26th, we will trading that day.  Lots of my logistics and risk guys 
will be in, so I will probably make an appearance that day.  I will be in for 
full days on the 27th -29th.  Very few commitments on the calendar for those 
days, so just let me know when you would like to get together.  

Hope that you, Frank and Lauren have a wonderful Christmas holiday.  --Sally

Subject: Catch up

Hi there  -- As I recall you are off next week, so wanted to touch base.  I 
am sure you will be ready  -- after PRC's and the craziness that has been 
going on over there.  

Just wanted to confirm my availability   and maybe see if we should get 
together while I am in Houston  (will be there between Christmas and New 
Year's) and could come in for a few hours or meet you for lunch.  

I think you said that you will be in London in early January - is that still 
happening?  Alternatively we could get together then.

Also -- I am planning to be ready to start work with you on Jan 29th  
(hopefully I can get Lauren into her school the week before - so she can get 
used to it).   We are leaving London on the 20th (AA signs of on our year end 
earnings release on Friday the 19th)  and then I will have a week to sort 
things out at home before starting!



I am really looking forward to learning something new, and working with you.  
Thanks for the opportunity.



If we don't speak before the holidays, I hope your family has a wonderful 
Christmas.

The Analyst/Associates Program plans to send the PRC reps a final listing of 
the PRC results by Tuesday, December 19th.  They asked that we not 
communicate results until after that date.  I did not write down all results 
from the meeting, so I would be glad to let you know, but would prefer to 
wait until I have written documentation of final results in front of me 
before doing so.  Both Remi and Don Black were able to add to my discussion 
around Erwin, so he was well respresented in the process.  I am scheduled to 
be out on vacation next week, but I will check e:mail messages from home and 
will get back with you via e:mail next week to let you know final results.   
Hope that you enjoy the holidays.  I will be back at work right after 
Christmas.  -Sally

I'm curious to know how did he do on Wednesday.  Any news?
Thanks.

FYI - Despite the fact that this an OU student, I thought that you would find 
this note interesting.  Since we compete with Big 5 for talent at several 
schools, we should be aware of the make up of some of their job offers that 
lure students to join them.    Paying for a masters degree at UVA ahead of 
time is certainly an interesting piece of this job offer.  See note from Lexi 
below.

Dear OU Team:

I just received notice from Jon Beck that he is declining our offer.  He has 
accepted with E&Y in Dallas.  They have offered to pay for his Master's of 
Accounting at the University of Virginia BEFORE he begins working for them.  
This is truly a wonderful opportunity for him, but I know how disappointed 
many of us are to see that he will not be joining the Enron team.

I didn't get back from the meeting with Causey and Buy until just before 6:00 
today - not that the meeting was long - Rick Causey was just running late so 
we cooled our heels outside his office for quite a while before getting 
started.  I decided that midnight would be outside the bounds of office 
dedication, so I did not call!  Enjoy your time off tomorrow and on Monday.  
My plans are to take off next week, and to be back in the office to work the 
week between Christmas and New Years.  I wouldn't recommend taking your time 
during your day off to call, but if you finish your Christmas shopping and do 
want to call, my calendar is free all afternoon after lunch tomorrow.  Wish I 
could send you with a shopping list for me!! Thanks for the heads up.  I will be here all day tomorrow.  --Sally

It is possible we will have a few late manual wires tomorrow.  SAP is 
shutting down early for a production build, and if we do not have all GBP or 
EUR payments confirmed by 4pm, we will have to create manual wires to make 
timely payments.  Thanks for your help.

I went by the store on my way home and saw a Pillsbury mix with red and green 
confetti in it - decided that cupcakes would be simpler than cookies.  Since 
it was after 10:00 when I got started on this project, it turned out be a 
good decision.  I would like your recipe so that when we are doing baking for 
the family next week that I can use it.

Enron Net Works has a 40 minute slot at the Management Conference.   I have 
roughly sketched out the following agenda:

Net Works Businesses  -  20 minutes (Greg/Louise)
The Fund - 10 minutes (Jeff McMahon)
Video - 10 minutes 

As a base for the presentation, please could you review (of course please 
write complete new ones if you want to) the slides incorporated in the 
presentation attached below (which was the last board presentation done by 
Greg) and send all updates to Jason by the end of play today.



Thanks

I left Mike a message telling him that I was forwarding this to you and that 
someone on your team would verify this information and get  back to him.  His 
note asks for info back by Friday the 17th - Friday is the 15th and I assume 
that is the deadline that he intends.  Thanks.  --Sally

Subject: New Counterparty

We have figured out why the credit group is getting so many "New 
Counterparty" names in gas.  The spreadsheets that they are getting that 
information from are for position purposes only on pipe-optons.  The value is 
captured in TAGG and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would 
be doublecounting credit risk.  The spreadsheet download has a specific 
download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name  (which in 
this case had to be put in as new counterparty.)  I am working with Debbie to 
figure out how we can download those positions without showing a counterparty 
at all from the spreadsheet.  It will be done as quickly as possible.

Thanks

Sally,

I wanted to send you a short note to tell you about the success of last 
nights Office of the Chairman Holiday Assistant's Party.

The party was an absolute success, but one of the main reasons why was 
because of Heather Choate.  I sent out ONE email to Patti and she recruited 
Heather who made huge efforts to get some wonderful gifts to be given out. 

It is nice to see people truly going above and beyond!  She was a superstar!

I was probably hopelessly stuck in traffic when we were to talk, and did not 
even realize that the time had passed. Construction on my route in to work is 
to continue until early January, and my alternate routes have proven to 
busts.  

I will call you tomorrow and see if I can catch you between issues.

Thanks for making the trip to Houston with your crew last week.  It was great 
to have people from so many different offices, supporting so many different 
commodities -- and yet with so many similar issues.  Your support for the 
interaction between offices is so valuable.  Thanks again for all of your 
efforts.  --Sally

Subject: NOV. 4TH SUPER SATURDAY INTERVIEWS

I am a recruiting co-ordinator with the Associate and Analyst Programs.  We 
are looking for additional offices within which to conduct interviews this 
Saturday, November 4th.  We are bringing in over 80 candidates and are in 
need of interview rooms.  Many of Enron's Executives and VPs recognize the 
importance of the success of this event and have lent their offices to us for 
these interviews.  However, many more offices are needed.  The interview 
process begins at approximately 9:00 a.m. and will conclude by 1:00 p.m. that 
Saturday.  If you are concerned about the sensitive nature of some of the 
materials in your office, we ask that you simply move the confidential 
documents to one side of your desk and/or credenza.  We will see that the 
materials are turned "face down" or covered with a blank piece of paper so as 
not to disturb their original state.  Unlike previous years, the Enron 
interviewers will be in the designated offices at all times with the 
candidates.   All offices will be locked after the completed interview 
process.  Please let me know the availability of your office for interviews 
at your earliest convenience.    We encourage your participation and 
appreciate your support.  

Did Debbie talk with the two of you before putting together her memo?  Is she 
raising this to me because she wasn't comfortable with the outcome of her 
conversations with you two, or did she skip that step?  Just curious, before 
I send any type of response.  I would need details from you around the 
process for updates to Entelligence and Global Counterparty.  Surely one 
feeds the other?  --Sally

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  "cleansing" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

By now you have received the packet for the WorkLife Executive Council 
Meeting scheduled for Monday, October 30, 2000.  The meeting will begin at 
2:00 p.m. - 3:30 p.m. in EB 42C1.  We appreciate your interest in the 
WorkLife Initiatives, we will be presenting to you.  Your input, comments and 
suggestions will be welcomed.  

We do regret that we were unable to schedule this meeting in a morning 
session for those outside of the Houston office and other requests that were 
suggested.  However, please be assured that every effort will be made for 
future meetings to be conducted in a morning session.

Look forward to seeing you at the meeting.



The week of November 13 is the week of the Enron Management Conference in San 
Antonio.  It begins on Wednesday evening, so most people will be travelling 
on Wednesday afternoon.  I will be in the office on Monday and Tuesday that 
week, so those days work well for me for your visit.   I just wanted you to 
know about the conference in case that has an impact on other meetings that 
you might want to have in Houston that week.  Let me know.  I will look 
forward to seeing you and introducing you to others on the team.  

We are looking forward to seeing Mo next week here in Houston.  

Have a great weekend.  --Sally

Subject: Houston trip

Hi there --- Had lunch with Mo today  -- so as you can imagine she was very 
interested in my new role, working with you.  Fernley has decided that it is 
too hard to write down all of the organizational changes and how it affects 
all of the people who reported in to Phillip and I, so he has just verbally 
announced the changes.  But, at any rate, the word is getting out.

I hadn't seen Mo in months, so it was good to catch up.  I think she is 
headed to Houston this week (so is Frank) so I am sure you will be hearing 
from her.


I have tentatively blocked out the week beginning Monday, Nov. 13th to come 
over to Houston, and would like to spend some of that time with you and your 
team, meeting people, and maybe just following you around for the day, as you 
suggested.

Does that week work for you?  I think the Management conference is later in 
the month, so people will generally be around.


Please let me know, and I will make sure it happens.  I will also need to 
spend some time with Melissa Becker and her team working on Post ASE 
Reporting solutions, but will plan to spend a significant amount of time with 
the North America group.


What do you think?  I am ready to get moving on some new things!!!!

October 30 and 31.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), will have 
telephone numbers where I can be reached.  I will have my cell phone with me 
(713-417-1591) and I will check messages as we have breaks in the interview 
schedule during the day.   I will be back in the office on Wednesday, 
November 1.  

In my absence, please contact the following persons regarding trading 
operations issues:

Gas Operations  Jeff Gossett  x37306
    Bob Hall  x36956
    Leslie Reeves x37962

Power Operations Stacey White x31870
    Leslie Reeves x37962

DPR    Shona Wilson x39123
    
MPR    David Maxwell x36983I think that four weeks is a good time frame for this - we can re-evaluate at 
the end of that period as to whether or not this is still needed.  As far as 
the right time, you should talk with Jeff Gossett (gas) and Scott Earnest 
(global products).  They can give you the best estimate on timing.  I am 
copying them on this memo. 

When your schedule is set, I assume that you will provide Jeff and Scott with 
a copy of the schedule (dates, names and contact numbers).  Please send me a 
copy as well.  This IT presence on the floor during critical calculation 
times will be very much appreciated.  I understand that not only will this 
provide immediate contact when and if system issues arise, but that your team 
will be working with the book administrators on improving spreadsheet 
macros.

Sally,

I am currently working on a plan for floor support to provide a better time 
coverage. I would like to hear your suggestion. I have been thinking of 
providing floor support till 8:00 p.m. every weekday for the next 4 weeks. Do 
you want us to extend the hours to later than 8:00 p.m. and longer than 4 
weeks?

I appreciate very much your comments.

Zhiyong

Thanks for your note.  I was great to meet you - I am glad that you could 
take the time out of the office to make the trip to Houston.  I will look 
forward to seeing you when I am next in London.  --Sally

I would just like to thank you both  for an extremely informative and 
constructive event. I learnt an lot from this and look forward to taking 
these ideas forward.

Thanks for the call.  Brenda Herod is the operations controller for EIM. 
(Brenda and Brent in their roles over EIM and EGM, respectively, are both 
direct reports of mine.)  Brenda is out of the country through the end of 
this week on vacation, touring Europe with her mom.  If there is a need to 
address this issue this week, let me know and I can start down that road 
until Brenda returns.  Let me know. 

I did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that Clickpaper.com is set to 
go live in London within 5 days.  I am trying to find out if that is true.   
If it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in Houston to do so 
this past July without letting anyone in the mid and back office know.  We 
had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.  
Not ideal.  I hope that history has not repeated itself.  Let me know if you 
have heard anything on this.  You got the right one -- thanks for telling me, but I already knew that 
without your having to tell me.  I cherish having sisters and love you very 
much too.  (Okay, maybe one of you is more cherished than the other, but 
don't tell Cara I said that!)

Would you ever be interested in helping us with recruiting at OU?  As you are 
probably aware, the analyst programs have been combined into one program, so 
we are searching for top candidates to bring in for all rotations within the 
analyst program.  Upcoming interviews are for summer interns.  We will be on 
campus on Monday, October 30 (just after the OU - Nebraska game).  Let me 
know if you are interested or if you have any questions, and we can get you 
formally added to the team that is recruiting at OU. 

Hope that all is going well in Chicago.  --Sally

Subject: OU Update

Dear OU Team:

I wanted to send a quick update regarding the rest of the fall recruiting 
season:

According to your recruiting guide, we are scheduled to host a Corporate View 
on October 19 and 20.  This has been changed to November 10.  This event will 
now be co-sponsored (in Houston) with Arthur Andersen and will also involve 
students from the Fellows group at Texas A&M.  We were given this opportunity 
through Tim Rasnic (our JC Penney Leadership contact at OU) and Dr. Tim 
Peterson (the contact for our Texas A&M recruiter).  Details will be sent to 
the group as Tim Rasnic finalizes the logistical details between the 2 groups.

Also, we will be conducting Intern Interviews October 30 and 31.  I realize 
this falls at a time when many of you are interested in being with your 
families (as would I), so please keep in mind that the greater number of 
interviewers we have for this event, the sooner we can all get back home to 
TRICK-OR-TREAT!!!  We will sort through the candidate resumes once I receive 
them from Career Services.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you will be able to help with 
interviews on day 1 (October 30).    
Just to update you on last week's interviews:
We will be inviting 9 candidates to Super Saturday on November 4.  I will 
send their names and contact information to you after each has been notified.

Thanks to each of you for making this season such a success!
I appreciate the time and help you have all provided!

thanks!

We can't wait to see the three of you.  Tammy and Tyler will be at home on 
Wednesday afternoon and will be expecting you whenever they see you.  Meagan 
has drill team practice after school until 4:45 and she drives herself home 
and Amanda rides the bus home after school, arriving about 4:30.  

Mo will be in Houston while you are here.  If it still works with your plans, 
I thought that I would take the day off on Friday, November 3 so that you, 
Paul, David and I could do something fun with Rebecca and Tyler.  The 
football game is that evening at 7:00.  I had also thought about arranging a 
lunch on Thursday (downtown - Irma's?) either for us with Mo, or even to 
expand that to include a bunch of ex-First City folks.  Mark Wilson, James 
Scribner, Chuch Randall and Charles Delacey all work here for Enron.  We 
could call MG Shetty, and with you and Mo and me, it would be quite a 
reunion.  Let me know if you would like to do either one of these two things 
and I will arrange whatever sounds good to you.

Hi Sally,

This is a note to confirm that we are still on our way.  We'll be at Lora
and Doug Bonser's house in Austin from Oct 27 to Nov 1.  Their number in
Austin is 512-892-0418.  We are planning on leaving early Wednesday morning
and driving via Brenham.  Will Tammy and Tyler be home in the afternoon?  If
not, we could hang out with my friends from Montana until people will be at
your house -- Pam and Rob Stephens -- bought a house about 1 mile from you.
(They lived in Texas last time we were there, moved back to Montana, and I
just found out that they are back in Texas for the long term -- small
world.)

I have directions that I got from the web to your house -- once I get in the
general area, I can find it.

See you soon!
Stephanie

Yes, you are nuts!  I can't believe that you already have so many gingerbread 
houses made.  The cookie exchange was fun - fudge is definitely the easy 
route on that one.  

I will get the recipe from home tonight and will e:mail it to you tomorrow.

Now to show that I really have gone nuts--I thought I would cook breakfast

it is fun....

Thanks!

I believe that all of you have met Frank (whose last name I can't remember), 
the HR generalist who is currently working with Hector to serve the HR needs 
for Energy Operations in ENA.   Frank is working on a contract basis at this

order to evaluate the duration of his work as a contractor and the 
feasibility of bringing him in as an employee.  I have given Sheila my 
feedback, but suggested to her that you may have had more contact with Frank 
than I have had.  Please take the time to send Sheila an e:mail message or 
voice mail to let her know what your experiences have been in working with

Subject: Agenda and Speaking Points for October 24 Engagement

Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller 
Forum that I am hosting next week.  There will be approximately 30 Enron 
business controllers present at the meeting.  All have responsibility for mid 
and back office operations for the following Enron entities:  Enron North 
America, Enron Europe, Enron South America, Enron Global Markets, Enron 
Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband Services and Enron Energy Services.  
Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, Sydney, London and New 
York (metals business).   

Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes 
before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to 
be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.  


You are scheduled to address the group as follows:

Date:  Tuesday, October 24, 2000
Time:  8:30 am
  (breakfast will be served at 8:00 and you are invited to join us)
Place:  The Warwick Hotel
  The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 
  5701 Main Street
  Houston,  TX  77005

The group would like to hear about Enron's performance, your outlook for the 
remainder of 2000 and into 2001, your viewpoint on the future of the company 
and next growth opportunities, etc.  With a small group, your talk can be 
informal and you do not need to prepare slides (unless you would like to do 
so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key speaking points that would enforce 
the value of this conference for this group would be:

recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 
2000 

the value you place on the jobs performed by operations controllers to ensure 
integrity in mid and back office functions

the importance of tight operational controls in enabling business growth for 
Enron (your loose/tight analogy would be great, as many have not heard that) 

the independent control role that we play and our responsibility to "raise 
the flag" on issues if needed

Very belated reply - I am cleaning up old e:mails today, and came across this 
one that I had not answered.  Commercial does not sign confirmations at this 
point.  Too many to make that practical these days.  When I started the 
confirm desk in 1994, traders were signing confirms at that time. Once they 
knew that they had someone who would take responsibility to make sure they 
were right, they were very glad to pass that responsibility to me.  In the 
early days of power, the traders once again were signing confirms.  Obviously 
interested in the details of every deal that was done.  But as the business 
grew, that too changed.  --Sally

Sally/Brent

Quick question - your confirms - are they signed by both Commercial & Comm 
Supp (as Attorney at Fact) - or by just one or the other?

I want to make sure EBS is consistent.

Currently - one of either Jim F or Paul R are signing all of them - rightly 
so at the moement - not many deals and they want to see all.

Thoughts?

Subject: Speaking Engagement - October 23, 2000

Thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the Global Operations Controller 
Forum.  I know that we are catching you before a tee time on Monday, so I 
especially appreciate your joining us to kick off the event that morning.  
Dress for the forum is casual, so feel free to do the same.  There will be 
approximately 30 Enron business controllers present at the meeting.  All have 
responsibility for mid and back office operations for the following Enron 
entities:  Enron North America, Enron Europe, Enron South America, Enron 
Global Markets, Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Broadband Services and Enron 
Energy Services.  Attendees will be here from Houston, Calgary, Tokyo, 
Sydney, London and New York (metals business).   

Attached for your reference is the agenda. There may be some slight changes 
before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to 
be covered and the other speakers who will address the group.  


You are scheduled to address the group as follows:

Date:  Monday, October 23, 2000
Time:  8:00 am
  (breakfast will be served at 7:30 and you are invited to join us)
Place:  The Warwick Hotel
  The Versailles Room - 12th Floor 
  5701 Main Street
  Houston,  TX  77005

With a small group, your talk can be informal and you do not need to prepare 
slides (unless you would like to do so).  Q&A afterwards would be great.  Key 
speaking points that would enforce the value of this conference for this 
group would be:

recognition of a job well done in supporting explosive business growth in 
2000 
your support for global standards for operational controls for trading 
activities
your recognition of the value of operational professionals in the 
organization to ensure integrity of mid and back office functions  
your challenge to the group to strive for best in class processes and 
controls as Enron's growth as a trading organization continues

Let me know if you have any questions and thanks again for joining us.  

        
FYI - my details to Philippe

the value you place on the jobs performed by operations controllers to ensure 
integrity in mid and back office functions

the importance of tight operational controls in enabling business growth for 
Enron (your loose/tight analogy would be great, as many have not heard that) 

the independent control role that we play and our responsibility to "raise 
the flag" on issues if needed 

        As promised, although a little later than expected, a draft agenda is 
attached at the end of my memo to Mike.  The memo will walk you through the 
agenda.  Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.  Again, 
I an sorry that you will not be able to join us, but I am pleased that so 
many others from the London office will be in attendance.  --Sally

Subject: Draft Agenda


Attached is a draft agenda for your review and comments.  As speakers were 
confirmed, the placement of certain items on the agenda were dictated by the 
speakers' schedules and then logical grouping of topics around those 
speakers.  Sunday evening will not be heavy - simple welcome and intros, 
drink and dinner - I know that many will be tired from traveling.  We have 
arranged for a private showing of the movie Rogue Trader (complete with comfy 
chairs and popcorn) which I thought could be fun for the group to see as a 
means of setting the stage for our discussions on Monday and Tuesday.  This 
can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.  

The morning on Monday will set the stage:  why we have gathered, endorsement 
of our efforts (Causey).  Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short 
"state of the union of operations" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and 
EEL).  Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold, 
discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.  

Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in 
which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of 
operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could 
have such an impact.  Each table can report back as we gather to start the 
afternoon.  

Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move 
Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and 
lessons learned.  Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going 
project.  

Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool 
for the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group.  

We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its 
impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted 
Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.  

Monday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles 
Center Field Terrace.  Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are 
waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.  

Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.  
He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.  He will make an informal 
presentation and then will entertain questions.  The rest of the morning will 
be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action 
steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information 
provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office 
services within Enron.  

Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic.  
Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group.  
After lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to 
reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against 
our designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).  

Please call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions.  The only details still 
in flux are Tom Gros' availability and confirmation of Philippe's 
attendance.  


FYI - would love to have your comments or suggestions

 On the 12/11 MPR to be issued on 12/12, we will be taking a $56 million loss 
on Catalytica Energy Systems.  This asset will begin trading on the open 
market either Friday, 12/15 or Monday, 12/18 under the ticker CESIV.  The 
potential trading range of $10 - $20 per share is disclosed in the company's 
S-1.  This asset is in Raptor I and therefore this write-down will exhaust 
$56 M of the remaining Raptor I capacity.

Enron Networks) along with Tom Gros.  This is in addition to my role within 
ENA.  As a new lead over the group, it is important for me to join the team 
for their team building next Wednesday.  

Let me know whether or not you have enough takers for dinner in Austin next 
week.  If you are short, let me know and I will see what I can do on another 
night that week.  --Sally Thanks for the names and numbers.  I have just called and talked with 
Jonathan Beck and Jenia Nikolova; have left voice mail messages of 
congratulations for Jeremy Fitzpatrick, Matthew Olney, David Scott, Corrinn 
Sutton, and Thomas Underwood; and left a message with a roommate for Ryan 
White.  I did not get an answer of any kind when I tried Thomas Lowell's 
number.  He is the only one that I have not contacted at this point.  I will 
try his number again before I leave tonight.  --Sally

Subject: OU Super Saturday Candidates

Dear OU Team Members and Interviewers:

Thank you for your time and help this recruiting season.  While there is 
still much to do, we are now to the point where we will soon begin to reap 
rewards!

After last week's interview process, we have selected 9 candidates to invite 
to the November 4th Super Saturday.

Those candidates are:
1. Jonathan Beck (405/579-8594)
2. Jeremy Fitzpatrick (405/447-6144)
3. Thomas Lowell (405/573-1103)
4. Jenia Nikolova (405/325-9435)
5. Matthew Olney (405/360-0311)
6. David Scott (405/812-5538)
7. Corrinn Sutton (405/292-7881)
8. Thomas Underwood (405/292-1108)
9. Ryan White (405/292-1470)

I personally called each candidate today to invite them to Super Saturday.  
Their formal letters will be sent later in the week.

Our next step will be to cultivate these candidates.  I will be assigning a 
candidate to selected team members next week for cultivation calls.  In the 
mean time, please feel free to call and congratulate them (just please let me 
know who you call so no one is left out!)

Thanks again for your dedication!

I am open from 3:00 to 4:00 on Thursday - have to meet with Enron's legal 
counsel from Sydney at 4:00, followed by a 4:30 meeting with Delainey on a 
proposed asset sale.   I have rescheduled my meeting with the Sydney guy  
several times this week, and I think this may be my last shot of meeting with 
him during this trip.  Is an hour sufficient?  --Sally

What is the latest on this one?  I gather that they are still using

Subject: Re: EnPower production - Argentina Power  

Shona,
When we returned from Argentina we concluded that a proper risk management 
system needed to be implemented in order to posture the office for success. 
They have been trading there for over 2 years which is plenty of time to do 
so.  We used Enpower as a phrase meaning "Proper Risk System".  If there are 
real questions about the functionality of such, then that obviously begs the 
question as to why we allow someone to transact on behalf of Enron 7500 miles 
away that doesn't understand.  That being said Mike Guerrero seems perfectly 
hip to having the best platform available.  It was Enron NetWorks that said 
that they could implement a "controlled spreadsheet environment" that would 
have ALL the functionality of a proper risk system, including risk 
aggregation into RisktRAC, credit aggregation and tracking, option valuation, 
scalability, security and stability. I will not opine on such matters.  They 
must produce or stop transacting.

I believe they have implemented a secure spreadsheet environment in which to 
work.  I know I discussed this during a meeting with Ted and Donna a few 
months ago and we decided we could live with the change to a secure 
environment in lieu of a full EnPower implementation.  Although EnPower would 
be great to have, if commercial decides that the office does not have the 
transaction volume there is not much we can do.  

As I understand it, there are further issues with capturing the appropriate 
curve shift info from these offices in RiskTrac.  Let's discuss what we can 
do and what decisions need to be made.

Thanks

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.

Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel 
knowledge to come up with a different solution.  Everyone will have to 
regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines.

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Steve

Subject: UT Super Saturday Candidates

Dear UT Team:

Thank you for all your time and help over the past several weeks.  Through 
the interview process, we have chosen 38 Financial Analyst candidates to 
bring to Super Saturday on November 4.  These candidates are:

Amanda Ostrander, Ali Ahmed, Bonnie Chang, Brad Morgan, Brad Staller, Brian 
Falik, Brian Kanatzar, Bryan Willingham, Carol Stauch, Castlen Moore, Doug 
Epperson, Chris Calato, Daniel Bates, Daniel Jenkins, David Eastlake, David 
Michels, Hina Khan, Irfan Iqbal, James Lee, Jason Huang, Jay Raman, Judy 
Maledon, Max Sell, Michael Morris, Natalie Madi, Natascha Seume, Paul Horng, 
Ryan Ruebsahm, Ryan Williams, Sean Steele, Shaleen Miller, Stephen Dexter,
Tayyab Balagamwala, Ty Purdy, Lydia Kuo, Matt Linford, Lauren Szeto, and 
Melanie Sandoval.

I have personally called each of the 38 candidates to let them know they have 
been selected.  They will also receive a formal letter through the mail later 
this week.  This letter will include details regarding November 4.

The interviews for the Tax Analyst position also yielded the following:
5 Spring Internship offers:  Ashley Berger, Yi (Zoe) Zhou, Li Li, Weijing 
Shin, and Xuemei Lang
1 Summer Internship offer: Chia-Lin Lee
2 Full Time Office Visits: Andrew Susman and Amanda Ostrander

The next step is cultivation.  I will assign candidates to targeted team 
members for telephone follow-up calls.  I would also like to have volunteers 
to go to Austin next week to take these candidates to dinner.  Please let me 
know if and when you will be available so that I can begin planning.

Thanks again for all your help and hard work!!!

The 13th won't work for me, unfortunately.  Rick Causey is hosting an offsite 
meeting from Tuesday evening (Sept. 12) through Friday (Sept. 15).  If you 
were to arrive early enough on Tuesday, we could try to do the review before 
I catch the plane on Tuesday afternoon.  The only problem with that is that 
the VP/MD PRC is scheduled for September 11 and 12.  I don't know that the VP 
portion of the PRC will be completed on Monday, or that the results would be 
available to me on Tuesday even if the process is completed on Monday.  We 
have been asked to hold VP reviews until after the PRC process is completed.  

I will contact you as soon as I do have the results from the PRC and we will 
set up a specific time for the review, either in Houston or Calgary.  Seems 
like it would be a good time of year for me to head north!  --Sally

received a copy of the rankings from Charlene on Friday while I was on 
vacation.  I will be communicating the final rankings to each Associate's 
supervisor today.  It is your supervisor who will the one be to give you your 
performance review and the ranking.  In your case, I would guess that Jean 
and your new supervisor will have to work out which one (or both) will do 
your review.  --Sally

Sally,

I don't know whether you or Jean (or Paul?) should be doing the feedback 
meeting.  If you will be doing it, please respond with your earliest 
availability to conduct that meeting.  I am fairly open currently except for 
3pm-4pm Mon-Thurs.

The Associates PRC meeting has been rescheduled for Monday, July 24th at 9:00 
am.  I have also sent an e:mail message to the associates letting them know 
about the new date.  We have a new date - Monday, July 24th beginning at 9:00 am.  I will contact 
your supervisors after the PRC meeting to let them know the final results.  
Your supervisor will give your performance review and will be able to 
summarize the feedback received through the PEP system during the review.  

Thanks for providing your resumes.  I will feel more informed during the 
process.   Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled 
and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.  Both the morning 
Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the 
same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is 
apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to 
cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as 
soon as I know a rescheduled date.  

In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with 
most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, 
accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a 
meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to 
accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have 
provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as 
copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.  

With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of 
your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance 
specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to 
me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please 
e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you 
have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name 
and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in 
Houston.  My extension is 35926. 




Irfan was one of the UT students, not OU.  Just wanted to make sure that we 
have him on the right list.

Dear Ms. Beck,

I want to thank you for interviewing me for the analyst position last week.  
I enjoyed meeting you and learning about your work.  My enthusiasm for the 
position and my interest in working for Enron were strengthened as a result 
of the interview.

I believe that my background and experience fit nicely with the job 
requirements, and I am sure that I could make a significant contribution to 
the firm.  I have not heard back yet and would appreciate any information you 
can give.

Thank You,

Irfan Iqbal






Today's Enron-wide Associates PRC meeting has been cancelled.  It was 
scheduled to start at 1:30 today, following the Analysts PRC.  Apparently, 
the Analysts PRC is running long.  Since both meetings were scheduled for the 
same location and with Joe Sutton as the chair, the Associates PRC has been 
cancelled.  I do not yet have a rescheduled date.  I will let you know when I 
do.  I am also sending an e:mail message to the Associates that I am 
representing so that they will informed of the cancellation.  

Thanks for taking the time to meet or talk with me about the performance of 
your respective associate in preparation for the PRC.  Thanks for the note.  I had received a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor =

represent in the meeting as indicated on the attachment.  The Associates 
Program has provided me  with your name as the PRC supervisor of the 
associate as listed.  

 

Please provide me with the following by Friday, July 14:   

Associate's accomplishments for the first half of 2000 (prepared by the 
associate or summarized by you) 

Description of associate's current responsibilities/assignment (and any 
additional rotational assignments during this first six months of the year) 

Pre-ranking of the associate from your business unit PRC , or your suggestion 
on ranking if no business unit PRC process has been completed (Superior, 
Excellent, Strong, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or Issues) 

Any other information that you believe will be helpful in accurately 
representing the associate in the PRC process

Recommendation for promotion, if any 

I will receive a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor Feedback from the PEP 
system through the Associates Program.  

I will be on vacation until Monday, July 17.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, 
will be contacting you next week to ask if you would like to meet with me for 
a few minutes on Monday or Tuesday, July 17 and 18 (or phone call) to discuss 
your associate and his/her performance in more detail.  

Thanks for your attention to this.  If you are not the appropriate PRC 
supervisor for the associate listed on the attachment,  please reply by 
e:mail as soon as possible and my assistant will research where I should go 
next for this input.  






I don't think that John Jacobsen should be reviewed in London.  Pulp & paper 
is still an ENA group, even though we have John reporting to you.  I would 
not roll that up under Global Products as it exists today.  We did review him 
in our PRC.  For some reason, HR has confused the issue with the Pulp & Paper 
employees by putting them under Global Products rather than ENA, a step they 
took I believe without any outside direction.  Does this make sense to you?

Subject: Mid Year Review Info Needed

I need a one page summary for all of your employees before I leave for London 
on Monday, July 10th.  I need this summary and all customer feedback 
delivered to Sue as soon as possible for aggregation.

These are the items I need:

Employee Name

Title

Brief Job Description and Day to Day Responsibilities

Areas of Strengths with Specific Examples

Areas of Improvement with Detailed Strategy and Direction for necessary 
improvement

Accomplishments / Process Improvements Employee made, did, or was part of

What this employee Did / Did not do in the first six months that made your 
life Easier / Harder (Met / Exceeded / Did Not Exceed Expectations)

What you need from each employee in order to help you move your group forward


I really think this should be no greater than one page.  While I am familiar 
with most if not all of these employees, I DO NOT know all of the above 
criteria for everyone.  These are the types of issues I anticipate being 
raised at the larger PRC and I need to make sure that I can answer any 
question raised.

I will sit down with each one of you and discuss each employee page 
individually after the PRC.  I would like to use this page as the PRIMARY 
feedback form for us to deliver to each employee.  This should supplement the 
system feedback form that we have used in the past.  At that time, I plan to 
roll out a group strategy and what is going to be expected from you and your 
groups in order for all of us to accomplish the known goals and objectives of 
our business.  I anticipate having these meetings completed by the end of 
July with feedback beginning around August 1st and finished by August 31st.  
This will give us plenty of time to plan around any issues that arise, 
however I would encourage you to get the feedback completed as soon as 
possible.

Last but by no means least, I would like to thank each and everyone of you 
for all of your hardwork and dedication to our business.  We have had many 
achievements and accomplishments and have taken on many new challenges and 
opportunities.  This is a direct compliment to you and I wanted to say THANK 
YOU!

Have a GREAT Holiday Weekend!

Scott

working from home today, but I decided not to bother you there.  I will try 
to have Patti connect me with you during my commute on Tuesday morning.  I 
start with a 7:30 meeting (Houston time), so I should be in my car from 6:30 
to about 7:15. 

I let Nikki know about a rescheduled date from Rick's PRC last week.  I don't 
think that there had been any widespread communication about the new date of 
June 27.  Will you still plan to come to Houston next week?  I have scheduled 
dinner for us on Wednesday evening, assuming that you will still make the 
trip.  Just let me know.  Will you also be back for the meeting on June 27?  

Before you left for vacation I had tried to reach you regarding the MG 
acquisition.  That should make life fun for you!  I wanted to talk about 
resources and how I might be able to help in both the further due diligence 
efforts and longer term in the assimilation.  As in my voice mail, I believe 
that a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical, both from a 
controls perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they 
run their business.  It seems that might help jump start the plans around how 
best to assimilate the business.  I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson, 
as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already 
been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and 
in other locations.  Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell  who 
seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.   I don't know the 
names that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is 
unaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.  We can 
hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning.    Sorry this took so long...  Sally says put her on our Co #413, RC # 0813 for 
now.  Also, she would like Angelique's resume as soon as possible.  Sally is 
in Calgary but she asked me to fax it to her as soon as I get it, so tomorrow 
would be great.

Thanks for your help,

For the May 8th expanded staff meeting, I would like to include Kevin Heal 
(Lead, Logistics) and Dianne Seib (Sr. Specialist, Documentation) as well as 
Kathy Reeves who is currently my only direct report at the manager level.  
Kevin and Dianne provide a lot of leadership to their respective groups, and 
I think it would be very useful for them to hear what Beth has to say.  Do 
you think this will cause a problem given that you are restricting the 
Houston attendance?  Let me know your thoughts.

For the PRC meeting, I am currently planning to be in Houston June 15th and 
16th for the Global conference.  The best dates for me would be Tuesday, June 
13th or  Wednesday, June 14th, and I'll just come to Houston earlier than 
planned.  Let me know once you've finalized the date.

For the training, there are only three people in Energy Operations doing 
reviews.  The three are Kevin Heal, Kathy Reeves and me.  I don't know 
Norma's last name so would you mind forwarding this list to her.  I will talk 
to Dawn Doucet about the best way to coordinate the training.

Let me know if you have questions.


Hope your long weekend was a good one, uneventful on Monday, at least.  Got 
your message last Friday.  It seems as if Kristin is more and more interested 
in the EBS role, especially after her continuing discussions with Jim 
Fallon.  The timing of her trip to London is somewhat up in the air.  May be 
the end of this week, may be next week.  I think it will still be good for 
you and Kristin to talk in person.  Kristin and Todd are both very qualified 
and you would love working with both.  Kristin's established working 
relationship with Jim Fallon would definitely be a plus.  I don't want to 
lose both of them from ENA, however, at the same
 time.  So I would suggest that we make it an either or propostion.  

I got your message on housing/location in Houston.  I am headed out of the 
office soon for an offsite meeting hosted by ENA's Office of the Chairman.  I 
will call you on Friday when I am back in the office and talk through some 
options on housing.  Count on me for interviews at OU on Monday, October 30.  If possible, I would 
love to fly up on Monday morning, preserving my Sunday night at home.  The 
first flight from IAH to OKC arrives in OKC at 8:10 am.  I could easily be in 
Norman for a 9:00 am interview.  I can also stay for interviews on October 
31, with a target of catching a flight from OKC at 1:35 pm back to IAH (the 
next flight after that for leaves OKC at 4:36 and arrives at IAH at 5:56, 
putting me at my house around 7:00 - too late for the start of trick or 
treating with a 2 year old).  

I plan to have dinner on Monday night with Chris Hoyle, the student that Jody 
Crook believes is the top graduate from the business school this year.  I 
would like to get to know him since I did not interview him when I was at OU 
this last time.  

I have also forwarded your message on OU to Cary Carrabine in the Chicago 
office.  I will let you know what I hear back from him.  Consider Shona 
Wilson and Steve Venturatos as interviewers again if you are short on 10/30 & 
31.  
Finally, I have noted November 10 on my calendar for the management 
overview.  Keep me posted on details.  --Sally

Dear OU Team:

I wanted to send a quick update regarding the rest of the fall recruiting 
season:

According to your recruiting guide, we are scheduled to host a Corporate View 
on October 19 and 20.  This has been changed to November 10.  This event will 
now be co-sponsored (in Houston) with Arthur Andersen and will also involve 
students from the Fellows group at Texas A&M.  We were given this opportunity 
through Tim Rasnic (our JC Penney Leadership contact at OU) and Dr. Tim 
Peterson (the contact for our Texas A&M recruiter).  Details will be sent to 
the group as Tim Rasnic finalizes the logistical details between the 2 groups.

Also, we will be conducting Intern Interviews October 30 and 31.  I realize 
this falls at a time when many of you are interested in being with your 
families (as would I), so please keep in mind that the greater number of 
interviewers we have for this event, the sooner we can all get back home to 
TRICK-OR-TREAT!!!  We will sort through the candidate resumes once I receive 
them from Career Services.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you will be able to help with 
interviews on day 1 (October 30).    
Just to update you on last week's interviews:
We will be inviting 9 candidates to Super Saturday on November 4.  I will 
send their names and contact information to you after each has been notified.

Thanks to each of you for making this season such a success!
I appreciate the time and help you have all provided!

thanks!

We did talk about the creation of these new positions within gas support.  I 
have also discussed this at length with Brent, and agree that the shift of 
manager positions to front to back looks across each region (eliminating the 
OA and Deal Validation manager roles) makes sense.  Upon the recommendation 
of Susan and Brent, I am comfortable with appointing Jeff Gossett as the 
manager of the West region.

Subject: Reorganization/Promotion

We are in the process of reorganizing several functional groups within Gas 
Operations.  With this change, we want to promote Jeff Gossett to Manager 
effective May 1.  The following describes the reorganization and 
justification for the promotion.

The Risk Management, Operational Analysis, Transport Rates and Deal 
Validation groups will be realigned into four regional teams and managed by 
Business Controllers.  There will also be a centralized Controls group with 
2-3 individuals that will be managed by a different Business Controller.  
With this realignment, we are creating five new manager positions (four 
regional and one Controls) and eliminating the two manager positions for the 
Deal Validation and the Operational Analysis/Transport Rates groups.  The 
regional Business Controllers will be responsible for managing the day-to-day 
activities of their regional teams, including interacting with the Trading 
Desk Directors, and the Controls manager will work across the regional teams 
to ensure consistency and efficiency in our processes.

The new Controller positions will be filled as follows:

West - Jeff Gossett 
Central - Carrie Hollomon
East - Will Kelly (Senior Specialist)
Controls - Kathryn Cordes
Texas - TBD (Brenda Herod to hire)

We are promoting Jeff Gossett at this time due to the responsibilities he 
will be carrying in the Controller role in addition to his current 
responsibilities for the NGP&L and Benchmark functions.   

Will Kelly's performance will be evaluated during the next few months to 
determine if he will be the permanent Controller for the East region.  If he 
performs well in this role, mid-year promotion will be pursued.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I will follow-up next week to 
discuss a salary adjustment for Jeff Gossett.

Thanks,

Susan  



Approved.

Thanks for the Pappa's gift certicate.  For a woman who can't remember the

for the beautiful flower arrangement that has graced my desk for the past two

I hope that the Christmas holiday brings each of you the joy of the season -- 
and some rest, relaxation and time with family and friends.  Thanks for your 
enthusiasm in your role at Enron and for your continuing and tireless 
effort.  It is through working with each one of you that I find my job to be 
fun.  1999 was a year of outstanding accomplishments for Energy Operations - 
a direct result of your contributions.  I look forward to meeting new 
challenges in 2000 through continuing to work together.      Would you ever be interested in helping us with recruiting at OU?  As you are 
probably aware, the analyst programs have been combined into one program, so 
we are searching for top candidates to bring in for all rotations within the 
analyst program.  Upcoming interviews are for summer interns.  We will be on 
campus on Monday, October 30 (just after the OU - Nebraska game).  Let me 
know if you are interested or if you have any questions, and we can get you 
formally added to the team that is recruiting at OU. 

Hope that all is going well in Chicago.  --Sally

Dear Ms. Beck,

I want to thank you for interviewing me for the analyst position last week.  
I enjoyed meeting you and learning about your work.  My enthusiasm for the 
position and my interest in working for Enron were strengthened as a result 
of the interview.

I believe that my background and experience fit nicely with the job 
requirements, and I am sure that I could make a significant contribution to 
the firm.  I have not heard back yet and would appreciate any information you 
can give.

Thank You,

Irfan Iqbal

Subject: Doorstep Meeting

Sally,

Following our Doorstep meeting today, I am following up on your request that 
I forward to you the list of Portland transactions for which we still require 
documentation, e.g. invoices, SAP entries, etc.  For the Settlements testing 
only, we reduced the deal population from 23 to ten randomly-selected 
transactions, in order to facilitate the Settlement group's ability to 
complete both its monthly close obligations and our Doorstep request.  The 
deal selection is indicated in yellow, and the missing items, in green.




Also per your request, attached are the five "non-standard" deals for which 
we have been unable to obtain any information at all.  Our primary need is 
just to get a basic understanding of these transactions.

Colorado Springs Utilities  10/1/98-9/30/03 Colorado 50-150 MWs
BPA     10/1/01-12/31/05 NW Delivered 105 MWs
Welded Tube    1/1/98-6/30/05 PGE - NW 5.2-12MWs
British Columbia Power Exchange 1/1/98-1/1/15 COB 85-176 MWs
Harbor Cogen


Thank you for your help, Sally,
Ken




I have this on my calendar and I will be there.  Thanks. --Sally

Crazy week -- 7:00 pm and I just finished a project for Delainey that I got 
at noon today.  Cancelled everything on the calendar and have been immersed 
ever since.  Patti gave me your message with your home number around 5:30 
today, just as she was leaving -- apologized for not giving it to me 
earlier.  However, given my immediate project, I don't think that I could 
have called until now.  And at 1:00am London time, I think that this e:mail 
is much better.  

I am still really crunched tomorrow morning.  All of our mid-year reviews 
must be completed by the time we have our ENA Office of the Chair staff 
meeting at 2:30 tomorrow.  Big push, after an over percentage completion rate 
of about 60% at our ENA meeting two weeks ago.  Some of those unfinished 
reviews were mine to give (16 direct reports is a killer).  I wrote three 
last night after Tyler went to bed, finished at 1:00 am and gave all three 
reviews this morning.  I have 5 more to write tonight, and to deliver 
tomorrow morning to be at 100%.  I will try to call you on my way into the 
office tomorrow morning from the car.  If I miss you then, it will be late 
afternoon Houston time before I could call you.  Next week shapes up to be 
MUCH better.  

I am definitely very interested in continuing our conversations.  Would love 
to have to over here and involved in operations.  So I will either catch you 
from my car tomorrow morning, or we can talk on Monday.  In cleaning up e:mails, I ran across this one that I had not yet read.  Has 
James called and talke with you about Enpower?  Are his concerns in the memo 
accurate?  Let me know.  --Sally

Subject: Status update on the issues surrounding Continental Power 
volatilities and correlations

As you know for some time we have been trying to get the Continental Power 
traders to increase the volatilities they use for valuing their option 
portfolio and for use in calculating their VAR as it has been obvious that 
the market  has become more volatile but this was not being reflected in 
their mark.

In looking at the impacts of this, various other issues came to light. 
Firstly it raised issues over the correlation matrix used in the VAR model as 
this was way out of date. We have worked with Jitendra and have now put in a 
matrix that both the traders, risk and RAC are happy with. Secondly, as you 
may be aware, in Portcalc swaptions currently use the volatility input on the 
deal ticket and not off any volatility curve. 

The current portfolio is 90% swaptions and so this represents a serious issue 
for us in that it is not practical to manually change all the volatilities at 
the deal ticket level every time the implied voaltilities change. We cannot 
use the option functionality as this only values hourly or daily exercise 
options and not fixed expiry swaptions or options. We also have not found any 
way in Portcalc of valuing Asian options so we are having to 'force' in the 
few we have. We have had the Houston based Portcalc IT team work on a 'new' 
piece of swaption valuation code but currently it contains a number of 
worrying bugs. These are primarily that the proposed code does not take the 
correct underlying forward price and uses the volatility of (approximating) 
the last day of the underlying rather than the implied volatility of the  
underlying. 

They are currently being hampered in that they do not have any IT personnel 
who have sufficient option knowledge (I understand that the two most 
experienced coders resigned to go to another Houston based energy company). 
This is extremely worrying and I find it hard to believe that the whole of 
Enron's power business is having to use the methodology of inputting the 
volatility at the deal ticket level. This will almost certainly mean that 
different volatilities are being used in the VAR as are being used to value 
the swaption portfolio globally. As well as these issues we have concerns 
over the use and accuracy of the smile adjustment in Portcalc (worryingly it 
does not seem that you can 'switch' this off). Briefly it seems that Portcalc 
calculates the delta used to adjust the volatility by comparing the strike 
price to the forward price of the last day of the underlying rather than the 
forward price of the underlying itself. 

We have engaged London based  IT and are looking at the code we have used in 
Power 99 to se if there is a way we can get something done quickly to start 
to value all option products off a curve and to be able to book Asian options.

Once we get the above resolved we still have no way or extracting the vega or 
gamma risk from Portcalc in it's current state as the information is just no 
there (so we are told by IT). The system 'seems' (we cannot be 100% sure 
given all the other errors) to produce a vega and gamma P&L number but what 
the risk is remains a mystery. Again this is very worrying in that we have 
Power option traders all over the world who can't get their underlying vega 
or gamma risk position from the global valuation system. We are trying to 
work on something manual to draw a line in the sand but I would really like 
to know how the American based traders cope as they have this problem 
(knowingly or not)  for years. What sign offs were gained for the 
implementation of Enpower because it seems to us that using the current 
system it is not possible to comply with the Global Risk policy. How do we 
validate the inputs to the valuation if we do not know the risk ?

Despite the above we have now persuaded the traders to save out newer higher 
volatilities a week ago and you should have seen a large move up in their 
VAR. However, as it stands at the moment they are notable to save out a daily 
remark as Jitendra is saying that he is not happy with their 'model' / vol 
curve generator (I have today asked for a full explanation, details of any 
testing etc etc and time lines so we can move to getting over this hurdle). 
The swaptions have also not yet had the ticket volatility changed but the 
impacts are expected to be positive as we are long volatility.

I would appreciate your comments on the above as it seems that we are pushing 
the boundaries here on areas which we really expect to have already been 
covered in Houston some time ago and could do with some help. We are having 
to use a system which seems to us to have numerous bugs and short comings and 
are having to spend an enormous amount of IT time overcoming the inadequacies 
of Enpower wich I do not think most people are aware of. Consequently we have 
not been able to deliver all the improvements we were required to do in 
gaining the increased limits so 3 months ago but I would hope you agree that 
it is not for a lack of trying.

Sorry it's so long but if there are any questions or any perceived 
inaccuracies in any of the above then please let me know.

James


If HR can not find this signed review, can Clara communicate with someone in 
your group in Houston to be able to access a copy of the review by 11:00 am 
on Friday?  That is the deadline for the final tally on completed reviews 
(defined strictly by HR as their having received - and retained, I guess - 
the signed review).  The goal is 100% completion by then, for reporting in 
the ENA Office of the Chair staff meeting on Friday afternoon.  Although many 
employees are now not under the ENA umbrella, we are tracking the completion 
of reviews by their operating company assignment at the mid-year PRC time.  
Thanks.  

Of course, I believe you said that this guy left the company, and if that is 
the case we may be alright without the review.  But getting a second copy 
from Clara would probably be the best bet.  Thanks.

I scheduled this meeting in Houston to best accomodate schedules of some of 
our Enron speakers -- the hill country or even Galveston was going to make it 
impossible for Jeff Skilling to join us.  I would look at this meeting as if 
it were to be held outside of town.  I have preliminarily reserved rooms for 
all of you at the Wyndham Warwick.  Part of the reason for this forum is to 
meet and get to know your counterparts in other Enron operating companies and 
from around the world.  If you can stay at the hotel, this team building will 
probably be enhanced.  This memo is not to force you to pack your bags and 
stay at the hotel, but to let you know that my budget for the event did 
include rooms for all of you for Sunday and Monday nights.  I hate the Sunday 
thing, but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who 
will travel from far away, this best suited their schedules.  Please let 
Patti know on Thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to 
make it easier for you to fully participate.  I am forwarding a message from a Wellesley student which includes her 
resume.  Let's make sure that she is on our interview schedule for our return 
visit in November.  I talked with her quite a bit before the presentation, 
and was impressed with her.  She has followed up with phone calls and this 
e:mail.  I am sending her some additional information on Enron at her request 
to help familiarize her with the company.  Her work experience to date has 
been with more traditional energy companies. --Sally

We had a good meeting with James last week - I hope you have had the

Hector has still referred to the key players under Jeff Gossett as managers. 
However, only one of these (Will Kelly) is a manager.  The remainder are 
senior specialists.  Let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in 
detail.  We are potentially exposed for Steve Jackson to hire some of these 
players away.  Steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer, our 
competitor, which will require that he have good people.  He will be moving 
to Columbus, Ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire.  
He does know these risk specialists here, and being young and single or 
childless, their mobility factors could be high.  Enron would not want to 
lose any other talent to Steve's new employer.

Hector:  The key employees that Jeff has identified are senior specialists, 
with the exception of Will Kelly.  If you remember, these are the risk 
employees that I was concerned about when Steve Jackson tendered his letter 
of resignation.  Steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor, and 
it is not inconceivable that he might approach some Enron employees to join 
him and help ensure his success with his new employer.  We don't want this to 
happen.  Waiting until the end of November to implement an effective 
retention plan does not make sense.  Please call me tomorrow and let's talk

Hi Sally,

I want to thank you for interviewing with me last Thursday.  You made the
interview more relaxing and I enjoyed our conversation.  After speaking with
you and the other Enron people, I've become very interested in Enron.  I
would be thrilled to come work with you at Enron.

Sincerely,

Max Sell

Thanks, 
Patti x39106Hector:  The key employees that Jeff has identified are senior specialists, 
with the exception of Will Kelly.  If you remember, these are the risk 
employees that I was concerned about when Steve Jackson tendered his letter 
of resignation.  Steve will be taking a similar role with a competitor, and 
it is not inconceivable that he might approach some Enron employees to join 
him and help ensure his success with his new employer.  We don't want this to 
happen.  Waiting until the end of November to implement an effective 
retention plan does not make sense.  Please call me tomorrow and let's talk 
about how we can jump start this.  Thanks.  --Sally

Jeff, 
I spoke with Todd Burke regarding a retention strategy for the managers we 
talked about.   He told me that he would make a recommendation after he 
completes the pay practices survery by Mid-November in order to accurately 
compensate them.   He is concerned that we may present an inaccurate plan for 
retention without market data. 
If this is a very urgent issue for you please let us know.   If you suspect 
that the managers are being made offers then please let us know.

I am so glad that you will be able to attend.  I will have a fully developed 
draft agenda available within the next couple of days.  It may help to know 
that the plans for Sunday will start with a cocktail reception at 5:00 at the 
hotel, followed by dinner at the hotel at 7:00.  We hope to have Mark Frevert 
join us that night to informally address the group.  Sunday night will be 
low-key, as so many of you will have travelled a number of hours to get to 
Houston.  On Tuesday, the plan is to meet until mid-afternoon (3:00?), so 
that some of the London participants can fly back to London that evening.  I 
do believe that some will stay Tuesday night and will plan to have meetings 
in the Houston office on Wednesday.  If that is the case, I will also arrange 
a dinner for Tuesday night.  Hope that this helps!

Hi, Sally--am sure you are glad to be back from cold, dark, cruel Oklahoma!

We will need to drive over early Saturday.  Brigeda has an art lesson at 4pm
on Fridays so we wouldn't be able to hit the road until pretty late.

Found out this morning she has pneumonia--has had a cough I decided I should
check out--although she is not contagious and is staying in school...

Brigeda went shopping with your Gap card this weekend--she thought it was
just too cool.  She is very conservative with money so she shopped the sale
racks.  I stayed out of the selection process totally--certainly a sign of
things to come!  She picked out two jean skirts and two shirts--no doubt she
will wear them to your house--I believe that she is trying to look/dress
like Amanda.  (I did, however, dissuade her from buying the leather
pants--told her that would be way too sweaty!)

Looking forward to seeing you all on Saturday.  We'll plan to hit the road
by 9.

Cindy

It is with regret that I have accepted Steve Jackson's letter of resignation 
from Enron.  Steve has made a choice to leave Enron and to join another 
company in the industry.  I know that you will join me in thanking him for 
his many years of service to Enron and the contributions that he has made.  
His risk expertise and his knowledge of ENA transactions will be missed, as 
will his leadership on the gas team.  Although Steve's official last day with 
the company is in two weeks, today is his last day in the office.  He will be 
available by phone over the next two weeks if there are questions that you 
may have on any open items that you were covering with Steve.  Patti has his 
home number if you need that.  We will also plan a happy hour for Steve and 
we will let you know when and where that will take place.  

Effective tomorrow, Jeff Gossett will assume leadership of the gas risk 
group, reporting to me.  Jeff will join Bob Hall and Leslie Reeves as 
business controllers for Natural Gas, to continue to work together to provide 
leadership for the processes, controls, people and systems that support all 
aspects of this key business for North America.  Please join me in 
congratulating Jeff on his new responsibilities.   FYI...I will keep you posted.

Subject: Re: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns
  

Sally,

Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly 
to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as 
an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very 
happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that 
you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you 
offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that 
momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most 
don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I 
have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we 
wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to 
accomplish with their guidelines.

Please keep me up informed on this matter.

Thanks and good luck with the students.

Subject: Hiring Practices for Summer Interns


While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.

Controller forum set for October 22, 23 and 24.  I want to send the official 
invitation early next week.  I have conferred with Mike on attendees from 
EEL.   Since I do not know all of the reporting relationships in London, I 
did want to share this list with you and get your input as well before it is 
finalized.  Please let me know your thoughts on attendees per the attached.  

Mike was not sure that you would want to be included, but I certainly want to 
invite you and would very much welcome your attendance.  If you can come, I 
would be great for you to address the group if you would like to do so.  Just 
let me know.  Jeff Skilling, Rick Causey, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford are 
confirmed as speakers, and I am waiting to hear from Mark Frevert on his 
participation.  I expect to sent a preliminary agenda out for review next 
week as well, and would welcome your comments on that.

Please update the following items for Project Doorstep:

Observation:  Term transactions executed via EOL do not automatically bridge 
into the capture systems thus increasing the amount of transactions manually 
captured.

Status: The bridge from EOL to Sitara for term transactions was placed into 
production on September 21st.  This item is now completed.

For your information, we are planning to complete our Enpower testing today 
and are working with Houston to go into production tomorrow.  I will let you

Cindy Horn focusing on processes on procedures, specifically controls.

Please join me in supporting all of these people in their new roles and 
additional responsibilities.

4 counterparties for a total of $10.2MM makes me think that each one must be 
pretty large.  I am copying Leslie on this note, as I would like to know the 
names of the counterparties in the over 90 day bucket and how many dollars 
are associated with each one -- also how likely we think that collection is 
in each case.  

Leslie:  I know that it may be that reconciliation is not far enough along at 
this point to provide this kind of detail, but it is the type of question 
that Dave may ask.

Decisions, decisions ...they are tough for her.  I suppose that if she wants 
others to host the shower that we can just split the cost of a couple of 
packs of diaper pins and then focus on eating all the sandwiches and cake 
that we can!  (Do you think that we will be invited?)  That really sounds 
ugly, and I don't mean it to.  I think that your idea was a great one, but if 
she has too many offers we can probably just as easily be guests.  Let me 
know when the deliberation process is completed!  --Sally

Sally,

Let's reserve that last weekend.  Saturday would be fine with me.  You need
to know that I got an email from Cara--she's had a couple of offers for
showers--and is having a hard time deciding what to do (hmm...what a
surprise!).  Anyway, am not sure where our offer stands--we'll see.  I told
her to do whatever is best for her (while thinking:  if she doesn't choose
our shower invitation it will affect my gift!)

Will try to pin her down...

Cindy

Late Jan sounds great.  Meagan does have a couple of big things on the
weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation (big
dance that she and I are committed to help with), the Bearkadette Ball and
a winter party for Cotillion.  I believe that these are three weekends in a
row, January 6, 13 and 20th.  So the last weekend in January would work
well (and I will need a rest from formal affairs!).  Does that work for
you?  And do you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday?  Saturday probably
works better for me, just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by
Sunday afternoon!!

Should we set a date now?  Am I turning into Mother?

This memo apparently was already out on e:mail when we were meeting in my 
office regarding confirmations.  The language regarding Jeff's role on 
financial confirmations and settlements was left in the memo.  It wasn't  
clear to me when we met whether Scott and Leslie had talked while looking at 
a draft of the memo or whether she had seen this on e:mail.  Since you said 
that you had not seen this memo, please follow up with Scott, Leslie and Jeff 
to ensure a common understanding around financial confirmations and 
settlements so that can be communicated within the organization.  There 
should not be confusion over who has responsibility for financial confirms 
and settlements.  This memo as sent will create that confusion.  Thanks.

Thanks for sending the dates in writing.  We already have this on our home 
calendar and all five of us are looking forward to your visit.  I did confirm 
that there is a home football game on Friday, November 3, so if you all are 
interested in going, we will have plenty of tickets.  The weather should be 
great here then. 

I have also blocked off Friday, November 3 from work so that we can do 
something fun with the kids -- zoo, Children's Museum, etc. 

I sent Mo an e:mail message about your stay in Houston in hopes that she may 
need to be in Houston at that time.  I will let you know what I hear from 
her.

Hi Sally,

I am so excited to see you and your family.  For your written
records...we'll in be Austin from Oct 27- Oct 31.  Then, we'll travel to
Houston via the Blue Bell ice cream factory on Nov 1st -- our plane leaves
from Houston on Sat, Nov 4th about 12:30.  Doing something on Friday with
Rebecca and Tyler sounds great -- she's pretty much up for anything.

Let me know what you hear from Mo -- it would be wonderful to see her, too.
Paul and I were starting to worry that something bad had happened in her
life!  It has been so long since we have talked to her.

This week's issue of Business Week has Enron in a list of the top 50
companies who are making the Internet work for them in running their
business  -- the focus for Enron was on the different trading operations,
highlighting trading broadband capacity.  I read BW weekly and Enron seems
to be in there a lot.

Take Care,
Stephanie

Is this a timeline for all of ENA, or just for the accounting group?

Hope are things in London?  I have seen Beth Apollo at two meetings in Texas 
recently, one in Dallas and one in San Antonio.  We have been making the 
Texas circuit -- not quite as exciting as your travels.  

I have heard from Stephanie, and she, Paul and Rebecca are headed to Texas at 
the end of October/beginning of November.  She will be interviewing students 
at UT on October 30 and 31 and then she and her family will be in Houston 
from Wesneday, November 1 to Saturday, November 4.  They will be staying with 
us at our house.  It will be fun to watch Tyler and Rebecca get to know one 
another!  She is an older woman, but I am sure that they do well.  By the 
way, Stephanie is expecting baby number two -- I think that when she is here 
she will be about six months pregnant.  

I thought that I would let you know what her travel plans are on the off 
chance that you might be in Houston at that time.  It would be fun for all of 
us to get together.  I don't know if I had told you, but Chuck Randall has 
joined Enron and this week I saw another old First City banker, Jeff Baker, 
who was on his first day here.  We could also schedule a First City reunion 
if you could be here.  If it doesn't work this time, just let me know the 
next time you will be in Houston and I will round up all the usual suspects 
for a lunch or happy hour.  

I may need to head to London in October or November.  I will let you know if 
my travel plans develop.  

I hear from Beth that you have taken a very adventurous vacation -- mountain 
climbing!!!!!!!  How was it?  I will be anxious to hear.  --Sally  
I read your note back to Shona, and I understand John's desire to put a 
reminder in front of people, including commerical staff members, about the 
need for operating standards.  If this is the best time to put that in 
writing for Europe, then by all means go forward with that.  If there is an 
efficient way to reference this effort as an Enron-wide initiative to define 
and monitor these standards across all locations and all commodities traded, 
then that would be great.  It simply helps put the London initiative in the 
context of an Enron-wide effort that we all feel is important.  --Sally

Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts 
on the cover note ?  

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message ( it is a European note )and the means of delivery.  On 
the means of delivery, I am not sure from your note whether or not I fully 
understand the intent.  Is there an article to be included in an Enron 
publication ( yes )and in addition a letter to be sent under John's name (if 
so, to whom will the letter be sent)?  Or is the letter from John an 
introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?  ( Yes - apologies 
if there is confusion )

With regard to a global message , I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  
Agreed - but the note was targeted at Europe - would welcome the opportunity 
to work on this with you and Shona )

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  Can we discuss this - please see separate note from me to 
Shona

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally  - Certainly not  - and thanks

Fernley  / Sally

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
summary ).

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
Enron Europe newsletter )

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

Subject: timing of submitting information to Risk Controls

Over the past few weeks, we have not been receiving information from the risk 
management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our 
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.

Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):

7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 
8am meeting)
7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos
2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos

In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to 
meet the following deadlines (Houston time):

before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure 
information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)
4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT
7:20 (all): export of preliminary information
7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos
11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for 
Merchant Asset group)
12:00 (Houston only): export of final information
 
Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.  
Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go 
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the 
whole process.

Thank you,

Shona Wilson

Thanks for rounding up the tickets for the Orange Bowl.  You can mail them to 
me, or just hold them until I see you after Christmas.  Mike's wife decided 
not to make the trip, so he won't be using the tickets.  Jody Crook will use 
the other two tickets.  

Lunch during the week between Christmas and New Years sounds great to me.  I 
will be working that week, but would be glad to meet you guys at Champions 
for lunch if that is best.  Or if you are game for Irma's, just let me know 
when you would like to come downtown.

Subject: Lunch??


Sally/Mike,

I will be in Houston the week after Christmas (12/26-12/29) and was
wondering if the two of you were going to be in the office, and if so, would
you be available for lunch? In talking with David Beck, he was going to try
to arrange a golf game (Mike, me, Richard Kimberlin and David) one of those
afternoons at Champions. If that is possible, then maybe lunch before golf
might work. If not, then I can meet you downtown when convenient. Let me
know what your schedules are like and I will plan my schedule accordingly.

Also, I need to know if I need to mail the Orange Bowl tickets to both of
you separately or just one of you. Didn't know if you are planning on going
to Miami together? I should receive the tickets in the next day or two and
will do whatever. Ought to be a fun trip, as it has definitely been awhile
since the Sooners have been to Miami.

Anyway, let me know if you are available for lunch/gold or just lunch.

Hope you all have a wonderful holiday season and most of all get to spend
time with your families!

Fernley:  I think that you are right about easy access to the standards.  In 
fact, at the Global Operations Controllers gathering in Houston in October, 
we are going to roll out a website created for Global Risk Operations.  The 
global standards will be one of the items included, as well as contact lists 
for Operations Controllers worldwide, calendars for all Enron offices 
worldwide, a "what time is it there if I am here" page, etc.  I would like 
for this to be introduced at the offsite as surprise (just a little bang out 
of the announcement) , so I would appreciate your not sharing this plan 
widely at this point.  However, I thought that I would let you know so that 
we would not duplicate any efforts.

Fernley  / Sally

Off and on ( with Jackie Gentle's help ) I have pulled together a one page 
communication note on our fundamental operating standards ( itself a one page 
summary ).

We are in the final stages of this process  - where we draft a cover letter 
for John which will introduce this for inclusion within Globalflash ( the 
Enron Europe newsletter )

Have you any thoughts on draft or cover note ?

Subject: Re: a note being sent out under John Sherriff's name - your thoughts 
on the cover note ?  

I think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental 
operating standards, but I wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough 
of a global message and the means of delivery.  On the means of delivery, I 
am not sure from your note whether or not I fully understand the intent.  Is 
there an article to be included in an Enron publication and in addition a 
letter to be sent under John's name (if so, to whom will the letter be 
sent)?  Or is the letter from John an introduction to be included as a lead 
in to the article?  

With regard to a global message, I think that one of the key points around 
fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in 
nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in 
trading activities.  With these operating standards implemented worldwide, we 
will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we 
will be able to ensure Enron top management that there is consistency in 
operating standards worldwide.  These global standards also should enable 
Enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined 
requirements with regard to trading operations.  I am not sure from the 
article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.  

Finally, a question regarding timing.  The last I knew after you and Brent 
drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this 
was being circulated (Shona took this to do after Brent's return to Houston) 
for comments to all business controllers.  I don't believe that we are quite 
at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have 
reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards.  And not to 
belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real 
meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis 
against these standards.  My commitment to Rick Causey is that I will have 
that global report in production by the end of the year.  There is much work 
to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work 
to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.  Shona 
has commissioned Mike Moscoso to work on this, and I believe that Mike has 
already been working with James New.  So I question whether or not you want 
to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report 
against.  Would a more appropriate time be after the Global Operations 
Controller meeting in October when we should have worldwide buy-in and 
commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful 
exception report?  

Sorry that this response looks so long.  I have been interrupted 20 times 
while responding, so I hope that it makes sense.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  Since you asked for input, I hope that you don't mind that I gave 
you some.  --Sally

Late Jan sounds great.  Meagan does have a couple of big things on the 
weekend in January -- National Charity League Senior Presentation (big dance 
that she and I are committed to help with), the Bearkadette Ball and a winter 
party for Cotillion.  I believe that these are three weekends in a row, 
January 6, 13 and 20th.  So the last weekend in January would work well (and 
I will need a rest from formal affairs!).  Does that work for you?  And do 
you want to do it on a Saturday or Sunday?  Saturday probably works better 
for me, just so that I am back in Houston and doing laundry by Sunday 
afternoon!!

?
Sisters.....this  one made me laugh out loud....more than  once....?


Ingredients:
1 cup of water
1 tsp baking soda
1 cup  of sugar
1 tsp salt
1 cup of brown sugar
lemon juice
4 large  eggs
nuts
1 bottle Vodka
2 cups of dried fruit

Sample the vodka  to check quality. Take a large bowl, check the vodka again.
To be sure it is  the highest quality, pour one level cup and drink.

Repeat.

Turn on  the electric mixer. Beat one cup of butter in a large fluffy bowl.
Add one  teaspoon of sugar. Beat again. At this point it's best to make sure 
the vodka is  still OK.

Try another cup .... just in case. Turn off the  mixerer.

Break 2 leggs and add to the bowl and chuck in the cup of dried  fruit.

Pick fruit off floor.

Mix on the turner.

If the  fried druit gets stuck in the beaterers pry it loose with a  
sdrewscriver.

Sample the vodka to check for tonsisticity.

Next,  sift two cups of salt. Or something. Who giveshz a shit.

Check the  vodka.

Now shift the lemon juice and strain your nuts.

Add one  table.

Add a spoon of sugar, or somefink. Whatever you can  find.

Greash the oven and piss in the fridge.

Turn the cake tin  360 degrees and try not to fall over.

Don't forget to beat off the  turner.

Finally, throw the bowl through the window, finish the vodka and  kick the 
cat.

Fall into bed.

CHERRY MISTMAS!

Please see the following attachments for participant revisions.  

Thanks, Geynille



Thanks for your list.  I have talked with Brent and of the three names that 
you have listed, he wants to include only Cindy Horn.  

I have thought more about Heidi Mason and Jan-Erland and think that they 
should be included.  While they do roll into Europe and also have a tie to 
accounting, they are the individuals in Sydney and Toyko that we are 
depending on to stress and enforce controls.  Heidi particularly does have 
active responsibility for risk, confirmations and settlements on a day-to-day 
basis.  And in addtion to their role reporting in to Europe, we are looking 
to them to oversee controls for other non-EEL traded commodities in their 
locations - weather, coal, etc.

I will include Fernley on the invitation list, as I had mentioned the meeting 
to him when I saw him in San Antonio.  He can certainly respectfully 
decline!

Proposed list - of all potential candidates

Myself
James New - and his lead risk managers
Mike Wellings - UK Power
Coralie Evans - Continental Power
Robert Yeo - UK and Continental Gas
Paul D'Arcy - Structured Products
David Wall - Credit
Tim Poullain-Patterson - Metals Integration
Andrew Cornfield - Metals Risk Manager
Kevin Rhodes - Metals Controller ( there are in fact two controllers at 
present Kevin for Financial Trading and Howard Carter for Merchanting )

I would leave Ralph Jaeger of Frankfurt out of the offsite if places are 
restricted  - He is covered by the mainstream Accounting conferences, but I 
would have Jan Erland, and Heidi and Tiong Hock from Singapore.

I am not sure Fernley would want to be there - but I can ask.

On others  - Simon Thurbin of liquids in london should be in Houston and 
would be a good choice for inclusion. Brent may want his two London 
controllers of Cindy Horn and Kenny Nicoll to also come

Would you invite Kristen to come with( in place of Barry? ).

A long list ( and we may want to cut back ) but all these individuals carry 
the burden of operational risk assessment and management - standardising that 
process would be an achievement indeed.

Mike

PS  - Shall we revisit Agenda and discuss who should start preparing 
presentations - we had thought about engaging RAC, IT etc

Thanks for looking into the OU/Texas tickets for us.  With the ages of the 
kids, I think that we will pass on those single tickets.  The kids love our 
home tradition for the game, and weren't sure that they wanted to give that 
up. (I have cake pans in the shape of the state of Texas and the state of 
Oklahoma - one daugther decorates one, and the other decorates the second 
cake - add some bean dip and chips and it's our own version of a tailgate 
party!) 

We were hoping to bring Meagan up to look at OU this fall, with our eye on 
that last game of the season. However, Klein High School has started the 
football season very strongly, winning all games to date.  That means that we 
may be headed for high school playoffs again this year.  Meagan is on the 
drill team and must be at all games.  Last year, we played right up to 
Thanksgiving in the playoffs.  So, we have decided to pick a weekend in the 
spring after drill team contest season is over to make that trip with Meagan. 

We are interested in caps, shirts, etc. for UT, OU and Texas Tech.  Do you 
have a list of what is available for those schools?

Thanks for the nice words. I hope Enron will be able to look at some
students for summer internships, as I am sure they will be gone by Spring.

As far as Texas tickets go, I can come up with 5 singles, but not 5 together
or even 3 and 2. Let me know if interested and I will try to get them. Might
be able to trade up or something.

Let me know what other schools you are talking about and I can find out for
you.

Again, thank you for taking time out your schedule to come up and be a part
of the OU recruiting effort. It has been your support and efforts that we
have to thank for Enron coming to OU. Keep me posted on what you work out
with HR with regards to summer interns.

It was good to see you in Norman earlier this week.  As always, I
appreciated your attendance at the presentation and at Coach's afterwards.
I am sure that it is rewarding for you to see former students such as Jody
and Nate participating on the other side of the recruiting table.  You have
done a great job in changing and promoting the program.

I am pushing Lexi to resolve the question around interview dates for summer
interns ASAP.  I have also left Mike McConnell a message to make him aware
of the issue.  I should be able to get back with you next week, hopefully
with a change in our strategy!

If you do become aware of five OU /Texas tickets, please let me know.  We
will certainly purchase them, I just made the assumption that all tickets
may already be sold.

On another note, David has worn his OU shirt to work and has gotten lots of
compliments.  He has a number of people that have asked him about school
shirts, caps, etc.  Do you have a list of the schools that you can get
merchandise for and the types of merchandise that you can get?  Let me know
-- we can probably place a few orders through you!

Invitations have been mailed to all VP's and above for the annual Enron 
Management Conference to be held at the Hyatt Hill Country in San Antonio 
November 15-17.  Hopefully, you have received your invitation (more to save 
the date than to provide any detail at this point).  If you have not received 
your invitation, please let me know.  It was good to see you in Norman earlier this week.  As always, I appreciated

I have begun initial interviews this week. I started with Gas Trading 
Operations and will be moving on to Global Services next week (Shona Wilson, 
Mary Solmonson, James Scribner, Scott Mills and Sheri Thomas).  I hope to get 
to your group the week after next.  However, I will be calling next week to 
set up interviews with both you and your Directors.

Everything is progressing according to plan and I still expect  the analysis 
to be completed by mid November.

I hope this helps.  Please call me if you have any questions.  I can be 
reached at X39437.

I look forward to meeting you and your group.

Kind Regards,

I know that there are a number of things that do not work as we had 
anticipated in SAP.  I also know that there are several things where we have 
to change our processes to accomodate differences or gaps in SAP.  We also 
have significant issues with the timing of certain runs within SAP and a 
mismatch of that timing with our business processes.  There was a concerted 
effort kicked off by the SAP team last week to try and identify and resolve 
issues.  They met with my direct reports.  However, we have to reconvene as 
we ran out of time to cover all issues!  I have asked Leslie Reeves and Bryce 
to get back to me on even more detail on this example so that we can fully 
understand how much of this issue was attributable to human versus system.  I 
will get back with you as I know more details and as I can share with you our 
list of first "hits" for SAP fixes or enhancements.  Thanks for sharing this 
with me.  --Sally

and A/R.  SAP went down after the statement was interfaced, but before Willie 
was able to block or net the payment.  When SAP came back up the next day, 
the payment had already gone out and we were unable to recall the wire.  If 
you have any further questions about this, call me.  Thanks.

You mentioned to me the process of overriding the counterparty's that net on

Whew!! Your schedule makes me tired!  I am sure that Brigeda is happy that 
you are involved in so many activities with her school - and then on the 
other hand, sometimes you wonder if they notice!  Work sounds crazy for you, 
but how nice that you will be off from December 21 until the 2nd.  

I hope that make it over the week before Christmas.  The week is kind of 
crazy for us, so I am trying to find a time that will work.  Sunday the 17th 
we are having a dessert party at our house, inviting neighbors, old Huntwick 
friends, etc.  It is for families, and Meagan and Amanda each included 4 of 
their friends in the invitiation list, along with their familities.  It will 
be multi-generational - I hope fun, as it would be a nice tradition to 
continue.  On Monday, I think that David plans to take Tyler and Amanda to 
Longview for a visit.  A commitment that Meagan and I have to sort toys at 
Northwest Assistance Ministries from 12:30 to 4:00 that day has excused us 
from the trip.  So it may be best for Meagan and me to drive over to Austin 
after 4:00 on Monday.  We could be back by the time David and company return 
to Houston on Tuesday afternoon.  Wednesday we have matinee tickets to see A 
Christmas Carol at the Alley  Theater, sans Tyler.  Thursday I am having all 
of my girls in NCL over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for 
Christmas and then we will deliver the presents.  And Friday is Tyler's 
birthday, with a 102 Dalmation theme planned (cake ordered from RJ Goodies, 
but nothing else done yet!).  So I really think that our only shot to make it 
to Austin is for Monday night, which would mean only Meagan and me.  

I talked with Mom last night and invited Dad and her to Houston for 
Christmas.  I don't really think that they will come, but if they do, I hope 
that doesn't mess up your Christmas.  They have only been here for one or two 
Christmases with us since we have had kids.  I think that Tyler at 3 this 
year will be particularly enthralled.  And next year they will have 2 
grandchildren in Austin, so it just seemed that this could be a good year for 
them to come.  She said she would think about it, and I told her that I 
wanted her to know that we would love to have them, but that it was perfectly 
okay if they decided that they did not want to come.  

How about Dad playing golf this week?  What a difference!! I am so glad that 
he is doing better.  

I hear you about Mom.  I think that a blow-up or some drama is highly 
predictable, unfortunately.  She seems to do that a lot at special occassions 
for Cara, doesn't she?  I will certainly help in any way I can.  And I will 
be very interested in the gosipy details.  

Happy baking!    I do have to make 5 batches of fudge tonight and tomorrow 
night so that I can attend a cookie exchange luncheon on Saturday armed with

Subject: RE: Baby Shower


Got your message last night--sorry I missed you--must have been in the
shower.  We are all going nuts here, too.  We have a huge deadline here at
work.  But I worked most of last weekend so am ahead of the curve.  Good
thing, since I have volunteered to be Martha Stewart at many school events
this week and next.  LAst night was "lessons and carols" by the school
choir--with me decorating, baking, and coordinating.  Today I go to school
to make Christmas stockings with the kids--Sunday is the school Christmas
Bazaar at the Four Seasons--need to bring an item for the bake sale.  Also
need to start baking 12 gingerbread houses for Brigeda's class.    Did find
a matching mold to the smaller one we have so I can at least bake two at
once--twelve bakes is MUCH better than 24!  And then there is that dollhouse
that needs my attention by the 25!

I am totally ok with us not doing the shower.  We get credit for offering
but don't have to do anything.  Both money and time are in such short supply
for me that it works out for the best.  At work we start on a contract for
Dell in January.  The company is also going to pay for Java programming
classes for some of us (if I can nail this down then I can jump up to a
programmer level on that pay scale).  I also have a private contract job
with a needlepoint store in Memphis to setup their website.

Am somewhat concerned that Mother will have one of her dramas when Cara's
baby comes...you know she will get her feelings hurt somehow.  Not to
mention the fact that she will be sharing the grandchild with "the most
selfish woman on earth."  Richard and Brigeda went out to the Lowrimore farm
(they sold it and offered us all of the firewood).  Jane couldn't have been
sweeter to Brigeda--spent a lot of time with her.  Can just imagine that
"pained" look in Mother's face at the hospital.  If you are not here may
need you to carry your cell phone so I can call for moral support--or at
least give you gossipy updates on the drama....

Are you planning to come later this month when you are off?  I'm taking off
the 21st and 22nd--they have given all of the technical production staff the
days between Christmas and New Years as comp time so I will be off until the
2nd...

Cindy

Well, she declined our kind offer, didn't she?  As busy as life is between
work and home for me right now, I can't say that it will bother me too much
to attend a shower where someone else makes the finger sandwiched and
punch!  Do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins.  I
noticed some at a rack at Randall's the other day... (Just kidding!)

Hope you all are doing fine.  I was on jury duty three days last week -
really interesting, but totally screwed up my schedule at work.  I have
been doing double-time to try to catch up, especially since I plan to be
off the week of December 18th.


I updated that systems matrix recently, in preparation for our much 
rescheduled meeting with AA on risk controls.  That is on my calendar for 
Friday morning this week, so I will bring copies with me to that meeting.  

I have been publishing an ENA operations report monthly since June.  To date, 
I have been reviewing it with Dave Delainey, fine-tuning each month the types 
of information and format that he likes.  I will bring you a copy tomorrow 
and would like your input on content and format as well.  With the recent 
reorganization, I am working with EGM and EIM to create the same report.  
After we have mastered that here in Houston over the next month or so, I plan 
to share the format with London so that all of our wholesale businesses can 
use the same format.  

In addition to these monthly operating reports, we are working on a daily 
report to be operational by the end of the fourth quarter that will track 
compliance with our fundamental operating standards.  We are in the phase of 
determining the source of reporting (systematic or manual) and the frequency 
of reporting (daily, weekly, monthly) for all commodities and locations 
against the operating standards.  As we get this to a first draft stage, I 
will share this with you, as well as the timeline for full implementation.

Geynille,

Thanks for calling in list to me yesterday.  Sally is trying to juggle her 
calendar in order that she will be able to attend presentation on Sept. 28.  
Her plan at this point, is to attend dinner & presentation on 28th but not 
dinner on the 27th.  Unfortunately, her schedule will not allow her to be out 
on Thursday.  She was also wondering about details of dinner - said in the 
last meeting it had been discussed to possibly do a western theme - with 
jeans (?).  Is that still on?  If not, is dinner to be held at Stone Davis 
Hall?  Can I get the address of Stone Davis & address, phone, & fax for 
Wellesley Inn for Sally's itinerary.

Thanks,
Patti x39106

Diana,

Here's info you requested.  Per our conversation earlier, please try to 
arrange someone with experience/knowledge of Jornada device for training for 
Sally & me both.  Sally is not very technical & will need to be walked thru.  
If she doesn't learn how to properly use it, she will not use it, if you know 
what I mean.  Any help you can give me in setting up training w/ someone that 
will be able to answer our questions is greatly appreciated.  Please have 
person contact me directly as I keep Sally's calendar.  She will be in 
training all day Thursday & Friday, so Monday would be the soonest she is 
available.

as of Friday (the 15th) that HR had not received the final results from the

Too late with your spreadsheet.  The instructions that we got from Donna were 
that I should review the resumes, pass them to Brent for his review, and then 
on to Causey for his review.  Considering our schedules and the large number 
of resumes to review, that would have been an impossible task to complete by 
Thursday at noon.  I received the resumes after lunch on Tuesday, just before 
leaving for the airport to catch the plane for Oklahoma.  I asked Patti to 
make a copy of the packet for Brent, and I knew that Rick would not want to 
take the time to review the resumes without some organization and screening 
first.  I reviewed as many of the resumes as I could on the plane on the way 
back to Houston today (all of the liberal arts resumes and about one third of 
the business resumes) and Brent reviewed them last night after his training 
class.  We got those to Rick today by noon, as he was leaving the office.  I 
believe that Rick will review what Brent and I put together and then will 
pass the resumes along to you.  Since you only e:mailed your spreadsheet this 
morning after Brent and I had done our reviews, you will have to 
cross-reference the info on the spreadsheet with the selected resumes.  

Brent and I would have appreciated some organization and screening of the 
resumes as well.  I would suggest that in the future that your team should 
make copies of the resumes for everyone that you would like to have doing the 
review.  The plan of passing them from one person to another is not 
practical,  and I should not have had to make the copies for Brent.  If you 
are going to ask VP's and MD's to help in this process in a very short time 
frame, then I would suggest that you use their time wisely.  If someone from 
you team had organized the resumes into three groups by GPA's or majors, that 
would have given us a good starting point, instead of a jumble of resumes.  
Two page resumes were not stapled together and there were a number of resumes 
of MBA's included, which should be considered for Associates interviews, not 
Analysts interviews.  Please give us organized information to react to, not 
simply a jumble of data that we have to weed through.  All of us want to 
participate and to be as involved as possible in the recruiting process, but 
we need to be able to rely on the Program for some basic administrative and 
organizational work.  

I send these suggestions with the intent of constantly bettering the program 
and with the intent of helping you to succeed in your role, not being 
critical.  I hope that you will take these suggestions in that light.   

Brent and I (and I am sure Hunter, too) would have appreciated This approval request is incomplete - it does not include the name of this 
employee's manager.  I do not know the employee, and without the name of the 
manager I can't possibly approve this.  Please get someone to complete this 
request.

I am not trying to twist any arms with this question, but is there anything 
we can do so that Jody can make the presentation at OU?  Since he was the top 
graduate from the Energy Management Program at OU, it would be great for him 
to be at the presentation next Tuesday night.  I know that recruiting events 
can be a drain on staffing, but it is also time well spent.  I do know that 
Jody is in a role that has real day-to-day commitments, so if there is not a 
feasible way to have someone calc a book for him I will understand.  I just 
wanted you to take a look at this.  Thanks.

Tuesday night due to business reasons.  My backup has to be out on Tuesday so 
I
will not be able to leave early enough to make it.  I will do my best to make

As you know, exceeding this limit would require contacting the Enron Board of 
Directors.  Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement.  In 
conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily 
report from Ted on component V@R.  Ted called me about 3:00 pm today (Houston 
time) to let me know about this requirement.  Obviously, we want to meet 
Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and  complete 
as possible.  Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over 
the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be 
excluded from the first run of component V@R.  (Mike:  I assume that you are 
very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send 
to the daily 8:30 meeting.)  

I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh 
and me at 4:00 today.  Realizing that the time was very late in London, we 
tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in 
the meeting.  Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that 
Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow.  

Here is the key fact to know:  It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R 
calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed.  The 
Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing 
an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time.   With this 
timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by 
approximately 10:00 am Houston time.  


Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R 
including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power) 
will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:00 am Houston 
time (10:00 am London time).  If this time frame is not met, then component 
V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete.  We had hoped to discuss this with 
you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support 
and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:00 am London 
requirement for officialized books.  

The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on 
what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread 
options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine.  Those V@R calculations 
that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the 
component V@R calculations.  While there are other commodities that will 
currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less 
material than the UK spread options.  Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of 
days before this is completed.  Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of 
this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens.  

I should note that the firm 10:00 am deadline for officializing books in the 
UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:00 am Houston time.  
We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing.  It is 
probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and 
systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report 
earlier in the morning.  

Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or 
not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently 
meeting the 10:00 am deadline in London.    I have asked ENA's Compensation team within HR to conduct a compensation 
study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President.  
This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.

It had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the 
Manager level and above, following the market analysis for Senior Specialists 
and below that was completed by Yvonne Land.  I learned recently that Yvonne 
has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and 
above.

Todd Burke, who recently joined Enron, will be conducting the market survey 
and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful 
experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are 
fortunate to have him devoted to this project.  Please give sufficient 
thought and attention to requests from Todd.  The quality and timeliness of 
your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the 
analysis that I will receive from Todd.  I think that you should each have a 
vested interest in the success of this project!

Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and 
below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of 
Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for 
key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate 
further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.

You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will 
detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be.

SallyI will be in San Antonio attending an offsite meeting hosted by Rick Causey 
on Wednesday and Thursday, September 13 through 15.  I will leave the offsite 
meeting before its conclusion on Friday, so that I can attend a lunch meeting 
with Philippe Bibi, Rick Buy, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford to discuss common 
needs around risk systems.  I will be in the office the afternoon of 
September 15. 

Patti Thompson, my assistant (x39106), will have telephone numbers where I 
can be reached.  Key contacts while I am out are listed below:

I am not aware of an Enron-wide issue, but it would seem strange that two 
such instances occurred within your group.  You may want to contact someone 
in security to give them the details so that they can investigate.

Hi Mary,
One other thing I wanted to mention to you today, it looks like someone is 
trying to use my social security number.  Like Mary Gosnell, I've been 
alerted by a financial institution on an attempt made.  Coincidently, the 
application says I work for the Herman Hospital which is the same for Mary G, 
so it looks like there is an Enron element connecting the two of cases 
together.  I've called the director of security and Enron's in-house police 
officer (who works from the Enron building M/W/F).  Security is looking into 
churn requests and the implementation of the new SAP system to see if there's 
a leak.

Joel had also overheard someone discussing this same subject in the elevator 
a few weeks past, so it doesn't look like it's isolated to Global Data 
Management.

Fortunately for me, nothing has come from the attempts - given I'm new to the 
country and have no established credit rating....I have taken the appropriate 
action so I don't think this will be too big of an issue.

Thanks,
Avril

Subject: We Need You


Some of you were contacted earlier this year by Cliff Baxter, Enron's 
representative on the Junior Achievement Board of Directors, regarding 
participation in Enron's Junior Achievement program.  Since so many changes 
have occurred within ENA since that time, we are renewing our request and 
broadening it to reach more departments.

One of the programs that we wish to support through Junior Achievement is Job 
Shadowing.  This program's objectives are to demonstrate why a sound 
education, interpersonal skills, and a strong work ethic are needed to 
succeed in the work place.  A successful Job Shadowing program requires your 
department's commitment and participation.

The Job Shadowing program consists of the following:

 9:00 - 10:30 AM  Welcome, Company Overview, Video, and Tour 
 10:30 - 12:00 N  Job Shadow Experience with Enron Employees and/or 
Departments
 12:00 - 1:00 PM  Lunch for Students with Mentors and Closing Comments

Enron has agreed to accept 16 high school juniors and seniors on the second 
Wednesday of each month from October 2000 through April 2001.  We need your 
assistance in hosting students within your department during the 10:30 AM - 
12:00 Noon period.   Students may be either paired up one-on-one with 
employees or may remain in groups of 2-4.  Employees participating in Job 
Shadowing will also be invited to join their students for a quick lunch and 
closing comments.  If enough departments participate, it is possible that 
each department may only be needed on a quarterly basis.

Although we have identified two individuals to provide the company overview 
and tour, we are also accepting additional volunteers in this area.  Please 
advise if anyone in your department is interested in assisting.

Please provide the following information to Nicki Daw or Susan Skarness by 
August 30, 2000.

 Department Name:

 Job Shadowing Contact Name:

 Number of Students:

 Individual to Assist With Tours:

We appreciate your consideration and participation in promoting Junior 
Achievement and Enron.

Great job on discussing status and next steps with the group this afternoon 
on OPM.  The presentation and your comments were direct and concise.  And 
your delivery of the information was very well done -- you were poised, 
organized, prepared and confident.  It was an effective and informative 
presentation to the group.  

Thanks for your dedication and enthusiasm on this project.  I was out of town last week doing some recruiting, so I am just reading your 
e:mail today.  I have passed this along to Lisa Cousino and she should be 
getting back to you.

Do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins.  I noticed some at

Hope you all are doing fine.  I was on jury duty three days last week - 
really interesting, but totally screwed up my schedule at work.  I have been

Subject: SAP Initiative

Sally - it was great seeing you last week at the ASE in Dallas.  I'm sorry we 
didn't have the opportunity to work together in any of the groups.  As you 
may know,  I have just completed the SAP HR Implementation Project and my 
current role, working for Andrea Yowman, is to maximize our investment in SAP 
HR.
  
To that end, next Thursday, 9/14, two people from SAP will be here to 
interview non-HR managers on a new project as described below.  You have been 
identified as an excellent resource to participate in this effort, and I 
would appreciate it if you would be able to spend 1/2 hour with this team and 
have your admin spend another hour with them as well -- times noted below.

Please let me know if you are available and willing to participate in this 
initiative.  It is the beginning of our ongoing relationship with SAP to 
develop what Enron needs, and your input is considered invaluable to this 
process.  Please respond with your availability at the times noted below and 
I will prepare a final agenda and itinerary early next week.

Thanks for your consideration to participate in this effort.  If you have any 
questions or need further information, please do not hesitate to call me at 
3-0363.
Thanks.
Jo Ann

Proposed agenda
We would like to interview managers and their administrators.

 9:30 - 10:00 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#1
10:00 - 11:00 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#1
  
 1:00 -  1:30 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#2
 1:30 -  2:30 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#2

 2:30 -  3:00 SAP Team interviews/observes manager#3
 3:00 -  4:00 SAP Team interviews/observes admin assistant of manager#3

What is this project?
SAP is developing new software for managers that will be integrated with the
Workplace. It will be flexible and powerful enough to support managers at
all levels and in all industries. This project is supported directly by the
HR Desktop Manager group and has been endorsed by top managers throughout
SAP in the U.S. and Germany.

SAP has learned that to produce great software products we have to get close
to our end users. To do that, we need your help. Our goal is to visit eight
SAP customers in the U.S. Enron is one of the eight companies we would like
to visit.

Who do we want to interview and observe?
In a one-day visit, we want to observe and interview three types of
managers.
* High-level manager, involved in strategic planning, overall budget
responsibilities, strategic direction. The high-level manager tends to
delegate most of his daily and weekly activities to subordinates.
* Operational manager, involved in running a large department or small
subsidiary. Often reports to the high-level manager. Has budget and
personnel responsibility for the department or subsidiary. May also have
product-planning responsibilities.
* Group manager, primarily focused on a business activity such as
accounts payable manager, line manager, or production planner; but also
involved in managing a small group. Often has hands-on personnel and
lower-level budget responsibilities. Concerned with the day-to-day business.

What can you expect during a site visit?
We have found that the most efficient way to organize our interviews is to
meet with a contact person in your company (that would be me) who will then 
escort us to our
interviews. This allows our team to introduce themselves and explain their
objectives.  Our interviews are conducted at the managers' workstations
where our team will spend about 1/2 hour observing the manager in his/her
daily work and asking questions.  We will then spend the next hour with 
his/her
administrative assistant.

Interviewees do not have to prepare anything. We prefer to interview people
where they work because often the work environment can give us a lot of
insights about what managers need from a software product. We ask people to
be completely honest and forthcoming with us. We treat all sensitive
information with utmost confidentiality.

There will be two teams from SAP meeting with a total of 6 managers and 
administrative assistants from 
various areas in various business units.
  


Sheri Thomas (x36557), one of my direct reports, has responsibility for the 
call center that supports EnronOnline.   There is also a call center for 
Clickpaper.com.  Sheri will know the name of the person who is heading that 
effort as well.  I am sure that it would be interesting to compare notes on 
their efforts and yours.  

Welcome to Enron.  It was nice to meet you last week.  --Sally

I already have a meeting scheduled for Friday from 2:00 to 2:30.  I will join 
you in the facilitator training as soon as that meeting concludes--it may not 
last a full 30 minutes.  In case I can not make the meeting, I have printed 
the attachment.  Thanks. I would like to participate in this focus group, however, I will be returning 
from Austin on Friday morning following the Enron scholarship dinner the 
night before.  I am scheduled to land at Hobby at 8:45 am.  It is unlikely 
that I will be in the Enron Building before about 9:15, and I am scheduled to 
go into a meeting at 9:30 that involves a number of players and would be 
difficult to reschedule.  If your responses from participants for the Friday 
session is thin, and you schedule another time, please let me know.  

I have been out of the office on business for the last several days 
(recruiting at UT yesterday) and returned mid-morning today to a full 
schedule.  I am just now reading your e:mail and therefore could not respond 
by noon today as you had asked.  --Sally

January 27th and February 24th sound good.  Meagan has a big dance on Jan. 
27th, and I need to be here to help with prep and to take pictures.  February 
17th is our anniversary (22nd!!), so that is probably not a good date 
either.  So if you can make one of the other two dates work, I would love to 
come.  Just keep me posted.

Subject: baby shower / dates


Hi, Sal!    I've been meaning to call you for several days - but it's been a
bit of a madhouse, so I thought I might fire off an e-mail:

I don't know if you've talked with Cindy in the past few days - but, if it's
okay with you, I'd like to decline your very sweet offer of having a baby
shower.   Here's the deal:  A couple of friends had already offered to do
one - and I'm having trouble coming up with a vibrant mix of people to split
amongst two showers.
This seems to be a good decision for Cindy, too, since may be a bit short of
cash and energy right now.

However, I would LOVE for you to come to the one shower - if it's convenient
for you.  I would love for you to meet my friends, and for them to meet you!
If it doesn't work for you, I'll certainly understand - especially since you
may want to come again when baby is born.  But, if you'd like to consider
coming, I'd like to know your schedule.  We're talking about a weekend lunch
or afternoon thing I think.   In January or February, I"m available on the
following weekends:
Jan. 20
Jan. 27
Feb. 17
Feb. 24.
I think going any later than this might be cutting it close!    What I need
from you is to know which of these weekends you might be available.   The
"shower planners" are getting eager to plan.  THANKS! -cara

Thanks for the resume.  I have been out of town the last several business

Dear Sally,

Hope you had a good trip to Dallas, although it was a bit interrupted with
you trip back to Houston for Meagan's Open House.  Dad and I would like be
with you all on Friday the 20th of October.  I believe that may have been the
game we attended last year too.  We have meetings, the other two dates, so if
that still works for you we will plan on that date.  It also gives Dad a bit
more time to hopefully get his voice.  He returns to "DR" Bob Raley, week
after next for the results of all the testing he did this week.

Glad you will be over on Tuesday-we will look forward to seeing you then and
glad you will have time for a visit after lunch tool.

Love,

Sue

I'm in the process of putting together some slides for the presentation on 
the 7th.  In doing this, I was reviewing the global operations presentation 
and  noted on the global operations initiative slide one of the initiatives 
listed is "creation of due diligence checklist for acquisitions." I know 
Naomi Connell has put together the SOAP which her group in London uses for 
this purpose which might be useful.  

Naomi - could you send the three of us a copy of this document?

I was able to get into the application this time.  I could see the request 
for Shona on the screen and I clicked "Approval".  The status did not change

Subject: ERMS Resources

I heard today that Curtis Smith has resigned.  I am sure that both ot you 
know that Curtis and Jeremy Wong were viewed by users as critical resources 
for ERMS support.  Even at a stand still, my team had great concern over the 
rumored loss of Curtis and/or Jeremy.  And with the assumption that Sitara 
will not go forward for valuation, then ERMS really has become repositioned 
as one of our key, strategic systems.  There is much to do to "catch up", if 
you will, with changes and enhancements that were put on hold for several 
years during the Sitara development stage.  And our business continues to 
grow and change rapidly, requiring responsive enhancements on an on-going 
basis.   

I would like to get together to discuss the staffing plan for support of ERMS 
as soon as possible.   We need to understand how day-to-day production 
support will be managed and how development work will be effectively 
handled.  

I will ask my assistant to set up a meeting as soon as possible.

 Friday, September 15  7:00 pm

 Saturday, October 14  7:00 pm

 Friday, October 20  7:00 pm  (homecoming) 

There is a chance that she could be added to two other home games if 
alternates are needed.  Nothing definitive on that, of course.  She did get 
put into a routine last year as an alternate, but you never know.  

We would love for you to come for a visit this fall, and it would be fun if 
it would work around one of these games.  I have also given this schedule to 
Cindy, as she and Brigeda were interested in making it to a game.  

I am headed to Dallas early tomorrow morning.  Patti has sent you a copy of

you are unable to attend.

I will be in Dallas from Tuesday, August 29 through Thursday, August 31 at an 
offsite session hosted by Rick Causey to review the SAP implementation and 
next steps.  The linkage of Unify and our Global Databases to SAP is a 
critical one, and decisions around next steps can impact these operating 
systems and our processes.  Therefore, Rick has asked that I attend.  Patti 
Thompson, my assistant (x39106), has telephone numbers where I can be reached 
if needed.  In my absence, please contact the following persons in Houston 
with questions.  Peggy Hedstrom is the appropriate contact in Calgary.  

 Natural Gas Operations  Steve Jackson   x37070
 Power Operations   Stacey White  x31870
 
 DPR      Mike Moscoso  x35242
 MPR      David Maxwell  x36983

I will be back in the office on Friday, September 1.    


 I thought that you might want to know that Randy Gay's wife passed away on 
Friday evening.  Randy is the Manager of the West Desk Gas Logistics group.  
His wife had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had been moved 
up on the list several weeks ago as her condition became more severe.  
Unfortunately, she developed complications during the last two weeks which 
resulted in her being removed from the transplant list.  Randy has a four 
year-old daughter.  

Several of us will be attending the funeral today.  Over the past several 
weeks within ENA, we have raised funds for playground equipment to complete a 
fund raising effort that Randy's wife had headed for their civic 
association.  Through donations from ENA employees, the original goal for the 
playground equipment was far exceeded.  Have you had a chance to talk with Dave B. on any of this?  It might be 
helpful for you to put a call in to Tom Martin today to give him your phone 
number and to let him know that you are working closely with Dave and that 
you are available for any questions.  Nothing may come up, but I think that 
Tom would feel better with this gesture.  Probably wouldn't hurt to log the 
same call or e:mail in to the rest of the guys on the list.  That will give 
all of them a feeling of continuity with regard to information from Dave on 
this project.  Do you have contact information for Brenda?  If not, I would 
get that from Yvette Convey, her assistant.  She is making the rounds with 
Patrick Conner and the corporate development team, doing site visits on two 
additional paper mills that we may purchase.  

Thanks.  --Sally

Subject: Project Triple Lutz

To date, my primary duties have been to oversee the internal valuation of the 
contracts, and their unwind costs in our Risk books.  I have also been 
involved with the Entex contract valuation.  Dave Baumbach has been the real 
key to providing the data, and has all of the information.  Steve Jackson is 
talking with Ed McMichael of Structuring on Monday to get some additional 
eyes and resources looking at this also.  I feel we have done a thorough job, 
but we do need everyone thinking of "what if's."  Our risk books are complex, 
with many hand-offs internally.  Obviously our goal is to ensure that all of 
the stones have been turned, and there are no surprises at the end of the 
day.  I think Structuring will really be helpful in this arena.  After our 
meeting yesterday, I believe everyone is much more comfortable in our 
approach.  There were a couple of things that Dave was going to follow-up on 
(Fixed-price deals, especially Calpine).

FYI:  I will be out of town on another project all of the week of 8/28 - 9/1, 
and Tuesday, 9/5 and Wednesday, 9/6.  I have made arrangements to ensure that 
I am in Houston on Thursday, 9/7 and Friday, 9/8 for the first visit to the 
Triple Lutz data room.  

In my absence next week, I want to reiterate to each of you that I am 
available, and will have the Triple Lutz data with me.  If any issues come up 
that you feel I can be helpful, please contact yvette Connevey @ 
713-853-5953, and she will get in touch with me.  Once again, DO NOT HESITATE 
TO CALL ME!!!  I do not want anything falling through the cracks!
I have let Lexi know that I have a conflict with this meeting time -- I will 
be doing a business review meeting with Jeff Skilling on global risk 
management operations at 10:00 on September 7th.  I just wanted you to know 
that I continue to be committed to the recruiting effort at OU.  I have asked 
Lexi to update me on the meeting.  --Sally

Shona,

I printed 12/4 consolidated report for Sally.  It is again very small.  Any 
possibility that you can change format to enlarge (very large margins).  I 
can go in every time & reformat, but it seems a waste of time to do every 
time when you can just change your template once.

Here is the draft of the needs assessment for global standards.  Please give

Dates:  I think Brigeda probably gets out a week later than your
girls--don't mind pulling her out early is that will work best.

Cara and Chris have a wedding to attend on St. John's in June.  She thinks
she, Chris and baby will go.  Shall we give her that reality check now or
later?


It is good to be getting feedback on these standards.  After you have 
received all responses, I will be curious as to the number and nature of 
changes suggested.  I think for this to be powerful, we will need to expect 
all commodities and all locations to meet common standards.  I will reserve 
judgement on that however, pending your assessment once you have gotten all 
responses.

Subject: Re: Global Standards  

We have reviewed the proposed Global Standards and would like to propose two 
changes for the Calgary office:

 Function:    Deal Confirmation
 Standard:  Brokered deals confirmed within 24 hours (versus the proposed 
same day)

 Function:    Deal Confirmation
 Standard:  Deliver confirmation within 48 hours (versus the proposed 24 
hours)

In order for us to meet the originally proposed standards, we would either 
require additional staffing or a reduction of the review process for our 
transactions.
Let me know if you have any questions or require additional clarification.  I 
can be reached at ext. 6753.

As I discussed in the staff meeting, I am sending you the global standards 
for your review and comment.  Please review these standards to determine if:

The targets set are reasonable for your business and
As minimum standards, they are comprehensive enough (if you would like to see 
additional reporting)

Lastly, in the upcoming month we will start to implement exception reporting 
for these standards.  Please let us know who the key contact in your 
department would be for this implementation.

Please address all correspondence to Michael Moscoso.

Thank you,

Not too mountainous, but I am sure that would be fun.  It's kind of hard to 
fly to Bermuda from Texas.  Easy from New York, but not that much traffic 
between Houston/Austin and there.  A few years ago when we went with David's 
family to Yellowstone, we were able to get a great deal through Continental 
through their group rate department. That works when you travel with a group 
of 10 or more, all on the same itinerary.  I think that our round trip from 
Salt Lake to Houston was $235 each.  Hopefully we could arrange something 
like that.   If airfare is more like $1,000 between here and Bermuda, that 
could be tough.  

Should we pin them down on an exact location, maybe have them pick two or 
three and rank them?  Then we could check on accomodations, airfare, deals, 
etc. to see what would be most feasible.  Or should we research a few places 
and present those choices for them to consider?  What do you think?  Seems 
like there will be 13 of us, counting baby White/Lowrimore.  And what do you 
and Cara envision -- a weekend, a few days, a week?  Our kids will get out of 
school on Friday, May 25.  The 2nd of June is that following Saturday.  

We are having a great year here at Enron, especially in the business unit 
that I am in.  Hopefully, that translates to really great bonuses in early 
February.  I hope to be in a position to fund airfare and hotel for 
everyone.

The Enron-wide PRC meeting to review the mid-year performance for all Vice 
Presidents has been rescheduled several times.  Currently, this meeting is 
set for September 11 and 12.  Per David Oxley, performance reviews for Vice 
Presidents should be conducted after this PRC process is completed.  Assuming 
that the meeting takes place as now planned in September, I will schedule 
your reviews sometime after September 12.  (Bob, I will assume that your 
review will be given by Rock, but I will keep you informed on this process 
along with Peggy and Brent.)

On another note, Enron hosts an annual management conference each year for 
Vice President level and above.  You should all receive invitations to this 
event.  In recent years, it has been held in San Antonio.  I do not know the 
location for this year, but I do have the dates for you to hold on your 
calendars:  November 15-17.  

Let me know if you have any questions on either one of these.  Thanks for your comprehensive note on your plans for middle and back office 
in Japan.  I have done a quick review, and I agree with your thought 
processes.  I also agree that being able to leverage trading operations 
personnel and experience in Sydney, with lower wages, makes a lot of sense.  
While distance is great, the small time zone difference makes this a good 
option.  

I want to take a little more time to review this in more detail.  After 
several months of schedules that have been too full, I have initiated a 
practice of holding one day a week open for work at my desk, with no 
meetings.  That day is Friday this week, so I have put a review of your 
document on the list for more careful review on Friday.  I can send you a 
note then if there are any other comments that I have.  

I should have apologized  in the first paragraph for standing you up while 
you were here in Houston.  Jeff Shankman was on the war path with some 
concerns over V@R calculations on the day that you were in town, and my 
schedule was thrown to the winds until we could get him comfortable with the 
calculations (he was over his limit that day -- never any questions when he 
is under!).  I hope that we will have the opportunity to speak in person 
sometime in the not too distant future.  

Mike Jordan and I have been working on a worldwide forum for business 
controllers for all commodities and offices.  I am working on securing a 
location in or around Houston, shooting for October 23,24 as potential 
dates.  More details to come on that in the next day or so.  I know that is a 
long way from Toyko, but if the dates work for you I hope that you can join 
us.  Thanks for letting us know about Blake.  I just tried to reach him and left a 
congratulatory message on his answering machine.  Do you know who this is?  I don't recognize the manager's name.  Thanks.

General Comments:			I received the note about the Wellesley recruiting team meeting on Thursday.  
I will look forward to seeing you there. 

Will you be in Dallas next week for the ASE?  I will be there.  I did let 
Melissa know when the dates were announced that I will quietly slip out about 
mid afternoon on Thursday.  Amanda's school open house is Thursday at 7:00, 
and parents will follow their children's schedules and meet all of the 
teachers.  With this being Amanda's   first year in junior high, it is 
important for me to meet the teachers and understand their expectations so 
that I can best support her in school.  Mary Solmonson and Brent from my team 
will be there for the duration.  I look forward to seeing you there, too!  
--Sally  On Sunday, the new Fortune magazine was a roadway for my two-year old's 
cars.  On Monday, my sixteen year-old used the cover to cut out pictures of 
money for a school project.  Last night, the magazine made it into my hands 
around midnight when everything at home was settled in for the night.  What a 
nice article!  I smiled while reading it.  How nice to see your 
accomplishments recognized in print.  Congratulations.  I hope that you have 
plenty of copies for your mom and dad.  --Sally Glad you got some rain.  We are still doing lots of watering on the yard.  No 
water rationing in our area yet, but it has been put in place in many areas 
in and around Houston. 

I have to be in Austin for a presentation and reception late afternoon on 
September 5, so I thought that it would be fun to try to come earlier and 
have lunch for your birthday.  I haven't made flight reservations yet, but I 
am sure that I can work it to be at the University Club by 12:15.  

Looks as if the whole family will go to Hallettsville on the 9th.  David and 
I will enjoy the drive, and I am sure that the girls will enjoy the sleep on 
the way over!

Sally, I think will get out and do an Indian Rain dance, as the rain is
falling and we need lots ot that!  MY reason for writing however, is to say
that we will look forward to your having lunch with us at 12:15 on September
5th at the University of Texas Club.  Cindy said you would be in town and
that would be a fun celebration, and Cindy and family will join us.  I am
also going to invite my cousins, Fab and Mary Anne.  Cara will in New York at
that time.

The other is, I am thrilled that you and your family are going to be able to
go to Hallettsville for Dot's birthday and Cindy, Richard, and Brigeda will
be able to be there also as they were able to change their plans for the
beach to the following week-end, so I think it will be lots of  fun, and I
know it will mean a lot to Dot too.  In fact I called her today and told her
you all were going to be able to be there.  Cara will decide when she gets
home from CA I guess,  She will be home from New York on the 7th.

Love,

Mom

Beth Perlman tells me that you are in charge on this system.  It does not 
work.  I thought that this was going to be corrected last week.  I am 
confused about why we are using a system that does not work.  I understand 
that there are bugs in the system.  Was the system tested before being put 
into production?  

I tried to reach you by phone.  You were unavailable and I could not leave a 
voice mail because that was full.  I talked with Torey Hayden and verbally 
okayed the access for Bob Hall.  

Please call me and let me know when the system will be working correctly and 
how you are going to manage these approvals in the interim while the system 
is not functioning.  You might at least put a contact name and number on 
these things if you are going to continue to send these out before the system 
is fixed.  

My number is 35926.  I look forward to hearing from you on solutions and 
timing.

Hello Wellesley Recruiting Team,

You have been chosen to represent and assist in the Fall 2000 recruiting 
efforts at Wellesley College for Enron's Associate/Analyst Program.

We are excited  about the upcoming association,and welcome you to the team. We
have arranged an evening meeting to discuss the details.


Please read the following attachment for information concerning the meeting
time and place.  If you will not be able to attend, please r.s.v.p your 
regrets.





See you soon!



Recruiter, Geynille Dillingham
Coordinator, Debbie Flores



Yes, Harold Powell is providing the clothes for the show.  Beverly Scott, 
with Harold Powell, is coordinating and commentating.  She offered to call 
all the girls to set times for them to come in and choose outfits.  I was 
planning to do that as a go-between, but when she offered to coordinate that 
I decided to take her up on it.  She just moved her daughter back to Baylor, 
so she was to begin calling the girls on Monday this week (I had given her a 
list of names and numbers).  I talked with Linda Smithey this morning and she 
had not heard from Beverly yet, either, so I am concerned that she hasn't 
called everyone on the list.  I took Meagan in on Monday night to choose 
outfits, and Beverly had some great ideas on music, commentary, etc., so I 
know that she is working on it.  Just a little more slowly than I would 
like!  

I have a call in to her to see if I need to take some time from work today 
and make calls.  Why don't you call Beverly directly today and just 
coordinate a time for Jenny to go by.  Her number at work is 281-444-0751.

Sally:

Are you still planning on using Harold Powell for the
Fashion Show?  If so, when should the girls go to
choose something?  We are in a time bind this weekend
because my older daughter is moving back to UT.

Please let me know if you need any help.

I met with Karen Marshall today.  She is in the Community Relations group and 
is organizing the dinner on September 7th.  I suggested that she add to the 
invitation list the other interviewers this year for the scholarships (Roger 
Ondreko and Gene Humphrey), Brent Price and Loftis Fitzwater (one of last 
year's scholarhip recepients who started with us as an Associate this 
summer).  I have also volunteered to coordinate with the University on 
appropriate attendees, as some of Karen's info is dated and she does not know 
people at the school. I will keep you posted.  --Sally

Was Lisa a recent hire that Susan Harrison brought in?  I don't immediately 
recognize her name, but wonder if that's who this is.  

Also, I left you a message about Bob Klein's resignation, as I learned from 
Jeff Sorenson.  I am sure that Jeff has communicated this to you.  --Sally

Sally, 
FYI, Lisa Peterson turned in her voluntary resignation today and it is 
effective today by her own choice.   
She has personal issues that she feels she needs to take care of and she also 
reported that the job was not what she had hoped for.   We have her 
resignation letter on file.

We are asking Enron employees associate (associates who have been with the 
program for at least one year) level or higher  to volunteer at least ONE 
HOUR to interview candidates (this will be 2 interviews).  If you can

Your help is needed!  Please contact  Cathy Lira, at cathy.lira@enron.com or 
x54049 as soon as possible, if you can volunteer any time for interviewing.  
Please include the times that you can interview and whether or not you will

Sally, 
In answer to your question regarding the approval process for sign on 
bonuses, Sheila Walton informed me of the following. 
If you are primarily in agreement regarding a small sign on bonus award,  
then no further approval process is necessary.     If the sign on bonus 
amount is substantial then approval from David Oxley is advisable.   
In our current case, a $5,000.00 sign on for a Sr. Specialist would not 
require additional approval except your own.   
I will continue to monitor sign on bonus offers and provide you with a 
recommendation based on all available factors.

John,

Please let me know if these look like the final ones.  Thanks for your help.

I would like to maintain management team meetings on Monday afternoons from 
2:30 to 3:30 in EB3014.  My plan is to alternate weeks for ENA and EGM 
meetings.  There are a few direct reports, whose work extends across ENA and 
EGM, who will attend both meetings.  Today was the ENA Management Team 
meeting.  Next Monday, August 28 will be the first meeting with the EGM 
management team.  I will look forward to staying current with each one of you 
and Brent on the growth and challenges of the businesses within Enron Global 
Markets.  

I have asked Patti to cancel one-on-one meetings that we had scheduled on the 
calendar going forward.  Although this new structure changes the direct line 
reporting relationship, I will continue to be very interested in the 
professional development of each of you.  I hope that we can schedule time 
together on an as needed basis.  If you absolutely can not find enough of the right players to go on the 
cruise, let me know.  My husband is scheduled for a baseball game on 
Wednesday night.  If I could find some Diamond level tickets for another day 
for him, he might consider giving up his tickets for Wednesday night.  This 
is a last resort sort of measure, however, so I hope that you find success in 
response from others. But do let me know...I didn't have this on my calendar, Lexi, because I wasn't on the list for 
this event that you handed out regarding the recruiting strategy.  My husband 
has a commitment away from home for Wednesday night, and with the children in 
school already, I can't really ask the older kids to babysit for the two 
year-old during prime homework hours.  Patti has some names that I have 
suggested for this event and she plans to call you with those names.  Very 
few of the names on your e:mail message were on the Recruiting Strategy 
Schedule that you handed out, so I would be surprised if any of these folks 
have this on their calendars.  You may need some of the names that Patti has 
for you.  
I have put the other dates on my calendar, however, and I am in the process 
of lining those up with our home schedule to make sure that these will work 
for me.

Dear UT Recruiting Team Members:

As most of you should know, we are scheduled to participate in the MPA Dinner 
Cruise on Lake Austin Wednesday, August 23 at 6:30pm.  We are co-sponsoring 
this event with KPMG, so our presence is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!!

Rick Causey will be unable to attend as he has been chosen for jury duty!!! I 
have also had a few participants notify me that they will be unable to attend.

With this in mind, I am hoping that you will make yourself available to 
participate in this event.  

Please respond via e-mail or give me a call (3-4585) and let me know if you 
will be able to represent Enron at this event.  I will then give you the 
logistics for the event.  It is scheduled to begin at 6:30, so we are 
expected to arrive between 6:00 and 6:15.

Please let me know ASAP if you will be able to help.

Thank you!

I like the trip idea better than a party, personally, so I am glad that Mom 
and Dad seemed to like that alternative.  And in June, I think that the 
mountains sound great.  I have a preference for Western mountains -- big, 
open sky  (Grand Tetons could be great), but if Mom pictures North Carolina 
as the spot I am sure that we can find something good.  We were in Ashville a 
couple of years ago, which was very near the Blue Ridge.  We stayed at a 
place that was supposed to be terrific, but we did not care for it.  I am 
sure that there are other places in the area to research.  There may also be 
some spots around Charlottesville, also just off the Blue Ridge.  I think 
that some people from here have vacationed in that area, so I will ask around 
and see if there are any good suggestions.  In magazines, I have seen 
pictures of places in Tennessee and Georgia ( I guess they do have mountains) 
that look nice.  I will see if I can find the names of those places.  

Thanks for pursuing this with Mom and Dad.  --Sally

Met Mom and Dad for dinner last night.  I did some pushing for the
anniversary decision.  Mom was quite adamant about not liking cruises (Mom,
adamant?  What a shock!).  What did seem to appeal was a trip to the
mountains (really!).  She's think of N.C.--probably blue ridge.  I know
there are some ski resorts there--something like that would also offer our
little and not-so-little ones something to do.  I've been searching the web
for places during lunch.  Will compile some info and let you know...

The record on Friday showed that 127 employees from Energy Operations had 
pledged dollars to the United Way campaign.  Large number, but still 
percentage-wise smaller than we would like.  I sent the message below to all 
Energy Operations employees on Friday afternoon.  We'll see in a few days if 
this helped on contributions.  

Text of e:mail message to Energy Operations employees:

Two weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations that 
receives much of its funding from the United Way.  I was surprised to find 
out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused  
Houston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster 
parents.  I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to 
the center.  Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin 
and meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were 
temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to 
have made that pledge.  

Enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive 
matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit 
organizations.  Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your 
charitable giving during the year.  The United Way campaign is the one time 
each year that Enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a 
difference in the lives of so many in Houston.  Each dollar pledged by an 
employee is matched by Enron.  

If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing 
so as soon as possible.  Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next 
Wednesday, August 23.  I hope that each one of you will consider making a 
pledge.  There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all Enron 
employees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.  Log on to 
http://unitedway.enron.com to complete your pledge card.

Thanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic 
pledge.    Please print the attachment below for me in color.  Thanks.

Subject: Trading v Origination Offices

Sally, Brent,
There are three MG offices in North America outside New York which, previous 
to the acquisition by Enron, acted much as trading offices.
Shona and Naomi have worked with the people in New York to put in place extra 
controls so that they are not trading offices, for example having a trader in 
New York or London own each book and sign off on profit daily.
This process has highlighted the fact that our non-trading offices are not 
all the same, and cannot reasonably all be the same.
Some offices organise logistics things to happen on the ground, some 
originate, and some execute for Trading Offices.

is a suggestion for how we can make this division explicit.
All the cc above are bought in to this approach.
What do you require to be comfortable so that we can put it up to Causey and 
Buy?

It is worth noting that this approach would have caught Helsinki, except for 
the Contract-in-a-bottom-drawer, but no system of control can reliably catch 
that, as was evidenced by EOTT.

Thanks,
Richard

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

The meeting will be divided into 3  20 minute sessions:


SAP Update   Melissa Becker
Strategic Sourcing  George Wasaff
Global Risk Mgmt/Doorstep Sally Beck



Sorry that I missed you this morning.  I attended that last Financial Council 
meeting on SAP this morning just prior to my lunch meeting with Mark Frevert 
and Rick Causey.  Nothing substantial came up on Helsinki, so it was fine 
that we didn't get to talk today.  I had wanted to be prepared on how to 
address out current activities there.  So I can get an update on that when we 
talk tomorrow.

I have a meeting on the analyst and associates program from 9:00 to 10:00 
tomorrow.   I will call you around 10:00 when I get back from that meeting.  I got your voice mail message and I understand your concerns around Todd's 
time.  I think we have it backwards for James to dictate how and when Todd's 
help would be needed.  I think that we can review the "to do" list from James 
and get back with him on how much of that we can help with, who would do it, 
what the timing would be, how we might suggest organizing and prioritizing 
the work, etc.  As I said originally, I knew that Todd would not be 
interested (nor available) for a month's worth of work.  Todd's tendency 
(remember this with weather, too) is to think that he has to do all of the 
work himself.  He has had enough experience that his organization, guidance 
and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work 
himself.  If James' list looks long and involved, how could Todd lead these 
efforts, what kind of team might he ask James to provide, what additional 
short-term resources might we be able to tap into in Houston, etc.  We have 
to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to James.  If 
you are willing, I would be glad to explore this with Todd and challenge him 
to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort, but not do all 
of the work.  I want him to think like a consultant on these projects, not as 
the contracted hired help!  Let me know what you think.  --Sally

I don't see any huge problems with Todd helping out Continental Power.  He 
needs to spend some time in Oslo anyways reviewing the weather business 
there.  I agree that one month might be unreasonable and would look to Todd 
to determine the proper timeframe.  I will talk to Todd and Mike Jordan 
regarding the best way to proceed with this.

As we said before, I would like to be able to utilize Todd Hall for special 
projects from time to time.  I had mentioned to Mike Jordan that once Todd 
completed his CommodityLogic role that I thought that we could take some of 
his time to follow up on Continental Power issues, which could fit nicely 
with some work he could do on Weather in Europe.  I don't know about the one 
month timeframe.  I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and 
determine the best way to proceed.  It might mean a couple of weeks over 
there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.  I 
don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly 
without the family.  Can we still use Todd ?

Sally,

As you are probably aware the Continental Power book split project went well 
but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or 
another but essentially IT did not deliver according to the agreed timetable. 
Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible 
for much of what we achieved.

As you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been 
significant changes in the Continental Risk Management team. We have now 
recruited a strong manager in Coralie Evans from CSFB and she starts on the 
29th of August. We have also added Michelle Waldhauser from the Houston Gas 
Risk Management team who arrived on the 7th of August.

There are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit 
from having Todd here in London for around a month (I say around a month as I 
am guessing within this period he would want to spend some time in Oslo 
pushing the weather Risk Management area forward). Attached is a page I put 
together that cover our immediate needs and why Todd is ideally placed to 
potentially add an enormous amount of value to the Continental Power business.

Could we please get together with Brent Price and Mike Jordan and discuss 
whether Todd would be available come over.

Thanks and regards James










I will be there!  --Sally

have any input.    Thanks again for all your support.  Ted

Todd is completing his short-term role on the CommodityLogic team, and it is 
my hope that he will be able to provide some help for you after that is 
completed, while also working in his role with Weather.  I have sent a 
message to Brent and I am sure that we will talk.  --Sally

Subject: Todd Hall

Sally,

As you are probably aware the Continental Power book split project went well 
but there were a number of areas which were not completed for one reason or 
another but essentially IT did not deliver according to the agreed timetable. 
Todd was instrumental in helping me to drive this forward and was responsible 
for much of what we achieved.

As you may also be aware we had some personnel issues and there have been 
significant changes in the Continental Risk Management team. We have now 
recruited a strong manager in Coralie Evans from CSFB and she starts on the 
29th of August. We have also added Michelle Waldhauser from the Houston Gas 
Risk Management team who arrived on the 7th of August.

There are a number of issues and developments which would greatly benefit 
from having Todd here in London for around a month (I say around a month as I

As we said before, I would like to be able to utilize Todd Hall for special 
projects from time to time.  I had mentioned to Mike Jordan that once Todd 
completed his CommodityLogic role that I thought that we could take some of 
his time to follow up on Continental Power issues, which could fit nicely 
with some work he could do on Weather in Europe.  I don't know about the one 
month timeframe.  I would prefer that Todd review the initiatives and 
determine the best way to proceed.  It might mean a couple of weeks over 
there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later.  I 
don't think that Todd is keen on any elongated stays in Europe, particularly 
without the family.  Can we still use Todd ?

Around midnight last night as I was creating our calendar for the week, I ran 
through the incoming calls on caller ID to find the piano teacher's number.  
I think that I saw yours.  Did I miss you sometime this weekend?  With almost 
two teenagers in the house, my personal messages have dropped very far down 
the list in importance.  I an never quite sure that I get messages that 
anyone calls!  Feel free to call me at work, or I can try to catch you during 
my commute tonight again.  

Hope you had a good weekend.  Ours involved homework, shoe shopping and 
continuing the search for new clothes.  Our friend Mo was in town from London 
and had burgers with us on Saturday night.    --Sally Thanks for the update on Dad.  Keep me posted on what you hear.  No, I didn't 
get the message that Cara had called.  With almost two teenagers in the

Delved a little bit into the Dad health issue.  Apparently he's still not
feeling too well--very fatigued, diahrea (sp?), not gaining weight, etc.
plus the voice thing.  He went to the dr on Friday--I don't think they know
exactly what to do...Cara and I have suggested a nutritionist but, you know,
Mother knows nutrition so I guess that is not needed....

I don't think Dad looks very good but I don't think he has for a while....

I have been able to move up the meeting with Mark Frevert regarding 
responsibility for operations for ENA, EGM and EEL to Thursday, August 17 
instead of August 28.   I will keep you posted.  

I met with Brent's direct reports yesterday afternoon and announced Brent's 
new role.  I will have three persons leading the natural gas team:  Steve 
Jackson, Leslie Reeves and Bob Hall.  I am confident that this will work 
well.  FYI:  Rick agreed with the attached note that I sent him.  By voice mail, I 
suggested Ted Murphy as a substitute for Rick Buy for the meeting.  We are 
set for next Thursday, August 17 at 11:45 in Rick Causey's office over 
lunch.  I am meeting with Ted this afternoon to fill him in on the purpose of 
the meeting and to be certain that I have his support.  Rick Causey suggested 
citing some of the items in my memo to him when we get with Frevert.  Any 
words of wisdom or suggestions for the meeting?  

Hope that everything is fun and relaxing in Maine.  --Sally

Subject: Meeting with Mark Frevert - Should We Move It Up?


Not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than Rick Buy's vacation 
schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on 
August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I 
am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential 
formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind 
the curve.  

Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the 
structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on 
Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are 
flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in 
that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  
Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points 
will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation 
with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he 
wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he 
will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts 
are coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly 
comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to 
report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic 
around systems issues that cut across the ocean.  I told him that you and I 
had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility 
for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.  
That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that 
down before the end of the month.  

What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The 
summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have 
checked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, 
with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  

I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August 
much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL 
operations.  I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, 
rather than arrive at the party late.  
Life is busy at Enron and I literally receive hundreds of e:mails every 
week.  This is not the best way to communicate with me on priority issues.  I 
have looked at your proposal and would be interested in learning more.  Can 
you provide more details beyond your presentation?  What is your background 
and experience?  Can you provide information on your company?

Sally:

Since I have not heard back from you is it safe to assume that you are not
interested learning more about how Enron can automate its confirmation
process?  If this is the case, would it be okay if I approached someone else
in your organization about the idea?

Thanks for your consideration.

I think that you and Allan misunderstood the request from Nelson Wu.  If you 
look at his resume, is already with Enron as an Associate.  His e:mail to 
Allan Sommer seems to indicate that he is interested in a rotation in Allan's 
group.  Normally, I think that associates talk directly with someone in a 
group in which they may have an interest.  I don't think that HR gets 
involved in this process.  I am not sure how I got into this loop.  It seems 
that if Allan has an interest in having an Associate do a rotation in his 
group then he should talk with Nelson.  --Sally

Subject: Request for Interview, Associate Rotation




Hi Allan:

I  am  writing  you  to express my strong interest in working at Enron Net 
Works
International Private Equity.  I am confident that my experience has prepared 
me
with  the  broad  skills  and finance expertise necessary for success in 
Private
Equity.

The rigorous curriculum in the Anderson School at UCLA has not only confirmed 
my
interest in Finance, but also enhanced my accounting skills. After 
graduation, I
spent  the first four months of my rotation program in Enron at the Asia 
Pacific
Structuring  Group. There I honed my analytical skills, commercial knowledge 
and
cross-functional team experience through financial modeling and risk 
assessment.
I  provided  robust  analytical  support that resulted in a successful bid 
for a
$550  million  power  project in China.  In the past five months at the 
Business
Development   Group  of  Enron  Broadband  Services,  I  managed  the  
strategic
relationship  between  Enron  and  Microsoft. The deal management tasks 
required
broad-based   problem-solving   skills,   effective   communication  and  
strong
understanding  of  the technology market. Recently I also proposed and led a 
new
initiative in developing broadband online gaming content for the Enron 
streaming
media business.

I  have  attached  my resume which details my accomplishments. I look forward 
to
speaking with you and further discuss my credentials in a personal interview.

I'm glad to know that she is home.  I can just imagine how much fun those 
oxygen treatments will be!  I know that you will be thankful to have your 
whole family under the same roof.  --Sally

Olivia came home this afternoon at 4pm.

Hopefully much better.

She'll have the oxygen treatment every 2 hours off some massive & complicated 
contraption.

B.

Definitely clever!  I wish that I had thought of the changing the clock thing 
when the girls were younger and had slumber parties.  

I didn't know that there were computer games that work on higher level math 
skills.  I will definitely look into that for Meagan.  

I wish that we could meet for lunch.  Keep me posted on Cara  -- I have 
called her a little more frequently lately in hopes that she would spill the 
beans, but no movement on that yet!  

I think that next week we will know the schedule of games when Meagan will be 
dancing.  She did not make the dance for the first try-out.  It was jazz;  
not her strong suit.  But she did make the dances for the next two try-outs:  
a kick rountine and a pom routine.  There are two more try outs -- one more 
for kick and one more for pom. Hopefully she will make both.  Each routines 
is danced at two games -- one at home and one away.  So if she makes the next 
two dances, then she will be in 8 out of 10 dances for the football season.  
I think that she would feel pretty good about that.  The last two try-outs 
will be next week.  I will keep you posted.  

Have a great weekend.  Love, Sally

Sally,

Wish we could meet downtown for lunch--if only we weren't in different
downtown!

Bummer about Meagan--I agree that physics and precalc would be a killer.
You've probably looked into this but there are some great computer
"games/drills" for math.  Brigeda does the early ones but there are some for
the heavy duty stuff as well...

Amanda must have aced that lock/locker and changing classes thing if she
loves her classes...

Brigeda doesn't start until the 21st.  It is always a strange week when all
the other kids (and her best friend) is in school--kind of waiting week but
we should be getting ready for her party.

GREAT IDEA:  I'm going to change the clocks in my house the night of the
slumber party--to 2 hour ahead.  So they can have their midnight swim and
snack (at 10pm!).  I don't know whether this makes me a creepy or clever
mom...

Let me know when you get Meagan's football schedule...Brigeda has been
moaning about wishing she was in Houston since we left...

Today is Cara's appt with the gyn/ob--maybe an announcement will be
forthcoming.

I'm meeting a guy I took my web certification classes with on Monday.  He
owns a design firm in Georgetown and has some freelance work.  It would be
great to be able to accelerate our return to solvency!

Talk to you soon...

Cindy

That was always one of my favorites!  The old Parent Trap is always great
too,  I wish that I could be there. I know that Brigeda must be excited
about the slumber party.  When does she start school?  Today is day #2 for
the girls --Amanda loves her classes.  Meagan thought that the first day
"sucked".  I have been on the phone with her counselor and assistant
principal this morning trying to undo a bad decision that she made on her
class selection.  Despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she
signed up for both Physics and Pre-Calc!!!   I don't know what she was
thinking!!  Amazingly, for a school as large as Klein, I was persuasive
enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the July 22
deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop Physics and
add a study hall.  She still will take Pre-Calc, but she is in a regulars
class that will be a review of Algebra II during the first semester, which
is probably exactly what she needs.  I was prepared to go all the way to
the school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but
luckily I didn't have to go that far.

Hope that you have a good weekend!  Love, sally

Thanks for copying me on this.  It is interesting to see your thoughts.  I 
suggested that Tom visit with both you and Mike while he was in London.  I 
told Mike that I support many of the ideas of CommodityLogic.  However, I 
also told him about my two dark-side fears:  (1)  that IT resources reporting 
to Networks would make it even more difficult to get the attention on 
projects that we need, and (2)  taken to the extreme, that this concept would 
disinsent operations personnel from coming up with creative solutions to 
managing the growth of the business if all good ideas are swept away to this 
special team for them to handle.  Part of the fun in operations is improving 
things, and I would hate to rob some of our most knowledgeable people of the 
chance to implement creative business solutions.

Subject: CommodityLogic.com

Mike,
Further to our conversation, here are some of the things I thought of while 
speaking with Tom Gros. There are definitely some challenges we have to 
overcome to make the Hub idea within CommodityLogic.com as successful as 
EnronOnLine rather than have it turn out like Sitara.

I won't repeat thoughts about how we split CL from Enron, but let's put 
ourselves in the shoes of somebody external for whom this was presented as a 
potential solution. Well, that's an easy decision, somebody else is doing the 
hard work, and not charging us very much for it. So sign-up, but don't rely 
on anything until we see everything working.

Handling counterparties not using the system
The challenge here is that the Final Solution World with overybody using the 
Hub is wonderful, but until everybody is using the Hub, we have to keep other 
procedures and systems going, which stretches resources, Development, IT 
Support and user. This was why we decided to delay getting Bolero - the 
concept is wonderful, but the value to any user is very dependent on everyone 
else one trades with using the system. This is classic Chicken and Egg. Tom 
has a vision of CL providing the staff to handle this. This is taking us 
closer to an outsource-to-Andersen-consulting model which is certainly 
achievable, although not quite such an easy sell.

How much resource is left
The latest project always tends to attract the most imaginative people, who 
are therefore not available for keeping everything else going and moving 
onwards. How about if we accept that such resource is dedicated to CL, and 
then review what is left in the remaining environment. Does it mean we hold 
off doing anything? If we do then increasing volume means that we might end 
up incurring costs for massive numbers of people! We should go through 
costing for "What happens if we completely stop development of X project?". 
If that shows one would need 200 clerks for 3 years until something else 
comes along then it may be cheaper than developing, but I hope in most cases 
it is not!

Start small to prove concept
E.g. first application in April 2001 only covers 20 fields
This is excellent, and we needn't shout it too loud to investors in CL, but 
for our internal back office costing we need to acknowledge that it will be 
years before we can switch off many internal systems.
We might limit the payback period on projects not part of this strategy to 3 
years out?

Include European aspects from the beginning
This really isn't very difficult so long as one has some long-on-common-sense 
Europeans (not just Brits) involved in both specification and development 
from the beginning, but an as example of how not to do it, look at EnPower 
which took a year to allow just for currencies etc!

80-20 rule for types of transaction
EOL has shown the benefits of focussing on simpler products first.
Once we have robust warehouses for collecting accounting (DTL) and risk 
(RisktRAC?) numbers then we can think about having vanilla products on STP, 
and yet-to-become-vanilla products on explicitly different, manual 
approaches. Until that time, we have a strong desire to include as many 
different prodcuts as possible for a given commodity in one system, which 
makes separating vanillas from others more complicated and costly (Think of 
certain deals in Power99 which are approximations of the actual deals, and 
manually tweaked every so often)

Testing
Tom's first thought is that we could leverage initial users (who would not 
pay) to do much of the testing.
EOL clearly got its testing done, but other experience shows that in order to 
have anything which saves time one really does need to do all the different 
phases - component, system, integration, end-to-end, and then user-acceptance.
EOL saw confidentiality as an issue and was therefore unable to use many 
external users early in the process. It did have massive 
resource-commandability and so obtained input from many traders. Do the 
Support functions have sufficient slack that they will be able to provide the 
same sort of user attention? Given how often I hear "short people", that 
strikes me as something which in London would require significant additional 
resource, even after MG is absorbed.

What else did you come up with?
Richard

Not surprisingly, the organization is moving faster than Rick Buy's vacation 
schedule.  Our meeting is set with Mark Frevert, Rick Buy, you and me on 
August 28 -- two weeks from next Monday, dictated by Rick Buy's schedule.  I 
am concerned that waiting that long to get with Mark to discuss the potential 
formalization of a global risk management operations role will put us behind 
the curve.  

Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman plan to release a memo tomorrow on the 
structure of the Global Markets team, which will include a discussion on 
Brent's role and reporting responsibilities.  Brent and Scott Earnest are 
flying to London next Monday evening to spend the remainder of the week in 
that office to iron out details on supporting the global markets businesses.  
Many of their discussions will be with Mike Jordan and some logical points 
will be raised around co-ordination between EEL and EGM.  In a conversation 
with Gary Hickerson on Tuesday regarding his business, he stated that he 
wanted to be sure that I had responsibility over London operations, as he 
will have support personnel in London and wants to be certain that efforts 
are coordinated.  Separately, Jeff Shankman said that he was certainly 
comfortable with Brent in the Operations/CAO role but that he wanted Brent to 
report to me to ensure consistency, access to support resources and logic 
around systems issues that cut across the ocean.  I told him that you and I 
had had discussions about a more formalized role to encompass responsibility 
for London and that we had a meeting planned with Mark Frevert on August 28.  
That's a lifetime to a trader, and Jeff said he hoped that we could nail that 
down before the end of the month.  

What are your thoughts about an earlier meeting with Mark Frevert?  The 
summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week.  I have 
checked Mark's travel schedule.  He will be in the Houston office next week, 
with Thursday, August 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting.  

I am not trying to rush this process, yet I know that by the end of August 
much will have been decided around coordinating between ENA, EGM and EEL 
operations.  I would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, 
rather than arrive at the party late.  I don't know Mog Hue.  Please return this request to the person who 
originated it so that the Manager section can be completed.  By including the

Great job, as usual, on the United Way kick off today.  I saw Amy Leeand 
Eylesse Kalmans as I left the Hyatt and I told them.  Please pass the kudos 
along to the rest of your team.  The theme was timely, the staging was great, 
the questions on the gameshow were even educational for newer Enron 
employees, giving a little histsory and folklore about Enron.  (I knew the 
WLEC 1 answer!)  

I especially enjoyed the breakfast at Depelchin last Friday.  Their programs 
are important to all of us and the tour was very moving as we met some of the 
children in the shelter.  To all Energy Operations employees:

ENA has experienced extraordinary growth thus far in 2000.  I am especially 
proud of the accomplishments of Energy Operations in supporting this growth.  
I wanted to express my appreciation for all the hard work and dedication that 
you have demonstrated.  We have done great work and I want to recognize you 
for that.  

Although we have done much, we have additional goals to accomplish within ENA 
and Energy Operations this year.  Therefore, as we go forward, I want to make 
sure that you have all the necessary tools to do the best possible job, and 
that any barriers that may impede your work are removed.

To help in this effort, I have asked a consulting organization -- S.J. Bashen 
Corporation -- to survey our organization; to "take its pulse" if you will; 
to help us understand what in our environment fosters success and where we 
could improve; in essence, to assist us in acquiring the "necessary tools" 
and breaking down any "barriers."  SJBC is comprised of seasoned consultants 
who assist organizations like ours to help on issues like this.  SJBC will 
meet with members of our group in a private setting where we can highlight 
our successes, discuss our concerns, ask our questions, make our comments, 
and the like.  This collective information then is studied by SJBC with the 
goal of providing us an opinion regarding our strengths and weaknesses.  
Specific input will not be identified by the individual who provided that 
input.  

Many of you will be receiving a phone call in the near future from a SJBC 
consultant.  Please schedule a time to participate at your earliest 
opportunity, as this effort will be a success for our group only if we 
cooperate to the fullest extent.  Of course, given the size of our group, it 
will not be possible to meet with each of you.  Therefore, if you have not 
received a call from SJBC by August 15 but would like to share your thoughts 
with them, please feel free to contact Cheryl Brown at 713.780.8056 and 
Cheryl will be glad to include you in our survey.

Communication is one of Enron's core values.  I want to stress that only 
through open communication will this survey be a success.  Please be candid.  
Thank you.

Sally Can you help me on this?  Can you give me the name of someone who sends 
messages from ARSystem@ect.com?  To make matters even more frustrating, when 
I tried to e:mail back to get some clarification, I got a message that said 
my e:mail was undeliverable.  No contact name, no phone number, and no 
ability to e:mail back.  I'm stuck!!  Thanks.  --Sally

Dear Rick:

As you may know, I have recently assumed the duties of PPA/MPA Director at
The University of Texas at Austin. In my new capacity, I shall be
responsible for the 2000 Fall Lyceum Series, scheduled by my predecessor,
Dr. Don Tidrick.

I understand that you will be addressing our 4th Year PPA students on
"Global Equity Markets" in the Lyceum on Wednesday, November 1, from 5:00
to 6:30 p.m. (approximately), in UTC 2.102A. Both the students and I are
looking forward to your presentation.

In advance of the presentation, could you provide me with a brief biography
for introduction purposes?

If you have any questions concerning the Lyceum, or if I can facilitate
your Lyceum presentation in any way, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Very truly yours,

It was great to see a friendly face!  Don't ever hesitate to wave or stop in 
and say hello.  Can you believe that I had been on the 30th floor since the 
summer of 1994?!  I know that sets some kind of record at Enron!!  It is kind 
of fun to be up here.  The appreciation for the jobs that we do in operations 
has grown over the last several years, thanks to the hard work of you and so 
many others.  

My family is doing great.  The children start school tomorrow.  Meagan will 
be a junior in high school -- we took a brief trip with her this summer for 
an early look at some colleges.  It will be a big year for Amanda -- she 
starts junior high in 6th grade.  And Tyler would tell you proudly that he is 
"two and a half".  What a delight he continues to be!!  
 
I know that Erin has worked hard.  I hope that she and her husband are doing 
well.  --Sally

Sally --

I acted impulsively when I saw you this a.m.  I was so excited to know you 
were on the 33rd floor where I was picking up United Way shirts that I didn't 
control my enthusiasm over seeing you.

I apologize if I disrupted you.

Griff

P.S.  I hope your family is doing fine.  Erin graduates in December from 
UT-Dallas with her masters in Speech Path.  She and her husband are doing 
very well and very much in love.

There is a problem with this process.  When Sally goes to website & enters 
her ID & password, steve.beck comes up - not sally.beck.  Until this is 
fixed, she will be unable to process these requests.  Please either fix this 
or find another way for her to approve.

I understand that the return e:mail that I sent to Kim Rizzi on November 27th 
was not opened by HR.  Please note on my e:mail below that I had asked for 
clarification on Brent Price.  This was the second e:mail that I had sent to 
Kim regarding Brent with no reply back.  My first message had noted for Kim 
that Brent was left out of my list, and asked whether or not Rick Causey 
planned to supply a pre-ranking for Brent or if I needed to do so.  Can you 
clarify this for me?  Brent reports to me as the head of operations for EGM 
and to Rick Causey in his role as CAO of EGM.  

Here are the appropriate pre-rankings for grouped by level:

   Superior  Excellent Strong Satisfactory    Needs Improv.  Issues

VP's      Price  Hedstrom
      Hall

Sr. Directors Solmonson Reeves Herod Scribner

Directors  Thomas  Mills  Superty Henenberg Perez

To give you more clarity, Stephen transferred to EBS effective July 1, 2000.  
His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it 
would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on 
July 1.  Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth 
transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen 
would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance 
review being based on his work for ENA.  Stephen is very talented and will no 
doubt do a great job at EBS.  During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his 
heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct 
reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our 
other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.  It was his 
failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs 
Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.   It is the r
elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that 
category.

Hi Sally,

The other day you stopped by my desk to ask me a question, but then you had 
to leave suddenly.  Did you still need to ask me something?  I just wanted to 
follow up with you.

Thank you,
Becky

Did you mean to send that e:mail to me?  It was Greek to me, and I assume 
that the Sally it was meant for was that Sally Conover.  Feels like a Monday, 
doesn't it?  --Sally Sorry that I didn't get to call you on my way to the courthouse yesterday. I 
was conducting lots of business back and forth with the Houston office during 
the drive and just ran out of time.  We reconvene in court this morning, to 
have what I hope will be final deliberation on sentencing, having found the 
guy guilty on both counts,  (Prior to the start of a trial, the defendant 
must choose either judge or jury to administer the sentence if the defendant 
is found guilty - he chose the jury.)  I am in the office now for an 8:30 
meeting with Jeff Skilling regarding the upcoming Associates PRC meeting, to 
which I am a rep.  If I don't get a chance to reach you today, I will call 
during my commute tomorrow.  --Sally 

By the way, I thought that when I put "Energy Executive" as my occupation on 
the jury summons form, that I would be deemed to be too conservative and too 
corporate to be chosen for the jury.  Not the case!  In fact, Mark Koenig 
(Enron's EVP of Investor Relations) was summoned for jury duty on Tuesday as 
well, and he too was chosen to be on a different jury!  The whole thing is 
actually very fascinating - just bad timing for me to be out so much this 
week.  But then, there never is a good time.

I had to report for jury duty today (along with 500 others from Harris  
County), and to my surprise I was selected to be a juror in a felony case.  
The case will continue on Wednesday, so our scheduled time for a conference 
call may not work.  I will try to reach you from my car while I am on my way 
in for jury duty - probably around 8:30 or 9:00 Houston time.  




Sally is out of the office today, but checking her calendar for Wed or Thurs 
of that week, it looks like Wednesday, Aug 9 would be a good day for her.  
She or I will confirm that date with you when she returns to the office on 
Monday.

Thanks for the info.  If you'd like to see the logo the team selected, you 
can go to luminant.com.  Hit login (upper right corner) and go to userid 
(tgros) and password (commoditylogic). Touch the "look and feel" icon and see 
the logos.  We selected the first one  in row A.
Enjoy the college hunting!

FYI - I will be out of the office for the two meetings on Wednesday this 
week.  I will be working in Chicago Monday and Tuesday next week.  I will be 
back in the office on Wednesday of next week. 

Todd tells me that a logo has been selected.  Can you e:mail that to me?  If 
not available electronically, I will see it when I am back in the office next 
Wednesday.   

If no one has stepped in to a look at hours spent on the confirmation process 
and opportunities that may be presented there, I will do that when I am back 
in the office next week.  My first move will be to sit down with Jeff 
Sorenson who leads the confirmation group to put some meat around the hours 
that James Scribner sent you.  When we look at numbers of confirmations and 
compare several months of data we will be better able to identify which 
activities were stressed by increased business and which activities seemed  
to absorb increased business more easily.  I also think that Jeff will be the 
best source of information about ideas on streamlining, opportunities to 
simply life at Enron and perhaps create value externally.  All of the 
advances made over the last several years (auto-confirm, the DECAF system, 
auto-faxing, digitized signatures, document scanning, etc. ) in our confirm 
group have been ideas generated by the business group and led by them for 
implementation.  No doubt, Jeff has some good ideas on where to go next.

To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject: Re: Financial Confirm NP6050.1  

Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark 
Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right 
thing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the 
service to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as 
soon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs 
regularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider 
the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary 
when you meet with Mark.

First, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial 
confirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that 
time, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.  
We now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in 
Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.  

Second, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by 
Houston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep 
audit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent 
out after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are 
periodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in 
the confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the 
confirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the 
confirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big 
problem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out, 
which is even a bigger problem.  

Third, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston 
generate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the 
transactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the 
confirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by 
legal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if 
done by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron 
North America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the 
counterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of 
execution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the 
follow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary 
office.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same 
pre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where 
there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston, 
or, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare 
our own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element 
of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are 
we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?

Fourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in 
Houston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has 
staff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are 
reviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations, 
route them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is 
complete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on 
issues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading 
company financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the 
transactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these 
documents.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for 
the financial confirmations without adding any staff.

Fifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the 
confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.  
Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the 
confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the 
transaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the 
financial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for Enron.

Finally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my 
existing employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the 
company in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of 
the documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas 
such as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to 
keep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the 
confirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already 
exists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full 
accountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity 
to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.

As a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring 
that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function 
properly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to 
get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this 
function to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the 
impression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I 
hope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to 
look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that 
exists here.

If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in 
this memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very 
strongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please 
let me know how your meeting with Mark goes.

Thanks,
Peggy

To my surprise, I was chosen today to sit on a jury to hear a felony charge.  
The judge believes that we can conclude the trial by end of the day on 
Wednesday or perhaps on Thursday.  I will be back here working after trial 
hours in the office and checking voice mail messages during breaks in the 
proceedings.  I will be back full time as soon as my civic duty is 
fulfilled!  

Enron is well presented in the court system over the next few days.  I sat by 
Mark Koenig in the jury assembly room today, and he too was chosen to serve 
on another jury.  FYI - My reply to Peggy

Canada deals which were approved from last week then signed and sent this one 
by mistake.  We're terribly sorry for the mistake.  Call me if you want to 
discuss.

Thanks,

Since Dianne Seib is currently on vacation, I am reviewing the financial 
confirms.  For the referenced confirm, the status is currently showing 'Sent 
to Counterparty", although our records show that we have not yet approved the 
revised confirm.  Can you check on this for me and let me know whether this 
was sent prior to receiving Calgary's approval?  If you have any questions, I 
can be contacted at ext. 6753.
Thanks
Peggy






How do we get the right focus on support for Calgary?  Mark Taylor wanted to 
hold up transferring confirm responsibility to Calgary, so we still need to 
provide excellent service to them.  While I can appreciate that Diane is out, 
that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the 
Calgary stuff.  Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand 
how mistakes continue to happen.  While I know that they can't appreciate the 
vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still 
need to be able to deliver top notch service.  Unfortunately, we stub our toe 
enough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers 
pretty poor to average service.  That is a terrible internal PR issue.  Let's 
put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings 
with Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their 
perceptions) and  can sustain excellent service. I am copying Susan because 
she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by  Rob 
Milnthorp (president of Enron Canada).  She responded to Rob quickly and 
handled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with 
you at the time.  But now we need to look at all of our outstanding, 
potential or past issues with Calgary and get a solution in place.  She can 
fill you in on the details in that situation.  

Susan:  Do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with Calgary?

Just so that you are aware, we continue to have problems with the financial 
confirm process from Houston.  On more than one occasion, confirmations have 
been sent to our counterparties prior to review by Calgary.  Attached is the 
most recent one.   We have been assured over and over that this will not 
happen again, however, it continues to happen.  Luckily, this confirmation 
went out without any errors in it.  I know that you are very busy, but  is 
there any way that you can make it a priority to get resolution on moving the 
financial confirmations to Calgary.

Dear Sally:

I hope you have had an opportunity to review the proposal I sent over to
Connie Sutton regarding Confirmation Clearing Corporation.  I am hoping Enron
will seriously consider moving to an electronic confirmation process and reap
all the benefits automation has to offer.  As an industry leader, this would
be another innovative move by Enron.

If you would like to discuss the possibilities, I would appreciate the
opportunity to visit with you.

Please call or respond via e-mail at your convenience.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

Thanks for including me.  Congratulations on Emily.  I know that you and she 
will be getting used to one another over the next few weeks, and that sleep 
will definitely be a scarce commodity.  Those first few weeks can be both 
wonderful and terrible at the same time.  Savor the baby stage as much as you 
can, and before you know it Emily will be cooing and responding to you in a 
way that makes all of the sleepless nights just melt away.  Enjoy your new 
role as mom -- it is a wonderful, life-long experience!  --Sally

...the third time is a charm.  After 2 failed adoptions, God has blessed me 
with a beautiful daughter!  Emily Lyn was born on Saturday, July 8 at 11:18 
am in San Antonio.  She weighed 7 lbs. and measured 19 inches.  She is so 
tiny and has a head full of dark hair!  I brought her home last night at 8:30 
pm.  Our first 
night went well even if I didn't get any sleep.  It's going to take some time 
for me to get used to the noises she makes.  I must admit, there were
days when I never thought this would happen.  I appreciate all the kind words 
of encouragement many of you have shared over the last few years
as I have gone through this process, especially during the really low 
points.  I am truly blessed.
I will be out of the office for a while but feel free to stay in touch as I'm 
sure I'll be logging in often.  Also, if I left someone off the list here, 
please have them forgive me.  Remember, I'm working on 0 sleep.  Please feel 
free to pass this along to anyone I may have fogotten.  Thanks.

Thank you for your support in providing quality and cost effective 
development opportunites at Enron.  
Please call the Development Center Team at 713-853-0357 if you have any 
questions.

 Thank you.Today's ENA PRC was a pre-ranking session for VP's.  All VP's will be 
reviewed at an Enron-wide PRC scheduled for early August.  Representatives at 
that Enron PRC from ENA will be Janet Dietriech, Dave Delainey, John Lavorato 
and Greg Piper.  They will use information from today's ENA PRC meeting in 
representing you at the Enron-wide VP PRC.  I have provided copies of your 
accomplishments and consolidated supervisor feedback forms to Dave Delainey 
for reference during that process.  

Your reviews will be given after the Enron-wide VP PRC, and will not be 
completed before the end of July.  I will schedule an August date with you 
for your review as soon as I know the exact date of the final PRC meeting.  

Separately, you both should sign up for the Executive Influence and Impact 
course that is required of VP's.  I thought that the course was very good.  
All VP's are strongly encouraged to complete this course.  It is a 2 or 3 day 
course that is offered every month or two here in Houston.  I would contact 
Dick Amiable to inquire on how to sign up for this.  
I will be hosting a cookout at my home for OU summer interns, recently hired 
OU grads and the OU recruiting team on Sunday, July 30th in the late 
afternoon.  More details will follow soon, but I wanted to let you know the 
date so that you can hold this on your calendar.  

I will look forward to hopefully seeing all of you there.  And my husband 
will be glad to be surrounded by many fellow Sooners!  Thanks for the update.  I am confident that with leadership from you and 
attention from Bryce that AEC will be satisfied soon.  --Sally

Please join us for an informal lunch on Friday, July 21st in the dining room 
in EB50M.   Rick Causey, Enron's executive lead for the Analyst Program, and 
David Haug, Enron's executive lead for the Associates Program, have been 
invited to join us as well.  We are interested in renewing acquaintances with 
those of you whom we met on campus and in getting to know those of you whom 
we did not see in the interview process.  We hope that you are enjoying your 
summer assignments at Enron and we look forward to the opportunity to visit 
over lunch.  

Please let me know by return e:mail if you will be able to attend the lunch.  Today was the final ENA PRC.  Relative ranking results up through the Senior 
Director level are final.  You and your management team can begin the process 
of giving performance reviews to your employees.  I spoke with Sheila Walton 
today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting 
the employee reviews.  She indicated that the target completion date should 
be the end of July.  

Promotions will be effective August 1st.  It is Dave Delainey's intent to 
announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24.  
This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.   I do not 
yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single 
memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.  I will keep you 
updated on this as I get direction from him.  

Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.  In 
order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review 
process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when 
conducting their reviews.   It is very important for all of us to be 
consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups 
who will be giving performance reviews.  It is important to note, however, 
that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view 
of that employee's relative ranking.  In other words, an employee in the 
Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that 
the employee is doing a great job.   Clearly, a large number of employees 
performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory 
category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas 
of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in 
the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc.  

Also please note the following: 

Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or 
Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given 
to the employees.  This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with 
the relative performance of that employee.  (This has been the stated process 
for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process 
as well.)
Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team, 
yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced 
members of your management team, or those management team members where you 
have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and 
perhaps tough performance feedback.  I believe that we have spent some time 
in identifying these situations.  I ask your help to ensure that we follow 
through on this commitment.  

Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a 
meaningful one.  






It is Dave Delainey's intent to announce It if 0Just a reminder for Monday to get this for me.  Too bad they didn't deliver 
these!  Thanks.  --Sally

Sally,

As a follow up to your call yesterday, attached please find a powerpoint 
point presentation that outlines the business continuity options we are 
outlining and trying to get some cost estimates on.  For the more localized 
problems, we are working with the infrastructure group to develop a crisis 
management reporting structure so that accurate information is reported and 
the right personnel are notified and deployed.  The latter effort, however, 
does little to mitigate the larger risk.

Thanks,

Lunch on August 2nd works well for me.  I have it on the calendar.  I am 
planning a cook-out at my house on Sunday, July 30th for Enron summer interns 
from OU and recent hires from OU.  Mike McConnell and his wife plan to join 
us.  If you are in Houston, I hope that you will be able to join us too.  
Probably around 5:00 PM -- invitations should go out in the next few days 
with specifics.  Wanted to get the date on your calendar, however.  Let me 
know if you will be in town.  --Sally

Subject: Lunch?


Hi Sally and Mike,

Talked to Lexi Elliott and she told me about you all having lunch with
Blake, Clay and Michelle the other day. I know that meant alot to them and
only solidified their desire to work for Enron. Thanks for taking time out
of your busy schedules to meet with them.

Just wanted to let you know that I am scheduled to meet with Lexi and
Shelly Jones on Wednesday, August 2nd at 11:00 a.m. We will then be going to
lunch. Would like for both of you to join us if possible. I will bringing
Brenda Peters, who is with OU Career Services, down with me. She wanted to
come down with me and see Enron and meet both Lexi and Shelly, especially
Lexi, since she is the new OU contact for Enron. Brenda wants to make sure
everything is on schedule for this Fall recruiting. Lexi will be coming to
OU in early August to tour the campus and I will introduce her to Tim Rasnic
(JC Penney Leadership Program Director) and Dean Evans along with other
Department Heads in the Price College of Business. That way she should feel
comfortable when Enron comes to campus in October. If you are available and
would like to join us why don't you either let me know or else have your
assistants contact Lexi and let her know. If you would like to suggest a
time and place to meet, please feel free to do so.

If you can't make lunch and need to visit with me about anything, let me
know and I will arrange my schedule to meet with you. I will be in Houston
that entire week making my rounds.

Hope your summers have been going well and have been able to spend time with
your families.

Look forward to hopefully having lunch on August 2nd.

Take care.

Subject: SAP / Global/ Unify replication problem on Friday June 30th


On Friday June 30th, Unify's production performance was impacted by a large 
volume (30k) of replication/ configuration transactions from SAP.
The mass update from SAP to Global/ Unify effected Enron's business 
throughout the afternoon, causing contract replication to be delayed, and 
missed nominations.

Corrective actions taken to ensure this does not occur again:
Global Replication - Move the SAP to Global/ Unify replication for 
Intercompany from hourly to a nightly (1:00 am) process.  As we could miss 
new data setup dependencies, the volume is expected to be reduced.
SAP Support - SAP IT support will notify Global systems of any scheduled 
'rebuilds'/ mass updates to monitor/ move the schedule during an off-peak 
time.

had these for you on Tuesday for your PRC.  Hopefully, better late than 
never.  I am not certain how the coporate-wide PRC process will work in late 
July for VP's.  I have provided a copy of this to Dave Delainey for the ENA 
PRC which will take place on July 7.  I thought that I would provide you a 
copy as well.  

I will also have Patti deliver a hard copy to Sharron next week.  
Attached are my accomplishments for the first half of 2000.  I will also ask

Thanks for your note.  I have another profile interview to do with Mark 
Frevert on July 12.  At that time, we will schedule a photographer for both 
of you for the end of July.  Will this work for you?  If not, just let me 
know!

Kathie

Welcome to Enron.  I'm glad that you made the decision to come here.  
Hopefully, that decision will feel right to you in a very short period of 
time!  Look for Kristin Albrecht and Leslie Reeves in power on 31.  They know 
more about our power business than almost anyone on the floor.  They both 
report to me.  Kristin heads risk management and Leslie leads operations.  
They can help you on any details about our power business.  

My office is on the 30th floor - EB3015.  Stop by if you get the chance.  I 
will be moving to the 33rd floor during the week of July, actually while I am 
on vacation.  Have a great long weekend.  --Sally

Thanks for forwarding documents for Sally.  She is also interested in Chicago 
- are there Chicago documents you can also forward to her?

Thanks,
Patti x39106I am not sure that I have a high-resolution photo.  Since I'm not sure what 
that is it probably means that I don't have one!  So we probably do need to

Hi Sally!

Thank you for your revisions.  They have been incorporated and the article is 
ready to go!  The Spring 2000 issue is the only one that did not have a 
profile.  I'm sorry that I didn't bring one of the other issues with me, but 
the Summer 2000 issue is set for distribution in July and it has several 
profiles.

Yes, we do need a photo of you for your article.  Do you have a current 
high-resolution photo, slide or negative that we could borrow?  Please let me 
know if we need to send a photographer over.  

I know that you will be going to Florida soon.  Have a great trip!
Thanks again for your timely return of the article.
Kathie Grabstald

Sally would like to view these documents now - is this on an "S" drive?  If 
so, how does she access.

July holiday.

SallyAttached is Bob Superty's summary of the impact on the late noms today.  We 
do not anticipate any pipeline penalties.  On those pipes where the nom type 
is "Intraday", there may be some pipeline imbalance created for us to work 
through.  The logistics staff will have a lot of work to do on Thursday 
morning to contact customers asking them to renom on the pipes where our noms 
were late.  Overall, these pipelines worked well with us today.  
Let me know if you have any questions.  --Sally

There are five summer interns and six recent full-time hires from OU that I 
will invite to the cookout at my house on Sunday, July 30th.  I asked Jody's 
opinion on whether or not they would like to bring along a guest, and his 
answer was yes.  So I will invite all to bring a spouse/guest.  

I thought that I would also include Lexi Elliott, the recruiter from the 
Analyst Program that will be covering OU.  Have you decided on the make-up of 
the recruiting team at OU in the fall?  If so, this might be a good event in 
which to include them as well.  I left you a voice mail message about James 
Scribner as a potential good member of the team.  Let me know your thoughts 
and I can include anyone else that you would like.  

I plan to get invitations out to everyone by July 7.  Since receiving your e:mail message last Monday on your needs in power, I 
have spent three (!!!) full days in PRC meetings since then.  I have shared 
your needs with both Todd Hall and Kristin Albrecht (my power business 
controller here in Houston) and have gotten their thoughts on how we could be 
of help.  Sorry that I keep missing your calls.  I will be meeting with 
Fernley, but I will also try to reach you by phone tomorrow.  It is too late in the day in London for me to catch you by phone today.  I 
will call you tomorrow and would like to throw out an idea regarding an 
on-going resource for operations in London.  If you are comfortable with my 
idea, then I can discuss it in person with Fernley while he is here this 
week.  We have time on the calendar plus dinner this week.  Thanks for including me.  Unfortunately, I will be out of town at an offsite 
meeting with the ENA management team from December 13 - 16.  --Sally

Call or e:mail - either one is great.  I do hope that you are working with 
James directly on these issues as they surface.  It is still not clear to me 
whether or not you two have spent time together on these issues.  I will 
always support whatever changes can be made to our processes or controls that 
will insure better information.  Because I can't personally do all of the 
work, I just want to be sure that you are plugged in to work directly with 
the right management team members on my team.  

I don't think that we are purposefully doing duplicate work.  I believe that 
the manual process that moves information from the Entelligence team to GCP 
has apparently not worked as well as was designed.  While sorry that the 
results haven't been as expected, we are glad to have your input now to help 
address this.  James has reassigned the resources from Entelligence for now 
to work with Mary Gosnell on updates to GCP that I understand have been 
prioritized with you.

Sally,

I raised this issue only to make sure you were aware of the duplication of 
work going on in these groups. Although I fully support your teams, it is 
painfully obvious that the process is not working as well as we would hope.

 Let me know if it would be more appropriate to call you on this type issue 
going forward.

Subject: Re: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty  

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  "cleansing" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie







Let's book Friday, July 21 for this lunch.  I will work on further details.  
Thanks, Sharron. Thanks for the input.  It is just in time -- I attend Rick Causey's cross 
functional PRC for Directors and above tomorrow.  

I think that we have lunch coming up on the calendar on July 6.  I look 
forward to catching up then.  --Sally I would like to invite you as University of Oklahoma summer interns to join 
me for lunch on Friday, June 30.   I have made reservations for 11:45 am at 
Nino's on West Dallas.   I hope that you will be able to attend and can meet 
me in the Enron lobby at 11:30.  We will provide transporation to and from 
lunch.  Please call me at x35926 as soon as possible to let me know if you 
can attend. 

Mike McConnell, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks, 
will join us for lunch.  Many of you may have met Mike, a fellow OU grad.  He 
will serve as the Executive Lead for our continuing recruiting efforts at 
OU.  

Two other Enron employees will join us for lunch.  James Scribner, a Senior 
Director in ENA Energy Operations, recently joined Enron after seven plus 
years with a Fortune 500 company in Edmond, Oklahoma.  James will be helping 
us with our OU recruiting efforts.  Lexi Elliott, a new recruiter with 
Enron's Associates and Analysts Program, will be coordinating Enron's 
recruiting efforts in the future at OU.    

Thanks for the update.  I want to send her some flowers at the house.  Can 
you let Patti know if she is headed home on Friday?  Thanks.  --Sally

Thanks for your front-end research on this.  It's too bad that the training 
provider can't be as responsive!  In a trading organization, 2 to 3 months is 
an eternity.  Sounds as if they are inflexible as well.  Our audience for 
this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders, so 2 days away 
from the desk is not very workable either.  

After I get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility, I may want to 
book them for September, although with a much smaller audience than would be 
desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery.    
Could I get an outline of their 2 day course to review in order to make this 
decision?  Thanks.  --Sally

Sally,
Angela Sprock forwarded your VM to me regarding the VAR training that you 
were looking to set up for your group.

I've taken the liberty of getting in touch with the suppliers to talk to them 
about the request and their availability. As well as discussing putting on 
the 2 day course solely for you group, I also discussed with them the 
possibility of breaking it up and delivering it in shorter  modules. Although 
they considered this, they are insistent that the course structure, the 
activities and the content lend themselves better to the 2 day format. 
They are a very busy company, in much demand both within Enron and other 
companies. Their earliest available dates are: September 14-15, and September 
21-22.

Alternatively, they have more flexibility on dates later in the year (October 
onwards - but that may be less of a fit).

How does this fit with your group?
Let me know if you want to discuss this further

Thanks for the offer.  I will take you up on it.  Can you get a list of 
recent OU grads hired at Enron?  I have the list of summer interns from OU.  
I thought that I would invite both full time and summer interns to the 
cookout.  

I am looking at Sunday, July 30th as possibly the best date -- probably 
starting about 5:00 in the afternoon.  How does that date work for you?  I 
assume that summer interns will still be with us then.  

What is your opinion on dates/friends to accompany you?  David will of course 
be there, and Mike McConnell and his wife will be there if the date works for 
them.  We can make this work either way.   Do you think that people would 
prefer to bring someone along, or simply attend solo.  I will take your 
suggestion on this one.  

After you get me the list of OU full timers, I will combine it with the list 
that I have of summer interns and we can make sure that it looks complete.  

Thanks for the help.  --Sally

I had talked to Ted and he mentioned the cookout you were planning for the OU 
group this summer.  Please let me help with any of the logistics, 
set-up, and clean up.  I know these things require a great deal of effort, 
especially when you welcome people to your personal residence.  I want to,
and insist on helping in whatever way I can.  I am really grateful for what 
you have done for the University of Oklahoma and I am also aware of
the great sacrifices you make for Enron.  If possible, we might schedule a

my most recent opportunity at Enron,  Texas Risk.  I realize the there is a 
great deal I can gain from this move and I would appreciate any insight on how
to obtain the most from this experience.

Thanks

Bob is a good, solid player.  He won't change the world, but he is diligent 
about getting a prescribed job done.  I personally like Bob a lot, and am 
very interested in making sure that he is in the right role for him.  His 
wife has MS in its most severe stages.  He was a manager previously, and we 
jointly made the decision to reclassify him as a senior specialist in order 
to reduce the expectations on him in his role at work.  He needs to be able 
to leave work at a very reasonable hour each day in order to relieve a 
caregiver who is with his wife while he works.  I made a personnal commitment 
to him to make sure that his work load would allow a reasonable and 
predictable end to his work day, and as long as he is in my group I will 
personally make sure that works for him.  I would hope for him that if he 
ever considered a change that a new boss would be able to do the same.  

Danny contacted me about Bob, more from the standpoint of asking me what 
impact it would have on gas if he moved.  I suggested that Brent would be 
better able to address that.  I did tell Danny that the onslaught of EOL 
transactions has been a challenge for gas confirmations, and I am sure that 
they are not long on people.  I assume that Danny is following up with 
Brent.  --Sally

Danny suggested him. I here he has some 'issues'.

I'm neither plus or negative - just fact finding.

B.

I have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on 
the MG aquisition and assimilation.  Would you please include me on that 
distribution list effective this week?   I believe that it is assumed that 
Fernley Dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the 
aquisition is completed.  However, in my role over Global Risk Management 
Operations, I find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of 
operations and any issues surrounding assimilation.  Brent Price, who reports 
to me and is on temporary assignment in the London office, has been keeping 
me updated on progress to date.  His return soon to Houston, however, will 
create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to 
fill.  

Thanks in advance to your attention to this.  They all made me laugh out loud.  I am glad that they all were able to get 
up!  Thanks.

I am not close enough to know Bob's exact role within the group to know the 
impact of the prospect of losing him.  I am forwarding this to Brent to get 
his assessment of the impact.  I do know that the number of deals that we do 
currently has skyrocketed with EOL, so I feel sure that the group is 
stretched right now.  Again, though, Brent would best be able to address 
this.  As you are probably aware, I personnally made the commitment to Bob 
several years ago to help in managing his workload so that he is available as 
needed at home for his wife.  For Bob's sake, I would want to make sure that 
he is in a situation where that is understood and appreciated.

managing with this on a regular basis.  Do we have a well-defined follow-up 
process to ensure that the outstanding confirms do go out soon?  This is a 
great tool to share with other groups that are doing confirmations.  It would 
be nice to have a standard format that all groups would use to track this.  
Have you shared this with other groups within Energy Operations that are

I think that it is a great idea to compare recommendations for promotions.  
Our meeting will take place on December 8th, so we can be ready to discuss 
promotion recommendations as early as Monday, December 11.  When would be a 
good time for you?  

The invitation to attend our December 8th meeting still stands.  I know that 
it is along way to come for a single meeting (although it will most likely be 
a fully day), but if there are other things that you could accomplish while 
here, it could be worth it.  --Sally

Sally 

This is great but you are right in that we probably do not have time to cross 
calibrate for the full global population of Risk Ops - perhaps next year. 
Also, from discussions with Fernley the higher grades will form part of Rick 
Causey's PRC ranking process - so we are left with lower risk post that ( 
Fernley said he would forward his note to Rick to yourself ).

My remaining concern is that any promotions, particularly in the risk group, 
which are not matched across Houston/London or indeed between EGM London and 
EEL London may create people risk. Can I suggest we compare promotions from 
senior specialist ( up to manager ) upwards ?

Hope everything is going well

Subject: Re: Cross calibration for Operations people globally  

I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be 
held in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be 
held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC 
meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary 
due to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed 
in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  

The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM 
and EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior 
Specialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review 
meetings mirror the "preferred distribution", which as you probably know 
suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should 
therefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work 
has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not 
be too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the 
managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good 
jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing 
suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I 
still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss 
my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of 
course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels 
that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my 
direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda 
Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to 
attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  

Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this 
year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the

Subject: Cross calibration for Operations people globally

Sally

I have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about 
checking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) 
which raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross 
calibration done by yourself. Can I ask what are the plans?







Hi, Mike.  It is almost 2 pm Houston time as I am reading your message, so my 
hope is that you have already headed home today.  I would love to visit with 
you.  Would it work for us to talk at 9 am (3 pm London time) on Friday?   
Another good time for us to talk my be during my commute into the office.  I 
would expect to be in my car from about 7:00 to 8:00 am (Houston time) 
tomorrow.  My car phone number is 713-417-1591.  A few weeks ago I put 
together a list of key individuals for you to meet when you do come to 
Houston.  Once you have scheduled a trip, my offer still stands to set up 
these meetings for you.  It may be easier for my assistant to coordate these 
things in Houston than for you assistant to attempt that from London, given 
the time difference.  

I will look forward to speaking with you.  I understand that your value in 
the office is already felt.  --Sally

I feel I already know you having had the benefit of sitting next to Brent for 
the last few months- but I realise I have been impolite in not organising a 
call just to introduce myself and arrange dates for a visit to Houston.

Additionally Brent, Shona and I have spent some excellent time on the subject 
of Internal Control Enivronment / Operational Risk / Doorstep and I wanted to 
agree potential next steps with you.
Do you have anytime today / tomorrow ?

HI, Sal.  You ARE correct:  we would be coming the weekend of the 17th/18th.
We'll leave Austin noonish on Saturday (I have a rowing lesson Saturday
morning!) and probably leave Houston mid-afternoon on Sunday.  Glad it still

I left a voice mail message for Dave Delainey this morning asking for

The only conversation I have had with Jeff regarding this topic was when I 
was in Houston and he had inquired as to when I was returning, stating that 
he was going to need some help in integrating another business within Gas 
Trading (and alluded to the possibility of it being Liquids related).  My 
thoughts are that it would need to be supported out of my group since it is 
going to roll up to Jeff.  Do you want me to set up a conference call with 
you, Scott Earnest and myself to discuss?  Subsequent to that we should 
probably have a conference call with Jeff to get specifics.  Let me know what 
I need to do on this.

Subject: LNG 


Scott Earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had 
earlier today with Jeff Shankman and Vince Kaminiski that Jeff announced that 
he had gotten the nod from Mark Frevert to manage the LNG book of business.  
(This sentence structure is bad, but you get the drift.)  That is probably 
what Shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility.  I will 
assume that is in addition to gas, but I don't know that for sure.  

Scott has been working on setting up the risk books for LNG, working closely 
over the last several weeks with Vince Kaminski.  We need to talk about this 
business and the best way to support it.  Have you had any conversations with 
Jeff on this?   




I interviewed Analyst/Associate candidates in the office on Saturday, as did 
four other directors/senior directors from Energy Operations.   I completed 
the evaluations of the four candidates that I interviewed and submitted 
those, but was unable to stay for the decision meeting after lunch due to 
commitments to attend a funeral.  I talked with Ted Bland this morning and he 
suggested that I provide you with a list of candidates that could be a fit in 
Energy Operations.  

Analysts

Tara Piazze - potential fit in one of my risk management operations teams

Joseph Piotrowski - AA consulting background; would be a good fit for my 
operations team focused on EOL (these are ENA employees) -- I need to add 
more  strength to this group

Charles Ames - currently works in back office for a brokerage firm; wants  to 
trade; would like to have him in risk to learn the business and Enron's risk 
books;  we  could immediately benefit from his background, while he learns 
Enron and how we manage risk; then he could add even more value in moving to 
a trading  role, if appropriate


Better Fits as Direct Hires (not analyst or associate, based on work 
experience and fit)

Mike Perun - VP of small bank; Ted brought him in with my group in mind; two 
of my directors interviewed him on Saturday; we'd like to consider him as a 
direct hire

Jason Sukenik- Undergrad and masters degrees in accounting, plus MBA; could 
be good fit as direct hire in as manager/director based on experience


Associates

Ryan Ngo - I believe that Kevin Presto suggested him for my group

Adele Pickens - She's on my list; need to research interviewers comments who 
suggested my group for an assignment for her (I don't think that anyone from  
Energy Operations interviewed him or her) 

Jennifer Bagwell - Apparently remarked to two interviewers that she did not 
want to trade; would like to see if there is a fit for her in managing risk 
or operations


Let me know about next steps in this process.  I would be glad to talk about 
any of this in more depth.  I got the memo from Naomi that you sent.  First, who is Doug Imrie?  Does he 
have a strong background in trading operations?  Will he be  able to 
coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective, and will he be able 
to be the front-runner on how MG runs its business so that we will get a jump 
start on how best to assimilate the business?   I think that this effort 
should be much broader than deal testing.  It should encompass assessing 
people, processes, controls, systems support, etc.  To do this quickly and 
effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading 
operations.   I don't know Naomi's background, but I wonder if she will be 
the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in 
operations on a daily basis.  

Patrick Conner left me a message today to be certain that we are plugged in 
with an appropriate team from ENA to review the Chicago and New York 
offices.  From the sound of Naomi's memo, it looks as if Andy Cornfield is 
assume to have the US responsibility. Again, I don't know Andy.  

Should we circle the wagons and develop a plan for doorstep reviews that 
includes some others in the process, particularly those that have been 
involved in some doorstep reviews to date and those that have daily 
operational experience?  I have also mentioned Shona as a good resource as 
well.  Scott Earnest announced in the staff meeting today that in a meeting he had 
earlier today with Jeff Shankman and Vince Kaminiski that Jeff announced that 
he had gotten the nod from Mark Frevert to manage the LNG book of business.  
(This sentence structure is bad, but you get the drift.)  That is probably 
what Shankman has alluded to in terms of increased responsibility.  I will 
assume that is in addition to gas, but I don't know that for sure.  

Scott has been working on setting up the risk books for LNG, working closely 
over the last several weeks with Vince Kaminski.  We need to talk about this 
business and the best way to support it.  Have you had any conversations with 
Jeff on this?   I apologize for the late notice, but Sally has just been notified that a 
cross-functional PRC meeting w/ Rick Causey has been set for this Friday, 
December 1.  She will need a compilation of your accomplishments by 
Thursday.  If you have directors reporting to you, please request that they 
also have data in to Sally by Thursday.

Thanks for your help,
Patti x39106We willl consider that a rain check.  Just let know in a cooler month when 
you will be around and I know that David will make his schedule work to

Separately, I didn't get time to speak with you individually when I was in

while you are in Houston, I would love to visit face to face to hear from

I didn't know that you were talking to Jennifer.  I had put her on the list 
of attendees at last Thursday's meeting with Tom Gros.  He had asked about 
someone being included that had been involved with Enron Online, I felt that 
she might be perfect to be involved in Networks with her exposure to EOL.  I 
don't know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that 
conference call.  What is she going to do for you in gas?  We may be 
hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the Networks project who has 
been as involved with EOL.  --Sally

My  trading operations team, under the leadership of Mary Solmonson, is 
sponsoring a working session on Thursday and Friday, June 15 and 16 in the 
ballroom at the Rice.   Mary leads the team that manages Global Databases, 
our global contract, counterparty and facilities databases that create the 
common platform that facilitates the consolidation of information for credit 
aggregation, risk exposure, customer information, feeds to SAP for financial 
reporting, etc.    In addition to managing these databases, Mary has 
harnessed information from these databases in a new way to create an 
effective prospecting tool for use by originators and traders.  This tool can 
help measure and increase coverage by industry segments.  This project,  
Entelligence, has been endorsed by Greg Whalley and Jeff Shankman and is 
currently under development for delivery later this quarter.  

We invite you to speak to the group of Enron employees from offices worldwide 
who will attend the working session next week.  Please let me know if you are 
interested and if June 15 or June 16 fits your schedule.  

Thanks for considering this speaking opportunity.  
Please pring attached presentation for me in color.  Thanks.

Not much unpacking yet -- our main focus up until Sunday morning was getting 
Amanda ready for camp.  There was still a good bit of painting going on this 
week, so this weekend I do hope to get quite a bit unpacked.  

We got our first letter from Amanda yesterday , and it sounds as if she is 
having fun.  Said that she was homesick and missed us, but was not sad.  Has 
some of the same girls in her cabin that she had last summer.  

I plan to shop this weekend for your birthday gift for Amanda.  As we 
discussed, she will have a continuation of her birthday when she gets back 
home next weekend.  So by the end of the weekend I should be able to give a 
total for gifts for both girls.

I still agree that this is not the time for promotion to VP.  Kristin 
certainly did an outstanding job in her role within ENA during the first half 
of the year.  I would like to see her develop a broader view across the 
organization and be able to be more effective in working with others and 
sharing her knowledge and experience before she is promoted to VP.  I guess 
that the one caveat that I would put out, is to wait and see if there are 
other names brought forth from other parts of the organization that would 
make it seem that Kristin should be in that pack.  --Sally

as we discussed - my feeling is to not promote to VP this time - are you cool

Scott's name is not familiar to me and the only person from my group who is 
in the London office now is Brent Price.  I looked up Scott's name on our 
Enron People Finder, and it would appear that he is in the IT department.  I 
assume that he is someone who is on assignment in the UK, so I would suggest 
that you contact Beth Perlman in Houston who leads IT for ENA or talk with 
Mark Pickering in IT in London.  My role in Houston is over the trading 
operations groups, but does not include IT.  I wish that I could answer your 
specific question for you, but I think that referring you to IT will get you 
the answer that you need.

The cost centre you provided to Tara (Project Q - 800001745) is not accepted

Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks and apologies again for bothering you with such a trivial query.

Subject: Re: Enron Trading  

I had a chance to review your presentation.  Bill and I have been working 
with Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help 
insure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place 
in India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as 
an origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying 
the coal.  Therefore, the net Enron position will probably be carried in the 
London books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to 
determine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These 
books should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd 
party sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local 
curves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and 
energy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading 
activity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process 
(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management 
administration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting 
will be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general 
ledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The 
following questions need to be addressed:  

  With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be 
required?
      My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for 
determining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the 
      policy, if necessary.   
  What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?
      The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure 
required for the India office.    

Sally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and 
arrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen 
complicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your 
hand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we 
demonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain 
sigh-off for trading from Rick Buy. 

Looking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date. 


Thanks,
Wanda Curry

Wanda,

It was nice talking to you on the conference call. Have you had a chance to 
review my presentation?. Your comments would be extremely helpful to me. When 
we setup the Risk/Credit/Accnt/MIS/Internal Control function, I want to make 
sure we do it RIGHT the FIRST time, keeping in mind that there is always room 
for improvement later.

In addition, I would like to discuss with you certain thought I have on the 
accounting, budgeting,internal controls and internal audit areas in EIPL. Do 
you plan to travel to India in the near future. Please let me know.

Thanks and Regards.









I asked my new hire to suggest names of people that she knows that would be 
good for to consider hiring.  Here is her response.  Tony Vasut had called 
her and asked for this list as well.  Do you have him keyed in on our blitz 
effort for hiring of risk personnel?  Or is he working on some other 
initiative?  I have not reviewed the names nor Shona's comments in detail 
yet, but I wanted to pass these along for inclusion in our efforts.  --Sally

Subject: People to consider recruiting

As requested, I've created a list of people who:
have mentioned to me that they are interested in changing careers/companies or
I think would be a great asset to Enron.

I've jotted down what I know about each person and I hope you find it 
useful.  I've organized it from most experienced to least experienced.  If 
you would like to talk me about any of these people or ask me to contact 
them, just let me know.

Andy Dunn - until 2 weeks ago he was a director in the PwC risk management 
practice.  Due to a falling out between Andy and the partners (not client 
related), he left the firm.  He is extremely well respected by both the audit 
and the non-audit personnel, and his leaving came as an unexpected surprise.  
I have worked with him on a number of occasions and would highly recommend 
him to Enron.  The downside to Andy is that he lives in Denver, is used to 
travelling a lot, but, at the last time we spoke (a few months ago), is not 
interested in leaving Denver.  His cell phone (if still in use) is 303 807 
0040.

Mark (Allan) Smith - Mark is in the PwC energy risk management practice in 
Houston.  We worked very closely together throughout 1999 on projects for 
Coral Energy and Equiva trading.  Prior to working at PwC, Mark was at BP for 
15 years where he had many different roles (he worked as a crude trader, 
products trader, he worked in the risk management department, in the refinery 
itself as an engineer).  Mark was excellent to work with.  Clients are 
extremely impressed with his knowledge and background.  I would highly 
recommend him for a leadership role at Enron.  I spoke to him yesterday and 
he is interested in talking with you.  His direct number is 713 356 4233.  
His cell phone number is 713 412 3890.

Alan Beaton - senior manager KPMG's systems control group (IRM).  He works 
with my husband.  I know him on a personal basis.  He is trying to find 
opportunities outside of the audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 
2000).

Marilyn Chee - She currently works for Equiva trading, manager in-charge of 
accounting for derivatives.  Her role has expanded to encompass FAS 133 and 
all mtm accounting entries.  She liases with all book heads (crude and all 
products).  In the past, she worked in the Texaco internal audit department.  
She was my main contact at Equiva when I was at PwC.  She is extremely 
diligent and very professional.  I enjoyed working with her greatly and have 
to say she was one of the best people I have worked with in the capacity of a 
client/professional relationship.    Marilyn has a lot of responsibilities at 
the alliance and is extremely well respected.  She has had a difficult year 
as she is doing a job that should be done by 3+ people.  She has mentioned to 
me that she is not happy about the fact that her load continues to increase, 
and has even mentioned finding another job.  However, due to the fact that 
she is so well respected where she is, she may be difficult to recruit (713 
277 6280).  If you contact her I would not want my name associated with it 
due to the PwC/alliance relationship.

Rebecca Crider - She has been working at Coral Energy for approximately a 
year, reporting to the VP of risk control.  Before that she was an audit 
manager at AA.  I have worked with her briefly and she seemed very 
conscientious.  I do not know if she is looking or not, but its worth a try! 
(713 230 3000 general line).

Kim Nelson - She is a manager in the risk group at AA, and just transferred 
over from KPMG.  I have not met her, but I did hear that she is not doing 
what she had expected at AA.  I don't know her number but you could reach her 
at the general AA line.

Kevin Schroder - audit manager at KPMG in the energy department.  I do not 
know him, but do know he is looking for opportunities outside the 
audit/consulting area (general line 713 319 2000).

Keith Considine - He is currently a senior accountant at PwC.  He is the best 
senior PwC Houston has, as well as probably one of the best people I have 
ever worked with (the top of his class).  Although he only has 4 years of 
work experience (all at PwC), he performs in a manager capacity.  He worked 
for me on the Coral Energy audit engagement and received an excellent 
evaluation from both myself and the partners (we all agreed that he is one of 
the best people any of us have seen or worked with).  He is currently working 
on a project at one of PwC's clients to standardize their mid office 
processes .  He definitely does not see himself as a long time employee of 
PwC, but is currently planning on staying there until he is promoted to 
manager.  I actually recommended him for a promotion to manager at July 1 
this year, but due to capacity issues, I don't expect that the promotion will 
be approved. Since I've only been with Enron a short time and would like to 
continue good relations with PwC, I would appreciate whoever contacts Keith 
to elude that it is someone else other than myself who gave you his name. His 
number is 713 356 5617.

Dave Simpson - analyst at Koch Energy in Houston, has a degree in accounting 
and has work experience of about 9 months.  He is very interested in leaving 
Koch.  I know him on a person basis, but have not worked with him.  He is a 
good guy and very likeable.  I don't have his phone number, but should be 
reachable through the general number for Koch.

Admin assistants

Connie Shugart - she is currently working at PwC as an administrative 
assistant.  She is also involved in recruiting experienced personnel for 
PwC's audit and internal audit service lines.  She is very interested in 
Enron and has asked me a few times to get her a contact here.  I have not 
worked directly with her but due to her close proximity to my office I talked 
to her a number of times and was very impressed. (713 356 4000 - general PwC 
number).

Ellen Robertson - She is an administrative assistant who is looking to leave 
PwC.   I have never worked with her, but she did come to ask me my opinion on 
how she should go about finding other work. (713 356 4000 PwC general line).
FYI - I believe that Shona will prove to be a great asset to Enron.  We are 
following up on her leads for talent.  --Sally

none of this is a surprise and the appropriate arrangements have been made 
for desk, phone and computers for all.  

Secondly, please make a point of seeking out these interns and welcoming them 
to Enron.  

Finally, after I know where these analysts are placed, we will have a brief 
meeting with the analysts' managers and any of you under whom they will be 
working to discuss ideas on making the analysts assignments meaningful this 
summer.  I welcome ideas on this from any of you.     FYI  -- Let me know who Angelic will report to and what she will be doing.  
Thanks.

Subject: Summer Analyst Information Session

THANK YOU .... to those of you who attended the summer analyst info session.  
For those of you who couldn't attend,  the information will be delivered to 
you via inter-office mail.  

As we discussed yesterday, our goal is to ensure a quality summer for all of 
our interns.  To continue in those efforts we encourage you to schedule a 
meeting with your intern during his/her first week to:
 explain group/department initiatives
establish roles/responsibilities and define performance expectations

ALSO, PLEASE NOTE:  interns starting on Monday, May 22 will be available to 
report directly to their supervisors following lunch.  Due to availability 
and limited space, PC training will take place later in the week.  Interns 
that start on June 5 will report to their supervisors that afternoon 
following PC training. 

Thank you again for your time and your support.  Please contact me if you 
have any questions.

Lunch probably won't work in that time frame.  I will be out on vacation on 
Monday.  Tuesday's lunch is a standing Risk Forum Meeting and Wednesday I 
will be out of the office during the lunch hour for a school function for one 
of my daughters.  I will check with Ted Murphy on the Tuesday Risk Forum 
meeting, as occassionally the meeting is cancelled.  I will get back in touch 
if the Tuesday lunch does open up.  Would Amita like to meet at another time 
during those days?  There is a possibility that I could do an early dinner on 
Tuesday evening.  How does that work with Amita's schedule?  --Sally

Hi Sally

Amita from PCG - London will be visiting your offices next Monday - Wednesday 
and would like to meet with you for lunch.  Do you have any available time in 
these three days?

Many thanks,

Leah
PCG London

I agree that discussing the numbers in person with AA would be the right way 
to handle this.  And, I am looking to Brent in managing the current 
reconciliation process so he can best address the timing of the meeting.  My 
expectation is that the vast majority of the $49MM variance will be explained 
and finalized by Monday at 11:00 am.  This finalization obviously involves 
both the gas operations group and gas accounting.  I will be on vacation on 
Monday while my parents are in town for a visit, but I have carved out time 
during the day at 11:00 to be in the office for an update on the 
reconciliation, as it is very important to me.  

--Sally

Subject: AA request on DPR to G\L entry

Someone from Arthur Andersen called Troy today asking to see the details of 
our DPR to G\L entry for March accounting.  I instructed him to tell them 
that we would be happy to set up a meeting for later next week to sit down 
with them and OA to discuss the process, the April numbers and the 
reconciliation of those numbers.  As I believe you all know, the entry that 
we had to book in March was close to $49 million and the April entry was 
closer to $25 million.  They know how the process works and should understand 
that the variances coming from the first several months are primarily timing, 
but experience tells me that they will over react if we simply turn over the 
analysis showing $49 as they have requested.  In light of the current 
reconciliation effort do you think we will be able to talk to them about the 
older items ( I would suggest only discussing things that fall into the 1999 
and prior category) late next week?

Let me know your thoughts.

Mary,

Sally says this is okay.

Mary Gosnell has been performing well in her new role as Manager.  I would 
like to offer Mary some coaching sessions with Team Leadership to develop her 
presence and language skills when dealing with management personnel.  Any 
problems with that ?



Sounds as if you will have a full day on Monday.  I am glad that you are 
eager to get together to kick off your role -- we will have to save that for 
Tuesday, however.  I am taking the day off on Monday to be with my parents 
who will be in from Austin for one of my daughter's piano recital.  9:30 to 
10:30 on Tuesday would be a great time for us to get together.  There are two 
other meetings that day that I would like to have you attend with me.  One is 
a weekly Risk Forum luncheon from 11:30 to 1:00 and the other is a meeting at 
3:00 on trading operations for Tokyo.  I will give the details on location 
and list of attendees when you and I meet on Tuesday morning.  

Enjoy your next few days.  I hope that orientation is helpful on Monday.  
Check with my assistant, Patti Thompson, on where you will be sitting.   I 
look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.  --Sally

Dear Sally,

I'm looking forward to start working on the 22nd.  I've arranged to have the
first day orientation as well as PC training on this date, which will last
until about 4:30.

I'm putting together some thoughts on how to best "kick off" my roles and
responsibilities and was wondering if you would be able to meet at 4:30 on
the 22nd to go over this.

I'm available through tomorrow at 713 356 4086 and the rest of the week at
713 628 7570.

Best regards,

Shona

The off-cycle department of the Associate and Analyst program needs your 
help!  

We are looking for volunteer interviewers for the following dates:

Thursday, December 7th from 9:00 a.m. -12:30 p.m.

Over 50 candidates will be interviewing this day.  The candidates will be a 
combination of Associates and Analysts representing schools such as Harvard, 
Princeton, SMU, MIT, University of Illinois, Emory and many others.  Each 
candidate will have 4 interviews.  Pending the outcome of their interviews we 
will invite them to stay and attend Super Saturday that weekend.  If for some 
reason we decide not to further pursue the candidate, we will fly them home 
that Friday morning.

In addition to the interviews on December 7th there will be a breakfast 
buffet from 7:45 a.m. to 8:45 a.m.  and a luncheon from 12:30 p.m. - 2:00

their interviewing date.  The interviewing, breakfast and lunch will take 
place at the Hyatt.  The interviews will be held in the Imperial Ballroom, 
and both breakfast and lunch will be held in the Regency Room.

We are asking Enron employees associate (associates who have been with the 
program for at least one year) level or higher  to volunteer at least ONE 
HOUR to interview candidates (this will be 2 interviews).  If you can 
volunteer for more than an hour or for more than just one of the stated 
dates, that would be great!  Your help is needed!  Please contact my 
assistant, Cathy Lira, at cathy.lira@enron.com or x54049 as soon as possible, 
if you can volunteer any time for interviewing.  Please include the times 
that you can interview and whether or not you will be able to join us for 
breakfast and lunch.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Once again, thanks,
Althea

Tara,

Sally says Todd's London project is under Barry Pearce (related to 
Continental Power) - Barry would need to designate London RC (or James New in 
his absence, since Barry is in Houston).

Regarding the "extra" housing costs, this would need to be charged to Todd's 
RC in Houston, which is #2182.

Please let me know if you require additional information.

Thanks,

Hi, Sally

We may have discussed this already, but I think I have forgotten the answer, 
sorry!!

Which RC in London is taking most of Todd's costs? I have some urgent bills 
to pay and need an RC.

thanks!

By the way, are you coming to London?

Thanks for the update and attachment.  It will be great to have you back here

Ignore this first reply.  I am scheduled for too many PRC meetings, so I had 
my dates confused.  I will get you pre-rankings before the 29th.  You have 
left Brent Price off of the list, a VP who reports to me.  Is Rick Causey 
planning to pre-rank Brent, or does he want me to handle that?  Do your 
records not show that Brent reports to me?  I approved his reviewers in the

12th.  I would prefer to give you that information on the 8th, rather than

Congratulations on your added role of Chairman and CEO of ENA.  I didn't 
realize that when I said hello in the elevator last week that we would be 
seeing more of you in Houston.  I look forward to working with you when you 
arrive.  Congratulations on your new role as Chief Strategy Officer.    Your 
leadership in ENA was appreciated and I will miss your active participation 
in ENA's business.  However, I hope that we will have opportunities to work 
together in the future.  --Sally This makes great sense - glad to have you as a true ENA resource. 


Thanks again for meeting with my expanded staff yesterday.  Let me know how I

I am sorry that I will not be able to join you tonight for dinner and to hear 
Julie Andrews speak.   Tonight is the induction ceremony for the high school 
drill team members for next year, with parents being introduced as well as 
our daughters.  So the place that I most need to be tonight is at Klein High 
School with Meagan.  

Thanks to Mary for arranging the dinner.  I hope that all of you enjoy the 
evening.  

The final speaker in the series is Jane Goodall, and that will be next 
Tuesday, May 16.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions for a spot 
for dinner.   That night is Meagan's 16th birthday, so I have asked her to be 
my guest that evening for dinnner and the lecture.  I can't think of a better 
idea for this birthday than to expose her to a group of very bright, 
motivated women!     I will look forward to introducing her to those of you 
whom she has not yet met.  I heard this morning from Susan Harrison that Sandra had submitted a letter 
of resignation to Bryce Baxter, who reports to Susan.  I have not talked 
directly with Bryce and I have not seen the resignation letter to date this

713-259-8965 I made the assumption when you said that Jim Fallon had said that Kristin's 
name was "in play", that he and Kristin had coordinated a transition with 
Kevin Presto that made him comfortable.  At an ENA offsite meeting on 
Wednesday and Thursday last week, I talked with Kevin during a break to see 
if was comfortable with Kristin's number two as his risk lead.  
Unfortunately, Kevin knew nothing about this.  So rather than discuss the 
transition, Kevin had to react to and absorb this as a possibility.  He had 
some very valid business reasons as to why Kristin's movement over the summer 
months would be risky for ENA.  You and I can discuss those if you would 
like.  His reaction was not "never", but instead was "not now".  He and 
Kristin talked on Friday and agreed to a transition in mid August.  Let's 
discuss.  --Sally

I have been summoned for jury duty onTuesday, November 28 at 8:00 am.  While 
wanting to fulfill my civic duty, I am also hoping to be an unlikely juror 
this time around so that I can be back in the office sometime on Tuesday.  I 
will call in and let Patti know my status.    Amanda is at camp from Sunday, May 28 until Saturday, June 10.  Then Meagan 
leaves on Sunday, June 11 and will return on Saturday, June 24.  If we decide 
to do a family vacation, it would be either the week of June 26, July 3 or 
July 10.  After that, Meagan starts Bearkadette practices through school 
start in August, with a few days at Bearkadette camp July 20-24.  Looks as if 
we will have one girl or the other with us at any point during the summer, 
unless Amanda schedules her Austin visit during one of Meagan's two stints at 
camp.  Let me know when you want to talk dates.

He has been focused on Sitara for a long time.  He reports to Scott Mills, 
who is the user lead for the project.  I am copying Scott on this message, as 
his Sitara team is small and he would know best what deliverables are on the

You have the right earrings -- they are tiny!  But that's what she would 
like.  She will be really pleased.  She loves her silver ones, but they are 
not great for everyday wear -- gold is better for her ears.  

Sounds as if your weekend was fun.  Ours was nice --errands and stuff on

I did talk with Mom on Saturday night about a psychologist vs. psychiatrist.

HI, Sal.  Well, I guess Meagan told you that I went ahead and called her

Subject: Re: Move  

Mark,

It's good to hear from you. Sorry we haven't kept you better informed; I 
didn't realize you were not aware of the situation. 

Richard, Iain and I had agreed that it made sense for me and Iain to overlap 
a week either in London or Houston. Since I had commitments in Houston up 
through last week, we decided to overlap in Houston and for me to start in 
London on May 8th.

Sally Beck then approached us about letting Todd extend his stay in the flat 
an extra week since his project was not wrapping up on schedule and since he 
had his whole family with him, so we offered to push my move back one more 
week, to May 15th.

Todd intended to be out of the flat by Thursday, May 11, but apparently his 
plans included working the last weekend of April. Having lost that weekend 
since the London office was closed in anticipation of May Day riots, he now 
wants to stay until Thursday, May 18.

Originally, he suggested that his family would probably return to the U.S. 
the week of May 8th with or without him, so I had proposed that we finalize 
my plans around his leaving on May 11, and he relocate to a hotel if he 
needed to stay longer. Now, though, his family has decided to stick it out 
with him instead of returning early.

Unless somebody dictates an absolute move-out  date to him, I guess we work 
around his *tentative* plan to vacate the flat by May 18 and we target May 22 
as my start date in London. My only concern though, is that his project may 
continue to drag on day-by-day.

Tara needs two full working days to clean the flat, which means Thursday and 
Friday, which gives me Saturday and Sunday to move in. (Depending on how 
strict "two full working days" is, we may actually need for him to be out no 
later than Wednesday, May 17--or even Wednesday, May 10.)

Cheers,
Tom x33926

Hi there,
Just giving you a heads up that I have submitted an eRequest for vpn.  I have 
been instructed by the Resolutions Desk that I need vpn in order to use cable 
on my home computer.  The eRequest required 2 manager's and a vice president 
to be selected, (not sure if they need all of you to approve).

Thanks,
Avril

Have fun in Wharton -- remember that Hines BBQ is the best bet in town.  
Leave room for the pie!  Let's review calendars so that we can pin point a 
time for you or you and Chris to visit.  ( I will keep that date 
confidential, so that it will be reserved for you.)  --Sally

Hi Clare,

How about:

Tuesday, May 9th 1:30-2:30 PM or 3:00-4:00 PM

Sally has tentative plans to go to Calgary May 10-12, so Tuesday is best for 
her.  If neither of these time slots work, just let me know and I can move 
things around to accommodate James.

See ya,
PattiBarry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within EBS.  Since 
Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him 
in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain 
a mention of the transition:

Example:

 Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS.  He will be 
transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce 
assumes his responsibilities for EBS.  The current trading staff for EBS will 
report to Barry effective with his start date in May.  

I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out 
of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading 
operations and that Barry will report to John Echols.  So sounds as if that 
is clarified.  Barbara,

Will this be at 4:00 PM on Monday?  Sally has meeting w/ Louise Kitchen from 
3:30 to 4:30, so she will probably be 30 mins late to Jeff's meeting.

PattiIt is hard for me to say how this would work on behalf of all of my direct 
reports.  Sometimes it is tough to have all assistants out at once.  To meet 
at 3:00, you all would have to leave around 2:30, which could be early in the 
day for some groups to lose assistants.    Would it work to start a little 
later in the afternoon?  If before 5:00, I think that all assistants will 
have to check with their managers on the convenience of an earlier departure 
time.  --Sally

Hi Sally
Hope you had a great Easter!
Are you okay with us leaving the office early on Wed May 3rd?
Sometimes it is hard for some to break for lunch and others can't do a dinner 
after work.  I thought mtg at 3pm would be inbetween.  And give everyone a 
chance to relax without thinking about coming back to work.
I wanted to check with you before I asked for RSVP's.
Thank you

Hi Ladies,
If you don't know already, Patti Thompson (Sally's Assistant) is now an 
official Enron Employee!!!!  Yeah!!!!!  I couldn't be more pleased and would 
like to arrange a get together to welcome her to our group!  Plus, we haven't 
all gotten together for awhile!  Instead of having lunch or dinner, maybe we 
can meet in between.

 How about this? 
Little Papasito's (on Westhiemer and Kirby) or Tilah's (on West Dallas)
Wednesday, May 3rd
Meet at the restaurant at 3:00pm
There is one thing about this. . . .no returning to the office!
(It hasn't been decided whether to go to Papasito's or Tilah's, place your 
vote!)

I  would love to accommodate as many assistants as possible.  So if this 
conflicts with many of your schedules, we can be flexible on the date.
Please let me know what you think as soon as you can.  I'll keep everyone 
posted!
Lynn



We will look forward to seeing you in Rick Causey's CAO Staff Meeting on May 
9th at 8:30 in EB46C1.  I listened to your voice mail message --thanks for 
the clarification around the recruiting process for one analyst program.  

My dad was released from the hospital on Saturday, following what seemed like 
a very long ten day stay.  He lost a lot of weight while being fed only by IV 
for 8 of those days, so he is under orders to eat everything in sight!  
Hopefully, this most recent operation will result in overall better health 
for him going forward.  Thanks for asking.  --Sally

Charlene:  Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our 
meeting on Wednesday morning.  I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so 
it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.  

Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became 
concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other 
supporters of the program.   Many of those expressing frustration are heavily 
involved in the recruiting process.   It is their commitment to both 
recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting 
talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program. 

I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would 
bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss 
them with you in a constructive manner.  Our intent is continued support and 
improvement of the program.   The meeting took place on March 28 and included 
the following:

 Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU

 Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT  

 Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida

 Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of 
Florida

 Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU

 Carolyn Barrett  EBS    

 Howard Selzer  Enron Global E&P 


Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:

One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an 
announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program.  Not much 
materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be 
managed.  In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw 
that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and 
differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.  We 
feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program 
on campus. 

SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is 
impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an 
innovative company.  The July start date does not consider December graduates 
and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in 
May.  

Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed 
senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or 
communication about the program.   We hear rumors of "tracks", but no facts 
or details.  Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some 
had not.  

Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support 
staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily 
focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.

Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many 
of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join 
with you in some of your plans for the program.   We are concerned that 
decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum 
without what could be some valuable input from some of us.  

MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team 
and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on 
campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top 
candidates and the pride of participants in the program.  We feel that the 
focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and 
we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.  


Summary Concerns/Discussion Points:

Disc   Kim,

Sally says that Wes Colwell will be assigning ENA representative.

Patti
x39106I read the applications, letters of recommendation and resumes on the plane 
to Austin and in the hospital this weekend.  Below are my suggested seven 
appointees to the Analyst Advisory Board.  I made the selections based on 
their answers to the application questions, plus I attended to get a mix of 
male and female, commercial and merchant service analysts rotations, current 
operating company assignments, undergraduate schools, etc.

I am sorry that I will not be able to join you in the meeting today. 


Analyst  School  Current Rotation Rationale

Ilan Caplan  UT   CALME Structuring Both MSA and Commercial Analyst rotations

Erin Rice  Trinity   CALME Structuring Vocal; good to be part of the 
solution; female minority

Brian Hoskins  Vanderbilt  ENA Trading  I will trust Jeff Shankman on this one

Carrie Southard  Texas A&M  ENA - EOL  Current MSA rotation

Alejandro Veiga Rice   ESA - Venezula  Good ideas; diverse background

Courtney Votaw  Pepperdine  Corp. - PR  Adds interest to the mix with her 
rotation & background

Adrian Woolcock Rice   EES   Sounds mature; good ideas  



    I have this on my calendar.  I have jury duty on Tuesday starting at 8:00 
am.  I hope to make that short and sweet and be back here as soon as I 
can.    So I should be able to make the meeting at 4:00.  I will call you if 
I get hung up at the court house.  --Sally

Stephen,

Attached is your latest expense report for your review.  Please let me know 
if any revisions are required.  Thank you.

I do know Susan so I could probably approve this request.  However, in my 
staff meeting on Monday ( I know that Katherine was there, and not you), one 
of the major points that I made centered around my approval of requests for 
EOL access.  We can discuss when we get together on Friday morning.  Susan 
needs to put her managers name at the bottom of this form, and the manager 
should  okay this as well.  --Sally

Subject: 2000 Audit Plan

Weather:  The gross book balance of the Weather Risk book is smallest after 
the winter season (majority of trades roll off in March) and alot of business 
is executed during September.  Although September would probably be OK, it 
may be helpful it the review was moved to June/July.

Pulp, Paper and Lumber-:  Looks OK.

Although it is not ENA, I would recommend a review of EBS  Bandwidth Trading 
for the latter part of the year.  I'm not sure how this would get scheduled.
Please incorporate these changes into the 2000 plan.  Thanks.

We would love to see all three of you.  Sounds as if you might arrive on 
Friday around 5:00 or 6:00, so we will plan on dinner together.  You can see 
the kitchen in progress!!  The upstairs is untouched, however, so you can 
make yourselves at home.  I will let everyone know tonight, and they will all 
be glad to see you.  

I haven't talked with Cara since the weekend, so I didn't know that she might 
change her plans.  I will try to catch her tonight.  

Just let me know on the $'s.  I can send that whenever you might need it.  
And I would suggest that we start a repay program after another few months as 
you all get caught up on other things.  No rush.  

Love, Sally I tried to call you back today, but was told that you had left the office.  
Tried to leave you a voice mail message, but no one in the office knew how to 
transfer my call into voice mail.  They were good about answering your phone, 
however! 

I will call you tomorrow morning before my first meeting at 8:30.  If I miss 
you, I will ask my assistant to interrupt me when you call back.  I will be 
in meetings with operations people from London and Sydney tomorrow, but can 
easily step out to talk with you.  Please incorporate the management contact changes per Sheila Glover for the 
2000 plan.

Sally,

I wanted to give you a quick update.

I met with Fernley last Friday and we had a good discussion.  He wanted to 
know my initial assessment of the project and a rough time-line.  I admire 
the fact that he took almost 30 minutes of his time to show his interest in 
this project and myself.  I told him that it would be prudent for me to 
return a month after implementation of the book splits.  This way I can 
ensure that the processes and tools are in place and used by both the traders 
and the support staff.  If Brent needs some assistance at that time, I could 
stay for a 2-week span and meet two needs on one trip.

I spoke to Mark Tawney today and he welcomes my support on the weather desk.  
When I asked Mark about the impact of the traders leaving, he said that they 
are probably trading even more.  Tim Norton is meeting with Mark today and 
assuming things go well, he could began training almost immediately.

I'll try to call you tomorrow,
Todd

Fall sounds good to me.  In talking with Sue today, she stated that Dr. Rao 
would like to inform the winners of the scholarships by letter from him and 
that it will most likely be another week before he does so.  I asked her to 
contact me when the letter is going out to the students so that we can follow 
up with either a letter or phone call from some of us at Enron.  I will keep 
Rick Causey, the other interviewers and you (or someone in your office) 
updated on the timing of notifying the winners.  --Sally

Hi Elyse - I just spoke with Ramesh Rao (associate dean).  He has not yet
made the Excellence Fund awards, which are also part of the Enron endowment.
He would like to have the dinner in the fall, when all of the awardees have
been chosen.  He felt that a dinner the end of April would conflict with a
major E-commerce conference we're having here, and the Enron awards would
get the attention they deserve in the fall.  The other advantage of a fall
dinner is that the new students will be here, and if we have a big
announcement then, they can see what they have to look forward to.  Will
this work for you?  Thanks.  Sue

Sue:  Thanks for your email.  In speaking with Rick Causey, the only day
that he is available is Monday, April 24.  In speaking with Sally Beck, I
know that you are confirming the 3 winners and will get me their info once
they have been chosen.  If you don't mind seeing who from the university is
available on the 24th, that would be great.  Our other option is to have it
another evening that week or rescheduling for the fall after classes begin.

As I mentioned before, I am expecting a baby two weeks from today, so I'd
love to have as much of this wrapped up before I pass it on to someone else
on my team.

Thanks for your help!
Elyse









The scholarships, while sponsored by Enron, are technically awarded by UT.  I 
will be talking with Sue White today, and I will get her take on whether or 
not the university wants to contact the winners or whether Enron should do 
it.  I will let you know.  

The 24th is a great day for me for the dinner in Austin.  So if that works 
for recepients and faculty, then that would work our well.  Keep me posted.

Thanks, Sally, for the update.  The only day that Rick is available is 
Monday, April 24 - this definitely limits us! I've asked Sharron to find out 
if others can't make it on the 24th (the recipients, Dean May, interviewers), 
would he rather have it on another day that week without him or have it in 
the fall once school starts again. Sharron will let me know what Rick says 
today.  Then, I'll call Sue White to start getting the ball rolling with 
schedules on campus.  I've tentatively booked Jeffrey's private room again 
for the 24th.

Do you want me to notify the winners?  I'm happy to do so.

Elyse

We interviewed the 12 finalists in Austin yesterday.   Interviewers were Gene 
Humphrey, Thomas Suffield, Roger Ondrecko and me.  The four of us met this 
morning in Houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients.  Based 
on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today 
with the names of the three suggested award winners.  I conveyed this via 
voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.  She had told me that her schedule 
would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow 
morning.  She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.  I would not 
anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue.  
However, I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients 
until after that conversation.  She will most likely then contact you to 
confirm their names.  I have phone numbers, addresses and e:mail addresses 
for all three, and I will provide you with those as soon as the official 
notification from the University takes place.  

Gene, Thomas and Roger are all interested in attending the dinner in Austin 
if schedules permit.  The week of April 24th is a good one for me for the 
dinner.  Obviously, many schedules have to be coordinated.  I know that Rick 
Causey will want to attend (he will have been in London the week prior, so he 
may be available).  I have also talked with CIndy Olson and I know that she 
would like to be included if her schedule permits.  

Today was Brent's last day in the Houston office for several months.  Let me 
know how I can help with these arrangements.

Sue:  Greetings!  We have not spoken in awhile, but I wanted to touch base 
with you regarding the MBA Excellence Awards and specifically hosting a 
dinner similar to last year's event at Jeffrey's.  I am expecting a baby in 
two weeks, so I'd like to get as much of this planned now as possible!  Amy 
Lee, Charla Stuart and Ali Saler who work in my group will pick up any of the 
pieces that I don't get to prior to becoming a mom, and one of them will 
attend the dinner in Austin.

I have a number of questions:  First, have the award winners been chosen?  
notified? What are their names/phone numbers? Can you help us with the guest 
list from the university?  How does the week of April 24 look on the 
university's calendar?  If we can't find a date before the school year ends, 
we could have the dinner during the beginning of the fall semester, but I'd 
like to try for the end of April/beginning of May.

I would like to use the Josephine House at Jeffrey's Restaurant again - it 
worked well last year, but I haven't called them yet - waiting to hear 
answers to the questions above...

Have a great day!  I can be reached by email or phone at 713-853-0565.

Thanks!

Subject: Junior Achievement & Enron

Cliff Baxter is representing Enron on the Board of Junior Achievement.  One 
of the programs that he would like to continue at Enron is the Job Shadow 
program.  This program entails a half-day commitment once per month beginning 
with the fall school semester.  The high school students are first given an 
overview of Enron and then a tour of the building.  The students then spend 
approximately 1-1/2 hours directly with individuals within specific 
departments.  Cliff would like to have as many departments as possible 
participate since this may be the only exposure these students have to the 
business world.

Please advise if you are willing to have your department participate, who 
your contact person is, and how many students that you would like to host 
each time.

Thank you for your consideration.

Susan

list from the university?  How does the week of April 24 look on the 
university's calendar?  If we can't find a date before the school year ends, 
we could have the dinner during the beginning of the fall semester, but I'd 
like to try for the end of April/beginning of May.

I would like to use the Josephine House at Jeffrey's Restaurant again - it 
worked well last year, but I haven't called them yet - waiting to hear 
answers to the questions above...

Have a great day!  I can be reached by email or phone at 713-853-0565.

Thanks!

I will look forward to meeting you during your visit to Houston next week.  I 
will work with Carol to schedule a time that will work for both of us.  Have 
a nice flight.  --Sally

I will be in Houston next week and was wondering if you could spare me some 
time to talk about the back office for Australia. I am the CFO in Sydney and 
am currently running the settlements work done down here and I would also 
like to go over the results of the audit. 

At the moment I have time available both on Wed and Thursday and would 
appreciate it if we could meet up on either of those days if you are 
available. (AC Romero in Cassandra Schultz's office is co-ordinating my 
schedule). Carol Howes and I are meeting with Harry Bucalo on tuesday to look 
at weather settlements issues so we can also address the related control 
issues for this new product if that is convenient. 

Thanks

Heidi

Glad you enjoyed the game.   It was certainly a panoramic view from up 
there!  I am that you continue to be pleased with your decision to come to 
Enron, and I am  certainly glad that you are here.

I just wanted to say thanks for the Astros tickets.  My wife and I enjoyed 
seeing the ballpark and watching the game.  I am really enjoying my work here

I think I made the right decision to come to Enron, I say yes without

Thank you for the tickets to the Saturday game. My wife and I enjoyed it very 
much. We were unable to sit in the Upper Level in the seats ticketed. My wife 
and I came to the fourth level to identify the seats. When we arrived, my 
wife became dizzy as she does in most high places. We watched the game from 
the walkway at level one and were able to enjoy the game. Thanks again for 
the tickets. Enron Field is a nice ballpark.

Per my voice mail message, attached is a draft memo regarding Brent's role in

I'm in Helsinki  this week so time difference is 9 hours.


Energy Operations has two sets of season tickets for Astros games this 
season.  One set is four tickets in the field box level, and the other set is 
two tickets in the terrace level.  I have also purchased one parking spot in 
a lot that is a couple of blocks from the stadium.  I have divided the 
tickets among you, with my husband's help.  He identified "good games" (i.e. 
teams that everyone likes to see), and those are distributed equally across 
my direct reports.  Tickets for the other games have been distributed based 
your percentage of Energy Operations employees.  For most games, you will 
receive all six tickets.  You can use these tickets for yourself and for a 
small reward for a job well done by someone in your group.  The parking 
information will accompany the group of four field box tickets.  Patti is 
including a map of downtown with the parking lot pinpointed.  Your tickets 
will be distributed to you this week.  I hope that you and your staff will 
enjoy these.  

I also received over 100 tickets from Cliff Baxter, Greg Whalley and Dave 
Delainey for the exhibition game on Saturday, April 1.  I have chosen to 
distribute two tickets a piece to all directors and managers in Energy 
Operations who are not my direct reports.  SInce you will have first call on 
the season tickets going to your group, I thought that it would be nice to 
make these tickets available to the next tier of leadership.  I wanted to 
make you aware of this before these are distributed tomorrow.  

Finally, I have purchased a block of tickets for two upcoming games, one a 
weekday afternoon and one a weekend.  I will let you know these dates soon, 
as I would like for my direct report group to join me at these games. Approved.  Please note that Co. # should be 0342 for Misc. Expense on

Sally,

If you don't mind, I'd like to leave early today (2 or 3 pm) to pick up Scott 
(my son) at the airport.  He went to Denver to visit his sister for spring 
break & was scheduled to come back Monday evening.  Unfortunately, due to 
winter storm, all flights were cancelled Monday & most of Tuesday.  I wasn't 
able to get him a flight back until this morning.  Scott, however, was not 
too disappointed in missing 3 days of school (instead of 1 that we planned).  
Anyway, if it's okay with you, I will let your direct reports know that Irena 
will have numbers where they can reach you.

Subject: Re: Cross calibration for Operations people globally  

I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be 
held in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be 
held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC 
meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary 
due to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed 
in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  

The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM 
and EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior 
Specialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review 
meetings mirror the "preferred distribution", which as you probably know 
suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should 
therefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work 
has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not 
be too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the 
managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good 
jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing 
suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I 
still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss 
my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of 
course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels 
that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my 
direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda 
Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to 
attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  

Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this 
year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the 
year to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in 
Houston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would 
make sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.

I have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about

which raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross 
calibration done by yourself. Can I ask what are the plans?

create  a job description to be used to search for a local candidate in 
Japan?  Do you need a job description for internal purposes to create a 
position on the Tokyo team?  Is this a job description that you want to use 
in discussions that we may have with Eugenio Perez in a start up role for the

this.

Please find attached the final draft of the Sydney/Singapore presentations 
for you review and distribution.  Thank you.




Ted Murphy, Tom Bauer, Jim Brown and I met yesterday to schedule the next 
series of operations/controls reviews of Enron offices or certain companies 
in which Enron holds an ownership interest.   Attached is a copy of that 
schedule.  Please contact Ted or me if you have any questions.  You will note 
that the full make-up of the teams is being worked on currently.  We have 
identified the lead on each review, however, from RAC, Operations and AA.  

 I will be out of the office Wednesday through Friday, March 15-17 to be with 
my children during part of their spring break.  We will be in town, so I can 
be reached either at home (281-370=8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591).  
I will check voice mail messages during this time period, but probably once 
or twice a day.  

I will be in the London office next week.  I will be in that office from 
about noon on Monday through the end of the day on Thursday.  Patti will have 
a schedule of my appointments while I am there, and she will have an 
international cell phone number that I will have with me throughout the 
trip.  Contact her if you need to speak directly with me.  I will be 
responding to voice mail frequently throughout the week.  I will be 
travelling back to Houston on Friday, March 24 (leaving my hotel in London 
around 1 AM Houston time).  

I will see you back in the office on Monday, March 27.  The e:mail system never recognizes Rick Causey, so you were dropped from the 
first distribution.  I have to remember to type your full first name!

I'll look forward to seeing you.  Since my first note, I have scheduled a 
dinner with Richard Sage on Thursday evening - the only time that he and I 
can meet, since he is in Helsinki through Wednesday, in the office on 
Thursday but booked that day.  With the Tuesday dinner with Fernley, that 
leaves Monday or Wednesday.  I hope that one of those days works for you and 
Frank.  I will try to call Mo - I think that she is still in Houston today.

Subject: Dinner Next Week

Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week.  Wanted to see if 
you, Frank and Mo might be available for dinner one evening.  We arrive on 
Monday morning (March 20th) and will return to Houston on Friday morning.   
Our Tuesday night is booked, having dinner with Fernley.  But Monday, 
Wednesday and Thursday are available.  Does it work for you with the baby to 
do evenings?  Let me know.  




1)  I just talked with Scott Earnest and asked him to send you and John 
Sherriff copies of the lastest draft of the report on Singapore.  This draft 
now incorporates comments from Bill Bradford that were pending last week (he 
made the trip to Sydney and Singapore, but had to be in New York last week, 
meaning his imput was delayed until yesterday.  You and John should receive 
those drafts today.  

2)  I sent an e:mail message to John Sherriff after you and I talked, simply 
to clarify the several purposes of my trip to London (since you said he was 
asking).  I have scheduled a brief meeting one-on-one with him while I am 
there.    

3)  To outline for you the primary points on my agenda for the week, they are 
the following:

Iron out with you the trading operations support that Brent and I can provide 
for you during this transition period
Finalize details with Tara Rozen on work permits, accomodations and all of 
the details on having support personnel in London 

Map out with you how we can provide training, orientation and contacts for 
Michael Jordan when he arrives to help make his assimilation a smooth one 
(which as you and I discussed, may involved a short stint in Houston)

Meet with you, Barry, Richard Sage and anyone else that you feel is 
appropriate to collect their ideas on working collectively on effective 
trading operations and controls world-wide

I look forward to seeing you next week.  I have attached a listing of planned PRC meetings for Operations that will be 
held in Houston.  There will be a number of pre-review meetings that will be 
held over the next two weeks in preparation for an Energy Operations PRC 
meeting to be held on Friday, December 8th.  The pre-meetings are necessary 
due to the sheer size of the groups.  (In addition to the meetings detailed 
in this schedule, Brent's team in EGM is having pre-meetings as well.)  

The December 8th meeting will include all operations personnel from ENA, EGM 
and EIM.  We will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior 
Specialists and below.  I have asked that the results from the pre-review 
meetings mirror the "preferred distribution", which as you probably know 
suggests that 15% of the population will not receive a bonus and should 
therefore be in the bottom two categories.  Assuming that appropriate work 
has been done at the pre-review meetings, this review on the 8th should not 
be too lengthy.  We will take considerably more time as we review the 
managers, who will have been pre-ranked as well.  This will give us a good 
jumping off point for the cross calibration discussions.  We will then review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  We will also be discussing 
suggested promotions during this meeting as well.  Finally, assuming that I 
still have David Oxley and Wes Colwell captive and attentive, I will discuss 
my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me.  (We will of 
course pare down the list of attendees as we move up the ladder on levels 
that we are reviewing -- initial make up of the December 8th PRC is me and my 
direct reports within ENA, Brent and his direct reports within EGM and Brenda 
Herod from EIM.)  I have also extended an invitation to Louise Kitchen to 
attend the December 8th meeting.  I do not know yet if she will attend.  

Do you have some suggestions for cross-calibrating on a global basis this 
year?  I think that next year we can put some plans in place early in the 
year to help facilitate this.  Would you like to attend the meeting here in 
Houston on December 8th?  Is there a planned meeting in London that would 
make sense for me to attend?  Let me know your thoughts.  

   

    -Sally

Subject: Cross calibration for Operations people globally

Sally

I have been speaking to Cindy Horn ( works for Scott here in London ) about 
checking ratings / promotions across the two groups in London ( EGM and EEL ) 
which raised concerns that this might duplicate some work done on cross 
calibration done by yourself. Can I ask what are the plans?

Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday 
morning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in 
regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick 
Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will 
provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during 
the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has 
hired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the 
details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will 
also map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, 
which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a 
strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with 
Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael 
in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as 
possible.  

Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his  
business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we 
would commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good 
ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron 
locations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were 
focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on 
leveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading 
operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be 
generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  

I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as 
she moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but 
I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.  
It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in 
Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading 
operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.  
I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and 
offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role 
over Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as 
needed.  

I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to 
discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your 
business efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  

This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are 
conducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have 
taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be 
a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.  
The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of 
North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a 
large ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort 
in London will occur in mid April.  

Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to 
Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those 
drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business 
managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley 
suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final 
copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and 
Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip 
in London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned 
the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I 
can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was 
pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was 
out of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney 
and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to 
accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They 
understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.  

 I didn't get a response from you regarding my e:mail that I sent last week, 
but I have heard through the grapevine that you will be making a trip to 
Houston next week.  My plans for being in London next week are firm, so it 
looks as if we will miss one another.  

My offer stands to help you in any way as you take on your new role, so I 
trust that you will take me up on that offer as needed.  I will look forward 
to working with you as we develop common standards for operations worldwide, 
with effective exception reporting.  This is a key initiative for 2000 and 
will involve trading operations in all locations for all commodities.  
I have asked my assistant Patti to help me in setting up meetings for next 
week and I had asked her to arrange  a lunch with you and Brent, plus some 
time for just the two of us to get together.  

We are continuing the worldwide operations/controls review at the request of 
the two Rick's (Causey and Buy).  That will include a look at Continental 
power, UK power, UK gas and global products.  Looks as if sometime in April 
will be the date for that, however, not next week.  --Sally

I have two options available below. I have not seen these apartments, 
however, so would recommend that you both have a look when you arrive next 
week. Please let me know if you find these suitable. Neither of them are 
located in South Kensington or Chelsea but I think you will find that 
Kensington and Marylebone are also very nice, close to parks and high 
streets, etc.   Also, is Fernley the person from whom I should seek approval 
for costs of accommodation and per diems or is Houston picking up these 
charges?

Kensington High Street - We have a block of apartments here that offer
accommodation of a high standard. They will have a newly  refubished
spacious flat free with 3 bathrooms, 24 hour porterage, Mon-Fri maid
service, and an underground car parking space included.

Please however note that this flat will not be free until the 03rd or 04th
of April.

OR

Baker Street W1 - Spacious 3 bedroom flat in porteraged block close to the
station. This flat has been newly decorated and re-carpeted throughout. One
double bedroom with bathroom ensuite and 2 bedrooms with 2 single beds in
each. Fully equipped kitchen and comfortable lounge.

We are working on the details of Todd's accomodations.  I view this as a 
business trip on which we are allowing him to bring his family.  ENA is 
picking up the cost associated with the family.  Sounds as if I need to make 
sure we moderate expectations on those accomodations, but we will get that 
handled. 

That is great that Edith will be in London for part of Todd's stay.  

Your notes ask for Astros tickets for Wed., April 10th.  Monday is actually 
the 10th; Wednesday is the 12th.  The Astros play St. Louis on both of those 
days., both evening games.  I would be happy to give you four tickets for 
either one of those games.  Just let me know whether you actually want the 
10th or the 12th.  

We will definitely plan to get together while you are here in April.  I would 
love to see Jo as well.  We will have to work the details.  I am planning to 
be in London next week, arriving the morning of the 20th (Monday) and staying 
through Thursday, so we should see one another before April.  I am working on 
an agenda right now for next week, so I will be back in touch within the next 
day or so to confirm some time with you there.  --Sally

To recap.

1. I think Todd is going to be here on 25th March. HR eare sorting out 
accomodation for one month. Europe pay his costs, NA pick up family costs.

2. Spoke to Bernie A - Edith is going to be here for a week in the middle of 
Todd's month.

3. I'll be in Houston w/c 8th April - lets get together then for an update. 
Though I believe you may be here sooner than that?

4. Astros' - any chance of tickets for Wed 10th (v St Louis). I guess - to be 
extra cheeky - can I have 4 - to take Jo and kids? No problem if that's not 
possible.

Talk soon.

Attached is a referral and resume on an HR professional that I thought might 
interest you.  The referral comes from James Scribner, a guy that has just 
accepted a job offer from me.  James and I worked together previously at a 
bank, and he is very discerning in his evaluation of talent.  When I asked if 
he knew of any other talented people at Fleming (his current employer) that 
we should know, he immediately suggested Tana.  His read is that she is very 
bright, creative, and innovative.  She has worked on many special projects at 
Fleming, but James believes that she would certainly consider a generalist 
role as she learned Enron and would then "earn" her way into managing special 
projects.  I thought that I would give ENA a first look at this candidate.  
If you are not interested or do not have a need, please pass this referral 
along to other HR groups.  

FYI - James will start work here on April 3.

global risk management operations.Attached is the list of PRC meetings that will cover operations for ENA, EIM 
and EGM.  Location, times and attendees are listed for each meeting.  There 
are five pre-review meetings that will take place starting today through 
December 5 in preparation for the Energy Operations PRC meeting that will be 
held on Friday, December 8.  I invite you to sit in on any or all of these 
meetings if you would like to do so.  

The most meaningful meeting will be on  December 8th.  In that meeting, we 
will review the results from the pre-review meetings for Senior Specialists 
and below.  I would anticipate that if at each pre-review meeting the 
preferred distribution is met as instructed, then this portion of the meeting 
will not take too long.  We will then review in more detail the managers, who 
will have been pre-ranked in the pre-review meetings.  We will also review 
and rank the directors and senior directors.  I can also be prepared to 
review my suggested rankings for the three VP's who report to me, with you, 
Wes Colwell and David Oxley in attendance.  

Call me if you have any questions.  --Sally 



   FYI - This should make things easier in London as there will be one point 
person to focus on global.  I am not sure that her background will bring a 
lot to the table in the early stages, but she did seem sharp when I met with 
her last week.  This announcement did surprise me a bit, as when I last 
talked with Fernley he was not leaning in the direction of utilizing Tani in 
this role.  ---Sally

I would definitely talk with Wes Colwell about doing the presentation on 
Business Analysis & Reporting.  I think that he would do a great job!  Please share this info with Mom and Dad:

Hotel: Hotel Royal Plaza (with Klein High School Bearkadettes) 
 
Phone:  (407) 828-2828

Air Travel: Miami Air charter leaving IAH at 4:30 PM on Thursday, March 2

  Miami Air charter leaving Orlando at 4:30 PM on Monday, March 6Hotel in Orlanda: Thursday PM through Monday AM
   Hotel Royal Plaza
   Phone:  407-828-2828

Flight is charter on Miami Air, leaving IAH at about 4:30PM on March 2 
(Thursday), and returning about 6:30 PM to IAH on March 6 (Monday).  

I do not plan on checking messages, so if something critical comes up, please 
leave me a message at the hotel.  We are there with the Klein High School 
Bearkadettes, in case you need to know that to get a message to me.  Thanks for making the arrangements in Boerne!  It's interesting to know that 
the mustard men are real and not just a made up story for tourists.
I am glad that I avoided them!  The responsibility for granting access to the DPR and associated reports 
available through the Executive Viewer on line is being shifted from Scott 
Tholen's team to my operations team.   (This makes a lot of sense, since it 
is our group that prepares all of these reports.)  Fernley Dyson has 
requested access to this information via the Executive Viewer.  In insuring a 
tight distribution list for these reports, please let me know via return 
e:mail or voice mail (x35926) that you would like for Fernley to have access 
to the Enron-wide DPR.  Thanks. I will be out of the office on vacation on Thursday, Friday and Monday, March 
2, 3, and 6th.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106) will have
telephone and fax numbers for the hotel where I will be staying.  I will be 
at Disneyworld with my family and 90 members of my daughter's high
school drill team, so it is not likely that I will be available during the 
daytime.  However, I can be contacted at the hotel in the evening, if 
needed.  

While I am out, please contact the following for any operational needs: 

 Brent Price   Business Controller for Natural Gas  x37647

 Kristin Albrecht *   Business Controller for Power   x34763


*  Kristin will be in the office in the morning only on March 6: she will be 
in route to Portland in the afternoon.  


I will be back in the office on Tuesday, March 7.    ---------------------- Forwarded by Sally Beck/HOU/ECT on 02/29/2000 02:09 PM

If they are still employed (presuming all but Ilkka are still on the payroll) 
then I believe this should be requested.  As a matter of principal it should 
have been done for all in the first place and there should be no reason why 
it could not be done now.  Admittedly the reasons will now be obvious for the 
request, we can simply tell those checked that it was overlooked originally.  
Relative to Ilkka, there is no harm in requesting it as well.  Presuming he 
won't consent then we can discuss further.

Subject: Background Checks

I have made contact with the security folks in Houston and been advised of 
what we need to do.  One obvious point is to understand the legal aspects of 
such a check.  I have now spoken to a Finnish lawyer who has advised that any 
employee background check (to include credit checks and bank checks) must 
have the prior written approval of the employee concerned and this would need 
to be provided to the source of the information before it is handed over.

I assume we need to re-think whether we want to go down this route given that 
this check process will now have a very visible profile in the Helsinki 
office.

What are your views?

Joe, Mike and Kent

Thank you again for your offices' assistance  when we visited last week.

I have attached the drafts of the Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires reports.  Please 
review and let me know 
any comments or questions.  We are trying to finalize the reports as soon as 
possible so your response
is greatly appreciated.

Regards
Kate Agnew


Ted Murphy and I met with the Arther Andersen team this morning that 
accompanied us on our trip to Buenos Aires.  We reviewed the observations and 
recommendations in written form that we had discussed briefly with you on our 
last day your office.  After making a few changes, AA should be forwarding to 
you a copy of the draft document later this afternoon.   We would welcome 
your comments and your additions on anything that you think we may have 
missed.  Ted and I will be meeting with Rick Causey and Rick Buy within the 
next couple of days to discuss our operations and control review, so your 
responses would be welcomed prior to that meeting.  

I look forward to working with you and others in your office in my role over 
Global Risk Management Operations.  In addition to overseeing common 
standards and controls for opeartional practices, I will work as your 
advocate for system and resource needs in order to insure success for your 
business plan in Buenos Aires.  Ted Murphy and I met this morning with the Arthur Andersen team that 
accompanied us to Sao Paulo.  We reviewed a summary of our observations and 
recommendations as a result of our visit.  After a few suggested changes, AA 
should forward a copy of this draft to you via e:mail later today.  We would 
welcome your comments on the document, and input on anything that you think 
we may have missed.  Ted and I will be reviewing this information with Rick 
Buy and Rick Causey as soon as a meeting can be scheduled, so your prompt 
comments or feedback would be welcomed.  My travel lately has not allowed time to interview.  Gretchen Jennings in HR 
is supposed to be setting up interviews with appropriate candidates for me.  
She has a stack of all of the resumes that either I have received or those 
that responded to the posting.  I hope to start interviewing next week, 
although I will only be in the office Monday through Wednesday.  Feel free to 
move forward with whatever you need to do.  I trust that I will have several 
good candidates to consider, and Patti is doing a great job, also.  I need to 
find out if she would like to  be considered for the fulltime position.  Is this what you have from AA as a format/information that they are

Sally,

The following attachment is the latest example of the "Curve Validation 
Summary" that we have in "soft copy" form.
We do have several, more recent, hard copies of the curve validation summary, 
but we felt that this attachment would better facilitate you.




Sincerely, 

Jack Ehrig
Peggy Hedstrom will be out of the office from March 1 - 11 for vacation. Our 
spring break week is March 13, so I have sent Peggy a note asking about 
sometime the week of March 20 or 27.  I will let you know her reply and then 
I would love to do a joint trip!

What a good idea.  I am in Canada today because of some changing of the guard 
that needed to take place.  Could be persuaded to come with you when you 
return.

Wanda

I have not been able to schedule a review with Peggy yet, as I am still 
trying to schedule a trip to Calgary so that Peggy and I can do her review.  
She will be out of town from March 1 through March 11, so I will have to come 
to Calgary sometime after March 11.  I was in South America last week, and 
have been to London and Helsinki twice since mid-January, so scheduling 
reviews is a challenge this time around.  I will certainly get you a signed 
copy of the review as soon as I can. Clare,

Barry left me voicemail saying 1:30-2:30 pm would probably be okay - I will 
tentatively put that in Sally's calendar.  We can change later if need be.

Thanks,
PattiBarry,
Sally asked me to forward this to you FYI.  A lot of people will be tied up 
all day Feb 29 at this offsite.  She would, however, like to set up time to 
meet with you in Houston on Wednesday, March 1.  Sally is available from 1:30 
- 5:00 in the afternoon.  Please let me know if there is a one hour slot that 
will work for you.

Thanks,
Patti Thompson x39106

I have just spoken with Barry about arranging a visit for him to Houston.  He 
mentioned the week of 28 February being good for him.  I hope this will suit 
you and wonder if it will be possible to arrange any meetings with him on the 
Tuesday 29 Feb and Wednesday  1 March? I will book for him to arrive on the 
Monday and leave Houston on the Thursday.

Kind regards
Clare.


Another FAS 133 Offsite meeting has been scheduled for Tuesday, Feb 29 (all 
day).  Sally asked me to forward this to you - would like you to attend if at 
all possible.  Scott, this is an FYI for you - I know you will be overseas on 
this date.

Greetings.

Attached is the Argentine gas process flow, which has been under review for 
the past month or so by Mike Guerriero, his staff in BA and my group in 
Houston.   The Southern Cone trading support is based off of this model, so 
it also applies to power in BA and SP.   I do have process flows for power in 
both places, but I would like to revisit them prior to distribution.   If you 
would like them regardless, just let me know and I will pass them along asap.

I hope you have a successful trip.   Please let me know how I can be of 
help.   I am curious to hear your findings.

Thanks for this info.  I will call the students this week.  With your notes, 
it looks as if we may be on target in terms of acceptances and the desired 
number of 6.  Keep me posted on what we hear from the students.  --Sally

FYI - I had included Diane Seib and Melinda Whalen (from Calgary) in my 
promotion memo from Energy Operations.  I believe that they both work under 
Peggy Hedstrom in operational roles.  I am sure that they didn't mind having 
their names included twice in promotional memos!  

Peggy says that you and Juanita are headed to Calgary next week, and she 
wondered if I would be coming.  I will be in South America in what should be 
summer there.  I do plan to make a trip to Calgary soon.  In addition to 
other things that Peggy and I have to cover, I plan to host a happy hour in 
Calgary to honor Peggy's promotion and Diane and Melinda, also.  I hosted a 
happy hour in Houston for Energy Operations employees who were promoted last 
week, and I wanted to do the same thing for the three in Calgary.  I won't be able to join Wanda and Juanita in Calgary next week.  I will find 
myself in South America next week, in Sao Paolo and Buenos Aires.  Should be 
interesting, but a long flight.  I am cross referencing my calendar with your 
vacation days, and I will get back with you later today on a suggested date 
for a trip north.  Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director, a promotion that is 
very well deserved.  I follow your career within Enron with interest.  Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director.  That makes all of the 
life juggling seem a little more worthwhile, doesn't it?!Congratulations on your promotion to Senior Director, a promotion that is

Thanks for keeping me posted on this.  Do let me know if there are further

be sent to all US employees of ENA.  ENA by definition includes Canada and 
Mexico.  Therefore, please send the memo to all ENA employees, not just those 
in the US.  Several of those referenced in the memo as being promoted work in 
our Calgary office, so the memo should certainly be sent to those employees 
in Calgary.  I am at x35926 if you have any questions.  Please distribute attached memo to all Enron North America employees.  If you

this.  My current e:mail address is sally.beck@enron.com, as suggested within 
the past few months by the technology group that all addresses use the long 
name.   HOWEVER, my e:mail address prior to that was sbeck@ect.enron.com.  
That was printed on my business cards, many of which are still in circulation 
I am sure.  When ECT became ENA, I changed my e:mail address to drop the ect 
reference and to use my long name rather than sbeck.  So I can see why you 
would receive my mail on occassion if someone is either making an educated 
guess on the address or referencing my old card.  SInce there are at least 2 
sbeck's here, have you thought about adopting use of your long name address 
rather than the shorter version to help in further differentiating between 
us?   That might help eliminate confusion going forward.  Thanks for the note.  While most of my focus will be on ENA, it will be 
interesting to look at operations around the world. Please find out location of this conference call and put the details on my 
calendar.  Thanks. --

with regard to global operations.  I shared this in the staff meeting so that 
you would be the first to know.  I will still fulfill my role within ENA as 
VP of Energy Operations.  I will not be going away!  This expanded 
responsibility should create addtional opportunities for operations personnel

Subject: Future EOL Weekly Meetings

Please cancel all future EOL weekly meetings from your calendars.   Should 
you have any questions regarding EOL, please feel free to contact either the 
Help Desk at x3-4357 or any of the Product Controls Group.

Thank you for your participation in previous meetings.

Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  It is wonderful to 
see your contributions recognized in that way!  --Sally Congratulations on your new role in the communciations company.  Building 
that business will be exciting and how great for the company that you will be 
there!  Attached is a memo that Rick plans to send out - I hope that attaching this 
makes it easy for you to take care of this.  I am delivering to him a 
highlighted copy of the memo so that he will know about a few wording changes 
that I have made since the last time that he saw this in draft form.  He is 
certainly free to make any other changes before it goes out.  Call me with 
any questions.  
John and I haven't talked about this need, but I will certainly think about 
any likely candidates.  Danny Clark, who used to work in Deal Clearing & 
Documentation for ECT a couple of years ago, is in EES as far as I know.  He 
was knowledgeable and meticulous, understood trading as he was a risk book 
administrator in a previous life.  Have you considered him?  Give me a couple 
of days to think about potential candidates from within ENA, and I will get 
back with you.  --Sally

Subject: Confirm desk

Well, we're a few years behind you, but one of my goals is to set up a 
confirm desk for EES.  John Echols told me he gave you a call to see whether 
there were any candidates from your shop for whom this might be an 
opportunity.  Please let me know if  any background or perspective would be 
helpful. 
thanks. 

This includes OU and UT -- you can ignore the OU names, but there are some 
good students that I can introduce you to when they arrive!

Cecilia, pls forward attachment. Thx.I believe that we may have a potentially good fit for Avril, but my direct 
report who would have to add her to his staff is on vacationing out of town 
until Monday.  I will talk with him on Monday morning and I will have him 
visit with Jeff Sorenson, who previously interviewed Avril (he liked her and 
was favorably impressed, but had no position for her).  We may then want to 
be able to talk with Avril by phone, since a face-to-face interview will not 
be possible.  We should have a decision then very early in the week.  Since 
you will be in Houston I can update you in person.  I would not panic!  Could there be other counterparties that have the same concern as Hess?  You 
will have to explain to me what the issue was.  Thanks.  --Sally

Talked to Steve a few minutes ago.  We will adjust our process as necessary 
to allow Hess to aggregate trades on a daily basis.  I do not know the reason 
we stopped doing this but we will revert back to the old process.  Let me 
know if you need anything else.

I received  a phone call from Steve Semlitz who runs Hess Trading in New 
York.  He is frustrated with the new way he is dealing with settlement post 
the introduction of EOL.  In that now we do not allow him to aggregate.  
Please give him a call and find a way to resolve his problem.

Subject: Houston Analyst North America Presentation

Sally, Attached are two draft slides that we wish to include in the analyst 
presentation. I am hoping that you will be able to coordinate the extraction 
of the data necessary to complete the slides.

The slides are basically maps of our power and gas operations but surrounded 
with some hard data on particular aspects of the business to demonstrate our 
scope and size. I would suggest that the maps are printed out and you will 
then easily see the data we require and the format we wish to use to present 
it. However , in summary the information needed is:

GAS
Storage Capability, Leased and Owned
Number of Counterparties - 1997, 1998, 1999
Contract type by customer in  %  - I have segregated by Industrials, LDCs, 
and Other, but I am open for  better suggestions
Transport contracts - bcf/d - firm and Interruptible, 
Term of contracts  - I suggested ,<1 year,< 10years, >10years  but again am 
open for more appropriate terms
Peak daily deliveries - Btue/d - 1997, 1998, 1999

POWER
Contract type by customer in  %  - I have segregated by Marketers, Utilities 
and Other, but I am open for  better suggestions
Term of contracts  - I suggested ,<1 year,< 10years, >10years  but again am 
open for more appropriate terms
Number of counterparties -1996,1997, 1998, 1999

If there is data that you or your team believe is more appropriate to 
demonstrate our activities in these markets please let me know. I will be 
very grateful for such additional material and information . 

As always our timeline is tight and would therefore appreciate the data by 
close of business Friday.   
Let me know how this works
Thank you,

I thought some of you might like to see the following press quote, which was 
taken from a UK daily natural gas publication today. It nicely sums up 
EnronOnline:

"A new web based trading service drew significant levels of interest......One 
trader says he did "50 or 60 deals on EnronOnline.  "There's nothing 
fundamentally better about the form of trading", he says, "but they're always 
there, they're firm, and they don't go into a meeting for an hour."" -

I wanted to extend my thanks in advance to all of you who will join me in the 
office on January 1, 2000.  I appreciate your willingness to devote part of 
your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at Enron.  

As a company, Enron has spent much time and effort to ensure that business 
will continue smoothly as we move into the year 2000.  Ken Walther, in 
working with many of you, has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan 
for January 1.    Your  work on the first  will be the final step in this 
process.  Your efforts that day will allow all ENA employees to return to the 
office on January 4th with confidence in our ability to continue business as 
usual.  

I wish each one of you a happy new year.  I continually feel privileged to 
work with this dedicated and talented group of  employees.  I look forward to 
all that we will accomplish in 2000.   
Thanks for being so prompt.

Sally, as requested.. Sheila

Bennett Kaufman manages the Equity Trading and Credit Spread Trading Risk 
Management Groups.  He has been in this postion since February 1999.  He 
joined Enron in February 1998 as a Senior Specialist in Natural Gas 
Derivatives supporting the  Options Book..  Prior to coming to Houston, 
Bennett worked for investment banking firms in New York.  Bennett just 
completed his MBA in December.  




These dates look fine -- I hope that you have something fun planned!  The 
only slight glitch is that I will receive the bonus sheets on Monday, January 
10 and that our turn around time is one day.  If it is convenient for you we 
can talk by phone on Monday night to review bonuses for your group or we can 
plan on meeting first thing on Tuesday, the 11th.  I do not yet know at what 
time on Tuesday we will have to have final changes made.  --Sally

Subject: Various Discussion Points

I will commit to writing the three items that I had hoped to discuss with you 
today.  Feel free to get back with me via voice mail (x35926).  If you would 
prefer to discuss any of these with me, you can reach me at home from 
December 20-23 while I am on vacation.  My home number is 281-370-8568.  I 
will be back at work for the week between Christmas and New Years. 

1)  January 1:  Do you want me to call you that day after we have tested all 
systems to give you a status update?  I can leave a voice mail for you at 
your Enron number.  Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you 
will provide me with a number where you will be.  Cliff Baxter and several 
key commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed 
our testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we 
trade in North America.  I will make these phone calls myself, and will 
naturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential.  
Please let me know your preference for notification.  

2)  Definition of a global focus for trading operations:  Attached is a draft 
memo that Rick Causey proposes to send.  This memo describes a coordination 
role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that 
should be coordinated in all trading locations.  Please let me and/or Rick 
know if you have any comments or suggestions.  I had hoped to briefly discuss 
this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1) 
This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the 
needs of ENA.  I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control 
and service in ENA operations.  Through that hard work, I believe that I have 
your confidence in my ability to deliver results.  I  would do nothing to 
jeopardize that.  (2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and 
some one will play that role.  If I play that role, I can be in the best 
position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind.    



3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but 
I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants 
logistics to report to him.  His stated reason to me is that he wants it to 
"look like power".  I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what  
the criteria should be on which we make that decision.  I will propose to 
Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the 
regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable 
information about the pipes and capacity.  ( We have that now for the Central 
and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is 
built out for gas.)  I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report 
to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and 
West regions.  Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk, 
confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very 
closely with Jeff.   Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that 
the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of 
volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction 
in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.  Without a continuing focus in 
logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our 
ability to deliver our projected cost savings.  I also believe that Brent 
will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances.  
While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an 
earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that 
either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong 
front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding 
logistics accountable for their part in this.  

I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on 
this issue.   
We are wrapping up several hours in the office and have tested all 
commodities front to back.  We found a few minor issues, primarily reports 
with report dates that were incorrect.  The content and underlying 
calculations in the reports were correct.  These were really just query and 
formatting issues.  All were quick fixes of five minutes or less.  So at this 
point we feel confident about our system situation.  More will unfold with 
counterparties next week, but hopefully all found this as uneventful as have 
we.  

Hope your new year's celebration was fun.  We saw pictures of the London 
festivies on TV as we were cooking our New Year's eve dinner last night at 
home.  

See you soon.  I wanted to extend my thanks in advance to all of you who will join me in the 
office on January 1, 2000.  I appreciate your willingness to devote part of 
your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at Enron.  

As a company, Enron has spent much time and effort to ensure that business 
will continue smoothly as we move into the year 2000.  Ken Walther, in 
working with many of you, has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan 
for January 1.    Your  work on the first  will be the final step in this 
process.  Your efforts that day will allow all ENA employees to return to the 
office on January 4th with confidence in our ability to continue business as 
usual.  

I wish each one of you a happy new year.  I continually feel privileged to 
work with this dedicated and talented group of  employees.  I look forward to 
all that we will accomplish in 2000.   I know that over the past few weeks you have been handling your daily 
responsibilities and working on the transition of business from our 
aquisition of CES's wholesale business.  I realize that balancing all of this 
has been demanding, especially with the holidays, bid week and other end of 
year actitivies.  Thank you for the extra effort that you have given to 
effectively absorb the CES book of business.  It is noticed and appreciated.  

As we look forward to the new year, I thank you for your accomplishments and 
contributions in 1999.  It was a challenging and rewarding year for ENA and 
Energy Operations.  I hope that each one of you enjoys the New Year's 
celebration.  I look forward to all that will be accomplished by working 
together in 2000.   FYI -- As a result of a discussion that I had earlier in the week with 
Georgeanne...

Cindy:  My schedule was so hectic before going out on vacation on December 17 
that I am only now reading your message regarding a business owner sign-off 
for Unify/SAP integration.  I have asked Stephen Schwarz to give me his 
recommendation on the most appropriate person to do so.  I think that is a 
good idea.  As soon as schedules normalized following the holidays, I will be 
back to you with a name.  Whom would you recommend play this role for Energy Operations?  Let me know 
your thoughts.  --Sally

Subject: Need for Business Owner on SAP/Unify Interface

Sally,

Project Apollo has asked me to come up with a functional person from the 
business unit who will be responsible for sign off on the SAP/Unify 
interfaces.   My feeling is that there should be at least one person from the 
Settlements area and one person from Georgeanne Hodges' accounting group 
involved in the signoff.

To date we have been working very closely with Melissa White and Regan Smith 
from the technical side.  Additionally, there have been design workshops 
which have been attended by Lisa  Csikos and Evelyn Aucoin.  

Who would you like to be involved in this process??

If you could please let me know or let me know if you would like to sit down 
and talk about it.

Cindy
Did you get a copy of this?  It looks as if in September that our=20

Enron's reporting requirements which  we met about a couple of months ago.  
Below is a series of e-mail that talks about Enron's obligations as defined

Subject: Credit Policy with AEGIS



Jim, we are pleased to advise that AEGIS is putting the final touches on the
wording and we hope to have it to you shortly.  In working with them, we
made note of the obligations of both Enron and AEGIS as respects
documentation to support the contract.  In particular, AEGIS is obligated
pursuant to VIII. (c) to provide an accounting of the EAB from the date they
received the premium to the date six months after the policy incepted.
Thereafter, the accounting will be due every six months.  We have requested
this from AEGIS and will provide a statement to you when it is received.

Enron on the other hand is required to provide the following:

Page 4 of 13: IV. Definitions(i) Documents:

     Prior to each anniversary, INSURED
agrees to
     notify COMPANY of any material
change in the
     form of the agreements (ISDA,
Enfolio Master
     Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement, Master
Energy
     Purchase and Sale Agreement and
others which
     govern INSURED TRANSACTIONS).  The
     report shall consist of summary of
changes and
     red lined version of documents.

Page 7 of 13: VI. Conditions to Payment by the COMPANY(e)
     Evaluation of Creditworthiness by
INSURED:

     The INSURED hereby agrees to
promptly notify
     the COMPANY in writing of any
material changes
     in the process and procedures set
forth in the
     document titled XXXXXX (Credit
Procedures).

Page 7 of 13: VI. Conditions to Payment by the COMPANY (g)
     Report of Overdue Items:

     The INSURED shall remit a report to
the COMPANY
     no later than 45 days subsequent to
the end of each
     calendar month, a listing of all
past due amounts in
     excess of 60 days past due as of
that month-end
     date, which may be subject to
coverage hereunder.

Page 7 of 13: VII.  Settlement of Payments Due by the COMPANY
     or the INSURED (a):

     The INSURED shall provide to the
COMPANY within
     thirty (30) days after the end of
each half-year
     period a bordereau.....

Page 7 of 13: VII. Settlement of Payments Due by
     the COMPANY or the INSURED (c):

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
INSURED must
     notify the COMPANY in writing within
thirty (30)
     days after the INSURED first has
knowledge of
     any loss actually or potentially
subject to coverage
     under this policy....

There was some correspondence in October regarding the report of overdue
items (VI.(g)) and the bordereau (VII.(a)), both on page 7 of 13, however I
don't think that these reports have been generated.  We would appreciate
your assistance in obtaining these in order to provide them to AEGIS.
Additionally, we are obligated to provide underwriters with the revised
Credit Procedures and would appreciate an update on that process also.

Thank you for your assistance on these items.  Please let us know if you
have any questions or assist you in compiling these reports.

Hi Sally
Would you pls review, approve and forward the attached expense report to 
"Expense Report".   I will put the back-up in mail to A/P.

The flame on the msg is because this is the last day to get in 1999 expenses 
to Acctg!  
Thank you!

I will commit to writing the three items that I had hoped to discuss with you 
today.  Feel free to get back with me via voice mail (x35926).  If you would 
prefer to discuss any of these with me, you can reach me at home from 
December 20-23 while I am on vacation.  My home number is 281-370-8568.  I 
will be back at work for the week between Christmas and New Years. 

1)  January 1:  Do you want me to call you that day after we have tested all 
systems to give you a status update?  I can leave a voice mail for you at 
your Enron number.  Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you 
will provide me with a number where you will be.  Cliff Baxter and several 
key commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed 
our testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we 
trade in North America.  I will make these phone calls myself, and will 
naturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential.  
Please let me know your preference for notification.  

2)  Definition of a global focus for trading operations:  Attached is a draft 
memo that Rick Causey proposes to send.  This memo describes a coordination 
role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that 
should be coordinated in all trading locations.  Please let me and/or Rick 
know if you have any comments or suggestions.  I had hoped to briefly discuss 
this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1) 
This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the 
needs of ENA.  I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control 
and service in ENA operations.  Through that hard work, I believe that I have 
your confidence in my ability to deliver results.  I  would do nothing to 
jeopardize that.  (2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and 
some one will play that role.  If I play that role, I can be in the best 
position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind.    



3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but 
I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants 
logistics to report to him.  His stated reason to me is that he wants it to 
"look like power".  I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what  
the criteria should be on which we make that decision.  I will propose to 
Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the 
regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable 
information about the pipes and capacity.  ( We have that now for the Central 
and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is 
built out for gas.)  I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report 
to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and 
West regions.  Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk, 
confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very 
closely with Jeff.   Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that 
the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of 
volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction 
in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.  Without a continuing focus in 
logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our 
ability to deliver our projected cost savings.  I also believe that Brent 
will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances.  
While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an 
earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that 
either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong 
front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding 
logistics accountable for their part in this.  

I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on 
this issue.   Thanks for the note.  The family is doing well -- keeping us busy with a=20
teenager driver, one in junior high and Tyler who is almost three.  Hope th=
at=20

Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=

Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=

in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=

We are working very diligently to accommodate the need for space on the 30th 
floor.  Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to 
densify the floor during the next several months while Enron Property 
Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32.   In the mean 
time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the 
capacity on the floor.  While these locations are not prime spots, people 
will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow.  Once the window 
seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign 
groups on the floor and people will need to move once again.

I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while 
she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations 
personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors.  Susan Harrison is 
working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition 
period.  Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and 
equipment on the 30th floor.  If there are any problems once a move has 
occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment, 
printers, etc.), please contact Chantelle at Ext. 3-6279 as she will also 
coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items.  If Chantelle is not 
available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup.  Maria can be reached at Ext. 
3-5586.

I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the 
window spaces.  We can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes, paper and 
supplies on the floor.  Please coordinate with your assistant to have your 
area cleaned up by December 31.  During this clean-up process, if you have 
any documents that need to be filed and/or archived, please contact Carolyn 
Gilley in the Information and Records Management group at Ext. 3-5237 and she 
will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 30th floor.

Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a 
neat and professional work environment.  Between now and the summer of 2001 
when we will relocate to the new building, please keep in mind that we are 
all working in a temporary and makeshift environment.  I would greatly 
appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available 
space effectively.

If I have missed anyone on the distribution list that has just recently moved 
to the 3oth floor, please forward this message to them.
Approved.  Pls Process.  Thanks.  Sally Beck

FYI:

Effective today, the schedulers for HPL have relocated from the 42nd floor to 
the 30th floor.  This team reports to my direct report, Brenda Herod, who is 
the Business Controller for the Asset Group and Texas trading region.  They 
are on the west side of the building, just outside my office.  While room for 
this scheduling team was not available on the 31st floor, this move was made 
to improve communications with the Texas desk traders.  By being within the 
same elevator bank, we can now employ "squawk" boxes between the traders and 
this scheduling team.  As we look at space usage on the 32nd floor, this team 
should be included in space requirements.  We are working with Liz Taylor on 
those requirements.  I will attend the Houston Chapter GBN Winter Reception on Thursday, January 
6, 2000.  Thanks for the invitation.  Unfortunately, I will be on vacation next week 
and will not be able to attend.  Have fun!  --Sally

Thanks for the contact names.  You are right - no staff meeting on Monday, 
Deceber 20.  Have a merry Christmas!  --Sally Please give Gretel a final list of dates that you plan to be out of the

Sally,

I have not worked directly with Sheri Thomas until last week.  I work with 
members of her group and we have successfully managed to take care of 
trader's wishes for more flexibility related to logging in one time and 
having the trades mapped to the appropriate system depending on commodity 
traded.  The process is still taken care of through 'back-screen' programming 
and in my opinion should be easier to apply to all traders with 
cross-commodity portfolios.  The only one on one contact I have had with 
Sheri was to request that Power Risk be involved in the approval process when 
a trader was requesting an EOL login id.  There have been instances when 
traders will get set up on EOL but have not been set up in Enpower.  When 
this happens their transaction will not bridge because there is no place for 
them to go as Enpower has no way of recognizing them as a trader.  Sheri 
talked to one of her group members and had them include myself and my leads 
(for back-up) into the approval process of EOL trader setup.

She was understanding and responsive to my request.  I do not feel that I 
have had the appropriate exposure to her work to give her a formal rating, 
but I wanted to share the minimal experience I have had for your reviewal 
process.

Stacey
FYI - I need to talk with Shona tomorrow to get a read on what Rick wants 
here.  Do you have any ideas given your on-going conversations with David 
Port?  --Sally

Focusing the right people on the right issues is always a good idea.  I would 
like to visit with you to understand what you mean by "operational issues".  
My team has a meeting every other Monday focused on operational risk and we 
have various working groups that focus on key projects or initiatives that 
vary with need.  A daily meeting on operational issues would need to have the 
appropriate team members there, and I hesitate to add an additional meeting 
to any key folks on my team if operational projects/initiatives are being 
covered either in our Monday operational risk meeting or in another forum.

I have asked Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens to attend.  I 
don't have confirmation yet on whether or not all three will be able to 
attend.  I thought that if asked three, that this should work on one of their 
schedules.  I will let you know later who will attend.  I will be out of the

Three weeks ago I started a 15 minute meeting in my office on Monday mornings 
for a key group working on the commercialization effort of mid and back 
office services.  Attendees are my key operations personnel involved, Todd 
Busby (for a preview of what's to come), Rahil and Fred Philipson.  The 
purpose of the meeting is to review progress on items agreed to for the 
previous week and to establish priorities for the current week.  I have been 
capturing all of this on the white board in my office to date.  Today I 
decided to recap in writing for everyone.  Thought that you might be 
interested.  Open the attachment to the e-mail below.  This way you will know 
more of the details of our efforts each week.  --Sally

I will have that to you by the end of the afternoon.  I have set aside my 
afternoon to complete the timeline and resource needs, rewrite the 
presentation to originators, recap our Monday morning meeting on 
commercialization efforts for this week, work on my game plan for EES and get 
with Bob Hall to do an update for Brian Redmond on the HPL sale before his

So far, we have not done any further testing on ConfirmLogic since early last 
week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays.  
Kathryn called me late on Friday and said that they would let us know when we 
can resume testing.  We have not heard from them this morning.

Their demo last Thursday for the Beta Clients went well.  The customers that 
participated in the demo were Reliant, Dynegy, Calpine, and Sempra (Sempra 
participated via Video Conference from Enron's New York Office.)  Dynegy 
immediately said that they were very interested and I heard that Reliant 
called back and expressed their interest as well.

I will keep you posted on any further developments.

Kim Theriot 



I will be out of town on Thursday.  I think that it would be great if you 
could attend this info session on CommodityLogic - it would be good to hear 
how this project is being described to a wider audience within Enron.  If you 
can make it, please try to attend.  And I would love to have a voice mail 
message afterwards with your feedback from the info session.  Thanks.

As a follow up to our discussion earlier this week on commercialization of 
mid and back office services and managing those responsibilities for EWS, I 
will have a timeline for your review on Monday that will pinpoint key dates:  
Unify conversion, EES absorption, HPL sale, commercialization, Todd Busby's 
arrival, etc.  I will also have details of resource needs.  We can use this 
to set internal expectations on the timing of successfully handling all of 
these initiatives.  I will welcome your comments on the timeline.  --Sally You are right -- we are all in the same boat.  Or plane - or not on a plane.  
I have tried to get the Associates PRC meeting date switched with the Analyst 
PRC meeting (scheduled for December 12th).  This switch actually was arranged 
last week by working with Jana G. in the AA Program.  However, Charlene 
Jackson has apparently taken exception to that and is reportedly talking with 
Dave Delainey about this.  Keep me posted, and I will let you know if I hear 
anything new.  --Sally

It is my understanding that the names on this list are all attending the 
Associate PRC and attending the Las Vegas Offsite on the 13th... If year end 
PRC is anything like mid-year we can probably assume we will be out of their 
after 6:00 and we may have a tough time catching a flight into vegas that 
night.  I am checking on alternative travel plans and flight schedules for 
myself and will also keep you informed as to the what our options will be.  

If you don't need this info or there are any questions let me know, otherwise 
I will assume we are all in the same boat, and need to get to Vegas in the 
evening of the 13th..... either on commercial aircraft or co. jet.

Thought you'd like to know.  --Sally

Hadn't talked with you in a while and thought that I would send a quick note 
to say hello.  Saying it is busy here sounds a bit like a broken record, but 
it is busy here!  Big challege currently is juggling our huge day-to-day 
business for Enron Americas, starting the absorption of some pieces of EES 
(my part alone looks like an additional 120 employees, with the intent to 
find ways to assimilate that business and ultimately reduce overall support 
costs for Enron), the sale of Houston Pipeline to AEP that should conclude in 
June or July and the commercialization of mid and back office services.    
All of these of course with top priority!  

I am really enjoying having Beth Apollo on the team.  She has already made  a 
very positive impact, while she is learning the details of the operations 
side.  

How is life treating you?  I know that their is a lot going on in the London 
office, as well.  How has Ted Murphy's assimilation into the London office 
been?  Do you have plans to be in Houston any time soon?  

Keep me posted tomorrow on any news that you hear from Mike Jordan regarding 
their baby.  

Hope that all is well with you.  --Sally I will need a rental car in Oklahoma - looks like National is the one to 
use.  Thanks. --Sally

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.Thought you might be interested in these two changes.  Mary has actually been 
out of the office since late February.  All of her global database 
responsibilities were transferred in late 2000 to James Scribner and his 
team, under Beth Apollo.  Mary's effectiveness on CommodityLogic had been 
lessened over time, and beginning with her absence in February I have relied 
on my business leads (Bob Superty, Kim Theriot and Mechelle Stevens) for 
their evaluation of the NomLogic, ConfirmLogic and InvoiceLogic modules.

Subject: Management Team Changes

Mary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from Enron.  It is with 
regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.  Mary has 
contributed greatly during her tenure at Enron, particularly in the 
development of global information that has been critical in supporting our 
effective systems development and information gathering.  I do appreciate 
Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in 
wishing Mary well.  

Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within Enron Net Works of 
the group led by Sheri Thomas.  Sheri will now report directly to Andy 
Zipper, who leads EnronOnline.  The Operations Product Control Team in its 
early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a 
smooth one for operations.  Much time was spent initially on the bridges 
necessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems.  The role of the team 
has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day  
operations of EnronOnline.  With this evolution, it makes sense to have 
Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team.  Sheri's 
team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as 
Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the 
experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.  
Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this 
organizational realignment.  Sheri has done a great job of leading the 
Product Control Group over the past 14 months.  Sheri is committed to see 
that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any 
changes in Enron's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations 
are shared with us.  We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri 
and her team.   


Keep me posted on the impact of losing that day.  Thanks. --Sally

All,

Starting with the April accounting month Corp is cutting a day off of our 
close process as part of Project Sunrise.  This means that we will have only 
five days to get all activity booked.  I will be calling a meeting for later 
this week or early next week to discuss any issues that may arise from this 
and future implications of Project Sunrise.  Feel free to call if you have 
any questions.

Subject: Update on ConfirmLogic

I wanted to give you a quick update on ConfirmLogic....

Testing was done last week on the ConfirmLogic module.  On Thursday, we 
discussed with Kathryn Cordes and the ConfirmLogic IT team the items that we 
had found that were "show stoppers" as far as releasing the product for Beta 
Testing.  Some of the major Items found were the inability to properly handle 
Basis Swaps for Gas and inability to display meaningful Index References for 
Power (they were pulling in a code rather than a description of the Index).  

The team worked on the "fixes" and migrated the code last night.  Today 
during testing, they found that the new code had actually caused problems 
with the fixed price and volume information, which was working previously.  I 
talked to Kathryn and she said that the were rebuilding the code.  She said 
that someone had tested the fix last night and everything worked fine.  We 
plan more testing in the morning.

They are doing a high-level demo this Thursday for Beta Customers just to 
introduce the module.  They were planning on having more extensive Beta demos 
for each client starting next week but realize that those may have to 
postponed further.

We have told them that we would not sign off for Beta testing until we were 
comfortable that the items that we identified were working.  We need 
consistent, stable days of testing before I will feel comfortable.

Overall, we like the "new" streamlined version of the screens and feel that 
it will be a good product if they can work out the data display issues.

Call with any questions.

Sally,

I share your pain about increased deal flow.  Have you spoken with Lavo about 
getting additional resources or is there a way to better allocate resources?  
Is the Entelligence database used by anybody?  Should we not focus those 
resources on GCP?

I am getting hammered on the exposure questions.

Please help!!!

Subject: Re: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty  

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  "cleansing" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

still trying to eliminate some pages to make it more a more manageable size.  
I have taken the work that Rahil and Fred have done on the services and have 
made that into an appendix - nice work, but way too much detail for a

Subject: Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  
Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 
employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of 
the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule 
one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this 
segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees 
per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of 
operations employees):  

  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, 
settlements and EIM risk 

  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various 
products) 

  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., 
settlements and DPR           and MPR teams
  
  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), 
operational analysis

     
  37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global 
services       
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative "newcomer" to Enron 
Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would 
be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it 
easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally

I will serve as your representative in the year end 2000 Associates PRC 
Meeting.  ENA Management Committee  I represented some of you during the 
mid-year PRC meeting, and some of you are new to my list of Associates to 
represent.  

I have copied you on an e:mail message that I sent to your supervisor of 
record as of October 1, according to the records of the Analysts and 
Associates Program.  You will note that I have asked your supervisor to 
provide a list of your accomplishments for the second half of the year, as 
well as a description of your job responsibilities.  You may want to take 
charge of creating this information.  In addition to the input that I have 
requested from your supervisor, it would be helpful for me to have a copy of 
your resume (not necessary to repeat, if you gave me one at mid-year).  While 
the PRC process will focus on your accomplishments during the prescribed time 
period at Enron, it enhances my ability to represent you in the process if I 
have some background information on you.  

My assistant will contact you during the next few days to set up a time for 
me to meet with each one of you, if you would like to do so before the PRC 
meeting.  These meetings will be scheduled during the weeks of November 27 
and December 4.  I will also meet or talk with your supervisor during those 
two weeks in preparation for the PRC meeting.  

Feel free to call me if you have any questions about the process.  I will be 
out of the office the remainder of this week and most of next week, but I 
will check and respond to voice mail messages.  My number is x35926.   Back on the calendar this afternoon with Andy Zipper to get his comments on 
the presentation - should be able to get you and John a copy following that 
meeting.

I chose not to circulate a copy last Friday - reality was that I didn't think 
that any of the originators would read it over the weekend anyway.  We had 
hoped to have a final draft ready on Monday (April 9), with plans to review 
that with Andy Zipper for his input and then two "test runs" with Ed Baughman 
and Frank Vickers on Tuesday.  With any suggested changes from those test 
runs, my plan was to circulate copies to you and John Lavorato on Tuesday as 
well so that you would be aware of the approach with the origination teams.  
We scraped the idea of an offsite, and instead are setting up individual 
meetings with lead originators and their teams.  Unfortunately, I got food 
poisoning Monday night and was out of the office on Tuesday, so we are behind 
schedule by a day.  I am in the office today, but at about half speed, and we 
will try to make up for time lost yesterday.

Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, 
the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue 
sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the 
DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by 
this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are 
checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch 
both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all 
origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a 
date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do 
one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas   Frank Vickers (East)

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy 
and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL 
marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the 
opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with 
Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work 
for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you 
would like.  --Sally

In re-reading this, I noticed that Todd Hall was included in the distribution 
list.  He is the only one from Brent's team included.  Do you want to copy 
Brent as well, or was Todd's inclusion due to his previous responsibility 
over the MPR, which now is managed by Susie Ayala.  Either way, you may want 
to include Brent on the message just so that he and his team know about the 
creation of this common drive.  

What about Georgeanne Hodges?  Should she be notified as well?  You may also 
want to copy Wes as an FYI.  Thanks.

We have become increasingly concerned about confidential information

I chose not to circulate a copy last Friday - reality was that I didn't think 
that any of the originators would read it over the weekend anyway.  We had 
hoped to have a final draft ready on Monday (April 9), with plans to review 
that with Andy Zipper for his input and then two "test runs" with Ed Baughman 
and Frank Vickers on Tuesday.  With any suggested changes from those test 
runs, my plan was to circulate copies to you and John Lavorato on Tuesday as 
well so that you would be aware of the approach with the origination teams.  
We scraped the idea of an offsite, and instead are setting up individual 
meetings with lead originators and their teams.  Unfortunately, I got food 
poisoning Monday night and was out of the office on Tuesday, so we are behind 
schedule by a day.  I am in the office today, but at about half speed, and we

According to Tammy Shepperd who is very involved in space allocation for the 
new building, a location for Sheri Thomas' Product Control Group remains up 
in the air.  Sheri, Andy Zipper, John Cummings, and Surresh have met to 
discuss space, and all agree that Sheri's group needs to be located with 
their groups.  My understanding is that you have designated a certain number 
of spaces for ENW on the trading floors, but that Sheri's group is not 
included in that count.  Can we get together when you return to the office 
next week and discuss floor space?  Thanks.  --Sally Beth Apollo has recently joined the team and Brenda Herod has recently 
married.  February and March were gone before I could get organized enough to 
try to celebrate both of these occasions.  In honor of Beth's arrival and 
Brenda's marriage, I hope that you can join David and me for drinks and 
appetizers at our house on Saturday, May 5, followed by dinner at Champions 
Golf Club.  Please include your spouse or a guest, and know that we will also 
be happy to just have you attend.  Let me know if that date will work for 
you.  I would recommend floor meetings on 37 (we occupy almost the entire floor) 
and on the operations end of floor 32.  That would cover everyone pretty 
well.  Thanks. --Sally

Hi Sally -

Taking care of Philippe's emails while he's out.  Are there one or two floors 
that are occupied fully by your groups?  Please tell me the floors (probably 
two) where you would like the meetings and I will call Patti to coordinate 
your availability to attend.  I'll then send an email to your people 
notifying them of such.  

Thanks,

Subject: Suggestions for Floor Meeting Locations

The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  
Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 
employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of 
the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule 
one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this 
segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees 
per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of 
operations employees):  

  29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, 
settlements and EIM risk 

  30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various 
products) 

  31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., 
settlements and DPR           and MPR teams
  
  32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), 
operational analysis

     
  37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global 
services       
Also, given the fact that operations is a relative "newcomer" to Enron 
Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would 
be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it 
easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally

Patti will be distributing Astros tickets to you for the 2001 season.  We 
used a process that gives you tickets for games in proportion to the number 
of employees on your team.  I hope that you will enjoy the games and that you 
will also be able to use some of the tickets to reward employees for a job 
well done.  

We have improved our tickets this year.  Thanks to Patti, who scoped out 
options for new tickets, and to my husband, who studied advantages and 
disadvantages of each option, we  have some good seats for the year.  The new 
tickets (4 together) are Dugout tickets, located between home and third base, 
about 28 rows up from the field.  Not aisle tickets this year, but I sat in 
the seats for the pre-season opener, and they are a big improvement over last 
year!  We will work on the aisle for next  year.  We also still have the two 
Terrace level tickets as we did last year.  For some games you will get all 6 
tickets, and for others you may get either the Dugout Tickets or the Terrace 
tickets.  

Not a bad start to the season so far, so hopefully the new ballpark jinx is 
history!  --Sally ---------------------- Forwarded by Sally Beck/HOU/ECT on 04/09/2001 05:09 =

Patti:  I left Cindy a message last week about attending the NCL convention 
later in April.  She says that Ken and Jeff encourage board membership in 
community activities and that taking time during the business week is part of 
that.  So according to Cindy, the days at convention will not be counted as 
vacation days.  I guess I would view this as if I were in LA on business, so 
no notation on time out of the office.  Thanks.

Subject: Community Board Position

Your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of 
board positions held by VP's and above.  I thought that it might be helpful 
to have this in writing to add to your list.  Beginning with a fiscal year 
that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of 
National Charity League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization. 

We have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7 
through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.  We run bingo games in local 
nursing homes, provide "coaching" during practices for Special Olympics 
volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with 
children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.  It 
is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a 
focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only 
on themselves.  The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will 
remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.  
I will serve as a representative to the  Associates PRC meeting that will 
take place on December 12.  As a PRC rep, I have been assigned the Associates 
to represent in the meeting as indicated below.  The Associates Program has 
provided me with your name as the supervisor of record as of October 1 of the 
Associate as listed.  



Please send the following information to me by December 1.  

Associate's accomplishments for the second half of 2000 (prepared by the 
associate or summarized by you) 

Description of associate's current responsibilities/assignment (and any 
additional rotational assignments during this last six months of the year) 

Pre-ranking of the associate from your business unit PRC , or your suggestion 
on ranking if no business unit PRC process has been completed (Superior, 
Excellent, Strong, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or Issues) 

Any other information that you believe will be helpful in accurately 
representing the associate in the PRC process

Recommendation for promotion, if any 

I will receive a copy of the Consolidated Supervisor Feedback from the PEP 
system through the Associates Program.  

I will be at a management conference Thursday and Friday of this week, then 
on vacation until Monday, November 27.  My assistant, Patti Thompson, will be 
contacting you next week to arrange a time to meet or talk by phone during 
the week of November 27 or December 4 to discuss your associate and his/her 
performance in more detail.  I will also contact the Associates and meet with 
them individually in preparation for the PRC meeting.  

Thanks for your attention to this.  If you are not the appropriate PRC 
supervisor for the Associate listed above,  please reply by e:mail as soon as 
possible and my assistant will research where I should go next for this 
input.  Your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of 
board positions held by VP's and above.  I thought that it might be helpful 
to have this in writing to add to your list.  Beginning with a fiscal year 
that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of

remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.  I won't bury you with constant examples, but am copying you on this note 
regarding floor meetings.  While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works, 
I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our 
commercialization effort.  They are not in the habit of considering the 500 
people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.  Floor 
meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and 
yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with 
our reorganization late last fall.  I will diligently work with Philippe and 
Greg on this on an on-going basis.   While not fully embraced as part of Net 
Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key 
Enron businesses that we support.  I suspect that motivating and managing in 
this environment will become increasingly challenging.  This is an FYI more 
than anything else.  --Sally

I guess I shouldn't have responded before I read all of my e-mails.  I have a 
conference call with Sithe on Monday at 8:30.  The chances of if being done 
by 9:30 are about 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.

I'll make the next one.

Expect Patti to contact you about setting aside 15 minutes each Monday to 
meet in my office as a team to quickly prioritize tasks for the week 
regarding the commercialization of our services.  While we will certainly 
draw upon the knowledge of  others within Operations, we will consider this 
to be the core resource team.  We want to continue to build momentum for this 
effort.  Knowing that we are all stretched in managing the day-to-day 
business, this quick focus each week on the key tasks will keep all of us 
informed and in alignment.  Thanks!  






I have talked with Jeff Gossett, Leslie Reeves and Stacey White to let them 
know about the Saturday effort and the Sunday meeting.  They all will be in 
town this weekend and will be on call.    Their contact numbers are listed 
below:

(Kim Theriot reports to Leslie, so she will talk with Kim.  I don't have 
contact numbers for Kim.) I am hosting drinks at my home and dinner at Champions Golf Club on Saturday, 
May 5 for my operations team and their spouses.  Greg and I talked about this 
today.  He asked me to e-mail you so that you could put this on his calendar 
and said that you would e-mail his wife to check the date as well.  If he and 
his wife are available, I will let you know details as it gets closer.  
Thanks for your help.  --Sally Would you like to be included?  We will try to start this next week.  I will

business related e-mail messages require a prompt response from our business 
unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following

1)  Grant the necessary access to me to be able to review the incoming 
e-mails directed to Mary Solmonson since March 1, 2001 through today so that 
I can determine which ones require a business response that I can handle.   
Can these be transferred to my e:mail as a simplified way for me to complete 
this review?

2) Effective immediately, please create an automatic message for Mary's 
e-mail box that states "I am out of the office.  All e-mails are being 
forwarded to Vanessa Schulte for response."

3)  Effectively immediately, please route any new incoming e-mail messages to 
Vanessa Schulte's mail box. 

  Thanks in advance for your help on this matter.

This is a copy of the presentation that Bob Superty made to the Peoples 
Energy Board this week.  Lousie Kitchen told me that he was very impressive 
in the presentation (not a surprise to me, but it is nice when others 
recognize the talent that is in the operations organization).  We may be able 
to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal 
purposes, and there may be parts of this that could be used in external 
marketing tools. --Sally

Rahil will have a draft to me this afternoon, then he, Beth Apollo and I will 
meet tomorrow morning at 8:30 to discuss and revise.  I don't want to "mass 
mail" this on Friday.  (None of these guys will read it on Friday afternoon 
or over the weekend anyway.)  Instead, I want to meet with Frank Vickers and 
Ed Baughman (I have known both for years and we get both gas and power 
covered) either Friday afternoon or Monday to go over the presentation in 
person and get their thoughts and input (Rahil included).  They will likely 
come up with questions that we have not thought of or where our presentation 
could be tweaked.  With revisions from this session, then it makes sense to 
set up one on one meetings with each orgination team (we spread the word to 
the whole team, rather than just hitting the origination lead).  We can start 
those next week and finish most next week.  I think that the logistics of any 
offsite would be difficult with schedules and I don't really think that we 
need one.    

Calgary will need a special message, and we may have to go to Calgary to 
deliver it.  You and I can discuss that in more detail.   Max will be in from 
Mexico on April 20, and Beth Apollo has already booked some time with him on 
that day for us to cover this information.  Laura Luce is here today and will 
be back in Houston next Wednesday, April 11.  I have booked time with her 
that afternoon to cover the presentation.  That will leave Portland as the 
other "out of towner" to schedule.  I am planning a trip there the next time 
that Stacey White heads up there.  Right now we are looking at April 17, 18 
or 19.  We can send Chris info before that and plan to meet with him perhaps 
in conjunction with that trip that I need to make around our west power risk 
team.  I would  welcome your participation in any of the meetings here in 
Houston or on the trips that we will need to make.  You and I can discuss the 
appropriate make-up of the team for each of these presentations at lunch 
tomorrow.  

I think that this plan will be effective and will give us the best coverage 
and input.  Are you comfortable with this plan of attack?  --Sally

Why don't you and Rahil agree on the draft ASAP and then let Rahil send it 
out in draft form this Friday afternoon to all these individuals for their 
review and comments.  Rahil can work with these people directly next week on 
their comments.  Rahil is free from the day-to-day operations issues and has 
the time to push the product menu to the EA Originators.

We can still set up an offsite to finalize, but we need to get something out 
because these individuals are already out selling as we speak.

whoever they want can attend. 

I would actually prefer that the presentation is actually circulated to the 
groups on Friday rather than presented as we will wait forever on getting an 
offsite together.  How about circulating the presentation and then letting 
them refer all questions to Rahil - see how much interest you get.  One on 
ones are much better and I think this is how Rahil should proceed.  We need 
to get in front of customers in the next couple of weeks.

Let's aim to get a least three customers this quarter.

Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, 
the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue 
sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the 
DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by 
this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are 
checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch 
both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all 
origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a 
date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do 
one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas   Frank Vickers (East)
   Laura Luce (Central)
   Barry Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives  Fred LaGrasta

Power  Dave Duran
   Ozzie Pagan
   Ed Baughman
   

Portland  Chris Calger

Calgary  Ladain

Mexico  Max Y. 

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy 
and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL 
marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the 
opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with 
Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work 
for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you 
would like.  --Sally

Weren't we supposed to be having a meeting on costs of back office services

Andrew  Parsons is currently leading a project to define and quantify the 
costs for several different alternatives for disaster recovery.  We should 
get an update from him to see if there is anything applicable.   There is 
sheer disaster that impacts many companies/locations (which may require one 
approach), and then there is nusance stuff (frozen freeways in Houston, etc.) 
that really requires an updated contact list and set of notification 
procedures.  And then there is system failure and the requisite back up.

Subject: Re: Disaster Recovery / Business Resumption for Commodity Logic  

This topic came up at last week's technical meeting.  Several of the 
potential liabilities of EOL were discussed.  Given our ASP model, we have to 
offer a system even more robust than EOL.  In a related area, we began to 
discuss security, including some of the latest, inexpensive biometrics 
stuff.  Feel free to partcipate in this discussion. Tommy will be the lead on 
these topics.....

Subject: Disaster Recovery / Business Resumption for Commodity Logic

One of the calculated risks ENA has lived with is the potential 
unavailability of systems given a disaster strikes the Houston area such as a 
hurricane that knocks out power, etc.

Have you given any thought on the commodity logic side of providing a 
hot-backup / fail-over capability from another location ?  This could be 
particularly critical with the Contract Exchange module and might be one 
assurance customers would want before signing up.

For that matter, is there a market in providing disaster recovery / 
hot-backup capability to companies in high-risk areas?  It has traditionally 
been thought of as too expensive to warrant implementing such a capability 
for our own purposes.  Perhaps there are economies of scale that can be 
recognized when providing this capability for many.

I didn't read through all of the names, but wanted to make sure that we are 
including Beth Apollo on invites to participate in recruiting.  I think that 
I mentioned her to you.  She is a VP who joined my team in January after 
spending four years in Enron's London office.  She graduated from Trinity and 
worked in public accounting before coming to Enron.  She would be great to 
have on a team.  I would love for her to join us at UT, but if she has 
another preference that is great, too.  If she is not on your list yet, why 
don't you call her for an introduction and give her the rundown on the 
schools that you are responsible for so that she can make a choice.  Thanks.

I just want to give you an update on the Executive Report Viewer project in 
case you are not aware of the status. The development of the ERV project has 
been completed and delivered on schedule. The feedback from the demo was very 
positive. The application has been handed over for user acceptance test.

Great idea to run this by Louise.  She ususally has some good ideas on how 
things should look and feel online.  I would love to see it, too.  Thanks.

Sally,
It is on the list as a medium priority and we can discuss more on Monday.

I would not say that the system is totally done.  It is in User testing  -- 
Chris and crew are testing it and I will be getting a demo in the next week 
or two.  It has not been rolled out to the user community.  

I am also going to challenge them to think about whether there are any more 
quick "cosmetic" things that we could do with out much more time or cost.

Do you want to have a look before it rolls out?

Also  I thought maybe giving a preview to Louise would be good since she 
looks at the report pretty regularly, and is a big fan of automation.

Beth

business voice mail messages require a prompt response from our business 
unit.  Therefore, I am requesting your assistance in completing the following 
tasks:

1)  Please grant Vanessa Schulte access to Mary Solmonson's voice mail so 
that she change the access code for retrieving messages so that she can 
review any incoming voice mail messages and deliver appropriate business 
responses.  

2)  Please work with Vanessa Schulte on the process of forwarding all 
incoming calls on Mary Solmonson's line (713-853-6079) to Vanessa's line 
(x35565) if she so chooses.  She may prefer the ability to check voice mail 
messages on Mary's line to having Mary's line automatically forwarded to her 
line.  If she chooses not to forward Mary's line to hers, she will create a 
new message on Mary's line that can direct callers to Vanessa.

Sally,

I just want to give you an update on the Executive Report Viewer project in 
case you are not aware of the status. The development of the ERV project has 
been completed and delivered on schedule. The feedback from the demo was very 
positive. The application has been handed over for user acceptance test.

Thanks

Pecan pie would be great - I have tried but do not do that very well, but I 
love it.  I will probably make pumpkin chiffon and lemon/raspberry pie, so 
pecan would be a great addition.  Mom is going to do the rolls.  

We will put the reserved sign on the guest room for you  -  improvements in 
those quarters as well.  I recently cleaned out the guest room closet, bought 
new towels and have ordered new luggage racks.  We will use the old luggage 
racks in the media room.  Cool new blanket for the sofa bed in there, 
however, so Cara and Chris won't suffer too much.

Cool--although I did tell little C that since I was big C Richard and I were
taking the guest room!  I am such a lovely sister, yes?

Richard really, really loves pecan pie--I may try and make it and bring it
if that is ok with you....or I may just bring one from Luby's....

Really--a pound of coffee would make him very happy for his birthday...

See you soon--

Thanks for the suggestions for Richard.  Let me know if you think of other
ideas - I need b'day and Christmas ideas.

Probably the easiest thing to bring for Thanksgiving could be a dessert --
or something else that is a favorite of your family.  I know that it is
really kind of hard to travel with food -- particularly since you will
probably be working on Wednesday morning.  I have made Thanksgiving dinner
for so many years (one of the few times that I really like to cook), that I
will be glad to cover it.  Your company will be the very best thing that
you can bring.  We are looking forward to having you all here.  (The
sleeper sofa for the media room will arrive this Friday!)

Hi...

Still trying to think of things for Richard.  Electric can opener,
Guatemalan Antigua coffee, new shirt for racquetball--he says XXL--hard to
find but most chain sporting good stores have that size--probably white or
something very basic with a collar.  He really does need this--his
racquetball duds are looking pretty bad...

We are looking forward to Thanksgiving--can't believe it is next week!
What
can we bring?

Got your note.  It's a little premature to forecast now - we will have a 
better idea by April 15 - our timeline for completing our look at a revenue 
model.  Can we delay until then?  We do have a monthly fee of $16,000 that we 
are receiving from Bridgeline that, while small, you could include in our 
revenue line to date.  I am not sure why it is not showing up as income.  
Probably because we have been considered a cost center to date.  I suspect 
that the income is simply being recorded as an offset to one of our cost 
centers.  By copy of this memo to Brian Heinrich, could you and he figure out 
where that income is and classify it appropriately so that it shows as 
revenue?  Since our costs are fully allocated to business units, this should 
be pure margin.  Hey, you have to start somewhere!  

I have a lunch meeting scheduled with Greg Piper on Friday this week. One of 
the items that I want to discuss with him is how we want to treat expenses 
that we are incurring while researching the feasibility of this business.  I 
don't have an answer for you today on what if any costs will not be allocated 
to the business units.  Next week I can give you more info on that.

Sally,
One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the 
rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT 
for the remainder of 2001.  For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy 
since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so 
there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, 
however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for 
an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to 
be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to 
put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know 
in a few days I would appreciate it.

In summary the planned systems changes and manual substantiation efforts are

Subject: Merchanting Metals Update #2

The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( 
see attached email ) was to provide  
a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage, spread and brand 
and location
a timely substantiation of 
stock on balance sheet
forward MTM 
debtors and creditor balances
OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany 
account

Despite the best efforts of IT, continuing problems with the AS400 
application, a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock 
reconciliation reports, and concerns over the useability of the outright 
stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering 
sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - 
which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and 
forward positions to full accounting values.

Consequently I need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the 
following :

I will discuss with AA the following
that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to 
data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model 
simplifications)
that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses, 
AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these 
differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA 
within the audit timetable)
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my 
earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards 
) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to 
meet the above stated objectives
The signoff for additional permanent 'Enron' headcount who will 'duplicate' 
certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing 
Traffic staff
A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the 
final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400. We will continue to 
investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or 
system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe. However, 
this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and 
signoff of system p&l values with traders.
The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( 
reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and 
repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.

Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd - with full 
reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordination
an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing 
planned 23 rd review due to system issues ), requiring
full download of contract detail for later reference
reconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 th
sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to 
Barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually 
created position analysis
the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our 
cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtors/creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 
23 rd

I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval

Regards

Mike

Subject: Merchanting Metals update

Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating 
risk for the Merchanting Metals business.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility 
("OBSF") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility 
late in the year end audit.
The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, 
arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the 
operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result 
of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on 
gardening leave.
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting 
business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.

Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain 
comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as 
to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.

The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and 
effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage 
implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting 
developers.
The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as 
to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process 
tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all 
Metals businesses.
An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 
covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand 
and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within 
the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical 
VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been 
aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of 
Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements 
for the support of OBSF.
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control 
staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit 
timetable which incorporates 
A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source 
documentation within Enron
Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party 
inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will 
not be received on a timely basis
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward 
priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report 
signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( 
thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) 
and to AS400 Barclays account
A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where 
applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or 
external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts

I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during 
April 

If you have any questions please call me on x34703

Regards

Mike










It didn't occur to me until seeing Richard's message that we might have a 
hole in communications with Mary being out on an extended basis.  We should 
probably create a message on Mary's phone that refers callers to someone else 
- ditto on e:mail messages.  Beth, does it make sense for that referral to be 
James, or you, or Vanessa?  Others within our organization that may try to 
reach Mary could have questions about global databases, projects that Joel's 
group had been handling, etc.  I am not trying to put this off on you if you 
don't think it is appropriate - but James and/or Vanessa came to mind as 
possible contacts.  By copy to Hector, I also wonder if we should review 
incoming e:mails that have come to Mary over the last several weeks to see if 
there are some internal requests to which we need to respond.  Let me know 
what you think.  --Sally

Does Vanessa know anything about this?  I know that we had a definite 
interest several years ago in a system from Siebel.  We shelved it at the 
time due to IT resource constraints and Philippe's concern over costs.  In 
the meantime, EES bought a license and uses this system.  I know that Mary 
was resurrecting this with someone on her team.  She had recently reviewed it 
with Brenda Herod, I believe.  This is one of the items that we listed in 
Dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for 
others.  --Sally

Last summer we hosted a lunch for summer interns right at the end of their 
assignments with us.  We had other UT alums attend the lunch.  Feedback from 
the summer interns was favorable.  Their key comment, though, was that it 
would have been great to have had that get together earlier in the summer so 
that the interns could have networked with other Enron UT alums throughout 
the summer.  Can we plan something for the UT interns earlier this summer?  
It would probably work well to include the summer associates as well.  I will 
be glad to help in any way.  Just let me know.

Subject: Global Standard on Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval

Sally / Beth,

As we discussed when I was in Houston I have put together a draft on 
Valuation Methodology Changes and Model Approval. I had a meeting arranged 
for today to go through my proposal with Ted Murphy and Tani Nath (she heads 
up research and structuring here in London) but Ted cancelled at the last 
minute (again). Tani and I met and are broadly in agreement, but before we 
can go any further we need Ted's input. He is now away for 2 1/2 weeks so 
there is going to be no further progress on this front.

In the mean time I would appreciate your comments on what I have put 
together. I would prefer it if it is not circulated around Houston at this 
stage until I can accurately say that Ted is happy from a global RAC 
perspective. Likewise I still need to get Houston research comfortable but I 
am going to wait until Ted has had a chance to add his feedback so I can at 
least say that it is only Houston research that is outstanding. Others will 
also need to be consulted (and I would like to agree a list of key people 
with you) but I can't see their being any real contention. Can you ?

I am assuming that resourcing is likely to be an issue for you in Houston 
(and it may well be here too) and this has been added to the outstanding 
list. I am envisaging that some of the risk management work could be 
completed as part of the curve validation 

If there are any questions or feedback please let me know.

James




Can you print this for me?  Thanks.

Our vision to become The World's Leading Company positions our company for 
great success this year and beyond.  Our success is dependent on execution.  
With that in mind, we are making Enron's 2001 corporate and business unit 
goals available to employees.  

Please take a few minutes to review our 2001 goals on Enron's intranet at 
http://172.28.92.190/bowne/    We believe they will help you gain a better 
understanding of our vision for the company and will inspire you to identify 
innovative ways to help your organization and Enron achieve our objectives.  
We have a lot to accomplish this year, and with your hard work and 
dedication, we can realize another year of stellar performance.You are kind - and that's one of the things that I love about you!  I suppose 
that we should get serious about the dinner for Mom and Dad, since it is two 
months away.  I will be glad to handle invitations.  I will look for some 
this week and coordinate with Mom on final names and addresses.  Cara had 
sent an e:mail a few weeks ago with some detailed questions to answer.  I 
still have a copy of it, but haven't focused on it to date.  I will call you 
tonight and we can go through it and offer to Cara to follow up with 
Josephine's House if that would help her given her current charge at home.

John,

There has been a fair amount of discussion about this as well as the 
reporting of drift for the North America businesses.  Both Mike McConnell and 
Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.  I know 
that North America included US drift in its plan and includes "drift 
earnings" in its margin.  I believe you do the same in Europe.  Jeff is 
adamant that we not  move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has 
asked for UK drift to remain, as well.  You may want to call Jeff.  Sally and 
I will do what ever you guys decide.

Gary

I prepare the London Summary and I have been requested by John Sherriff here 
in London to have changes made to the reporting format of the Executive 
Viewer report.  John's request and the changes he has asked for are detailed 
below.  In essence, John would like Enron Europe's 'UK Drift' revenue to be 
reported under the 'Enron Europe' heading in the Exec Viewer instead of being 
reported under the 'Global Markets' heading.  If you agree to this change 
could you advise Chris Abel and Johnny Thibodeux to make the appropriate 
changes.  If, however,  you would like to discuss the matter further please 
contact John Sherriff.  

Regards

The attached is the format I believe we discussed and agreed with Ted a few 
days ago. In order that the guys in Houston will make the changes they 
require your authorisation.

If you can authorise by return then Michael Kass and I will forward it on to

Changes are required to the reporting format of Enron Europe's P/L in the 
Executive Viewer .  Below is a list of these changes as well as the person 
responsible for effecting each change:

Gary Hickerson: The UK Drift book is to be reclassified from the 'Enron 
Global Markets' heading to the 'Enron Europe' heading; 

Susie Ayala: The Enron Europe (Net Fair Value) Equity Investments book is to 
reclassified from 'Merchant Summary' to the 'Enron Europe' heading;

Chris Abel: The following changes are to be made to the books reported under 
the 'Enron Europe' heading:
 - J Block is to be reported as a separate line item;
 - Structured Derivatives UK is to include all other structured derivatives 
and power/gas accruals (currently reported under 'Other' line item); 
 - For each of the Electricty books, could you change the word Electricity to 
Power in the headings (for consistency purposes).
















Thanks for your note and resume.  I have sent a copy to our Managing Director 
of Global Financial Trading.  He is in our London office this week, with a 
pretty demanding schedule, so it may be early next week before I hear back 
from him with regard to his interest.  I look forward to talking with you

TO:  All EGM and EIM employees affected
FROM: Sally Beck, Managing Director of ENW-Global Risk Management Operations

Last fall, the Enron Wholesale Services organization was created and 
announced in an organizational memo from Jeff Skilling.  All wholesale 
companies (Enron Americas, Enron Europe, Enron Global Markets and Enron 
Industrial Markets) plus Enron Net Works and Enron Global Assets were 
included in the Enron Wholesale Services umbrella.  In that organizational 
memo, the Energy Operations team (now Global Risk Management Operations) was 
moved into Enron Net Works to align our operational services, information 
technology and e:commerce platforms in order to offer the best quality 
services to Enron wholesale customers.  This alignment also positions us to 
evaluate the prospect of packaging these services for other customers as 
well.  With this reorganization, we continue to maintain dedicated operations 
teams that support each of the wholesale businesses.

Since this reorganization occurred so close to year end, I suggested that we 
wait until January 1, 2001 to move employees under Enron Net Works.  Senior 
management, accounting and HR agreed with this date for effecting the move to 
Enron Networks.  Unfortunately, however, the January conversion to Networks 
did not get fully executed.  

To correct this, effective April 01, 2001, all EGM and EIM  employees  and 
non-employees who provide risk management operations services and ultimately 
report in to Brent Price and Brenda Herod, respectively, will be transferred 
to ENW - Global Risk Management Operations under  company 083E.   Starting 
April 1st, you should start using new cost centers for coding and timekeeping 
purposes.  This will formalize the ENW-Global Risk Management Operations' 
structure.

There are some direct effects that surround the conversion to Enron Net 
Works. Because you are transferring between Enron payroll companies, IRS 
requirements state that FICA withholding must start over.  This applies only 
to the OASDI (6.2%) which has a maximum wage base withholding of $80,400.00 
for 2001.  Medicare tax withholding of 1.45% has no cap and therefore does 
not start over but continues as usual.

The excess OASDI withholding that you incur for the year will credit to you 
on your 2001 tax return as withholding.  Therefore, to alleviate the burden 
of starting over, you can adjust your Federal income tax withholding down by 
filing a new Form W-4 and claim additional allowances which will reduce the 
withholding to adjust for the excess OASDI withholding.  Be sure to ask your 
tax advisor what additional steps you can take to balance out these changes.  
You may also contact the Payroll Department @ 713/345-5555 to assist you with 
any questions.  

We will continue to have dedicated HR reps who will work directly with you 
and your team and who will coordinate among themselves to share best 
practices that can positively impact all teams.  If you have questions, 
please call the HR representative who supports your organization, as 
identified below relative to the business unit to which your team is 
dedicated:

I am glad that the information that I sent was useful to you.  I had 
originally planned to be at Wellesley for the interviews on campus.  I now

free to call me if you have any questions either before or after the 
interview process.  --Sally

Subject: Telephone Outage Enron Houston

Sally, Bob - FYI 

I was able to get 5 telephone numbers set up on a temporary switch so if our 
counterparties call into the Enron building during the outage (Friday 10:00 
PM until Saturday 6 AM) they will get the voicemail of the 5 key schedulers 
that we selected. The voicemail gives the caller contact info. (page & home 
#'s). In addition if they hit zero it will be forwarded to our off-hours 
dispatching service. The dispatching service has current contact information 
for every pipe we do business on.  The schedulers were also instructed to 
call out to their key counterparties and make sure they have page, home and 
cell #'s.

If I had my way all of our schedulers telephone numbers would have been put 
on this temporary switch but five was the best we could do. Considering the 
time period I think we have minimal exposure however you never know when a 
pipeline of market emergency could occur. 

Let me know if you have any questions, tks - Bob

I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of 
what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.  
Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term "protocol" 
into these discussions.  To clarify, according to Anne, the "protocol" is not 
anticipated to be a formal legal document.  Instead, Anne envisions simply 
e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of 
information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.  
Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled 
exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron) 
to Steve Jackson (AEP).  

Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally 
documented.  Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the 
original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for 
gas to be delivered in the month of May.  He has worked with Enron's treasury 
group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband 
in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an 
Amendment to that agreement.   As of today, Legal has completed revisions to 
that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's 
Treasury group for her review.  Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the 
amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.  

We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition 
issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of 
you.  This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have 
to date captured the status of transition issues.  Items that only require 
actions by Enron will be our "to do" list.  Each item has a due date and we 
will update you weekly on progress.  Those items that fall under the AEP list 
or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we 
will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or 
memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.  I believe that this should satisfy your 
requests earlier this week for written "protocol".   We will also update you 
weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and 
AEP.  

I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update 
on the HPL sale.  To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest 
that we incorporate one of the following two approaches: 

 1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so 
that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and 
their status, or 

 2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a 
firsthand update to the two of you.  

Please let me know which one of these works best for you so that we can 
incorporate that into our schedules for next week.  
Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.  I can 
view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12 
attendees.  There were 30 or so, plus Greg Piper and Lisa Petruska.  I am 
missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?  If I am not 
missing a page, please ask Heather to include the complete list of attendees 
(all who were at the ASE plus Greg and Lisa).  A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees 
looks funny.  There were many more in attendance.  The cost of the meal makes 
more sense with a complete list of attendees.  Thanks.

Greg, the communication and interaction between the Logistics and NomLogic 
teams during the product development phase has gone extremely well. Both 
Carrie and I are committed to making sure this continues through the internal 
testing and beta release with the customers. I have a strong group of 
experienced Logistics schedulers working closely with the NomLogic team and 
expect that their involvement will help us identify as many issues as 
possible before the customers get to see the product. 

Please feel free to call if you have any additional questions or concerns,

All eight students that we interviewed for the Enron Scholarship were great 
and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules 
next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program.  I don't want 
to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.  Karen's 
letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting 
these students names on our radar screen for next year.  I will find out who 
the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes 
and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.  --Sally

Thanks for the suggestions for Richard.  Let me know if you think of other 
ideas - I need b'day and Christmas ideas.  

Probably the easiest thing to bring for Thanksgiving could be a dessert -- or 
something else that is a favorite of your family.  I know that it is really 
kind of hard to travel with food -- particularly since you will probably be 
working on Wednesday morning.  I have made Thanksgiving dinner for so many 
years (one of the few times that I really like to cook), that I will be glad 
to cover it.  Your company will be the very best thing that you can bring.  
We are looking forward to having you all here.  (The sleeper sofa for the 
media room will arrive this Friday!)

Hi...

Still trying to think of things for Richard.  Electric can opener,
Guatemalan Antigua coffee, new shirt for racquetball--he says XXL--hard to
find but most chain sporting good stores have that size--probably white or
something very basic with a collar.  He really does need this--his
racquetball duds are looking pretty bad...

We are looking forward to Thanksgiving--can't believe it is next week!  What
can we bring?

Are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester?  The 
dinner with Dean May and others from the University is great in the fall.  
But last year, we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and 
a few from Enron.  This can be simple and we don't have to coordinate around 
the schedule of any UT faculty or staff.  But it does allow Enron to have a 
more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their 
being chosen.  --Sally

Subject: Material for Commodity Logic meeting

Sally, I have attached a brief document with the material you requested for 
Thursday's Commodity Logic meeting. 

Let me know if you would like to hand this out or just have me discuss 
without handouts. 

Tks - Bob Superty



In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of 
people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that 
team.  From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that 
perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic 
has been limited.  The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team 
and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy 
Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through 
CommodityLogic.  I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the 
facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in 
conversations around CommodityLogic. 

Staffing Contributions
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (NomLogic):  Carrie Slagle, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Maanger (Integration):  Susan Harrison, Manager
 CommodityLogic Project Manager (ContactLogic)  Mary Solmonson, Senior 
Director
 CommodityLogic Team Member (NomLogic):  Molly Sumrow, Specialist

 User Requirement and Testing Staff:  Energy Operations Gas Schedulers, Power 
Confirmation Team and   Financial Settlements 

Projects Transferred to CommodityLogic

 NomLogic (previously known as Contract Exchange in Energy Operations)
 ContactLogic (global databases in Energy Operations) 


Two of the Project Managers on the team, Carrie Slagle and Susan Harrison, 
were transferred from Energy Operations to CommodityLogic.  Both had worked 
in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.  
Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles 
where they were charged with managing large teams of people.  But knowing 
both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the 
operations team who know a lot about the business.  Both have proven in the 
past to be good project leaders. Therefore, identifying them as project 
managers for CommodityLogic made a lot of sense -- providing gas operations 
experience to the CommodityLogic effort and utilizing their skills most 
appropriately .  Brent Price and I worked together to sell Susan and Carrie 
on the assignment and to transition them to their CommodityLogic roles very 
quickly.  

One of the key team members working under Carrie Slagle on NomLogic was a 
scheduler on our gas team (Molly).  Bob Hall, our opeartions controller over 
natural gas, suggested that a scheduler on the team would be valuable, since 
Carrie and Susan have actually never scheduled gas themselves.  NomLogic was 
already a project that was underway in Energy Operations.  We started the 
project shortly after the tremendous ramp up in natural gas volumes due to 
EOL transactions.  We called the project Contract Exchange, and Bob Superty, 
who is the daily manager over gas logistics, was the project sponsor.  Tom 
looped in our Contract Exchange project into CommodityLogic and subsequently 
renamed it NomLogic.  Molly had been a member of the Contract Exchange 
project team, and we transfered her along with the project to 
CommodityLogic.  

Many of my key employees in gas scheduling, confirmations and settlements 
work very closely with the various CommodityLogic project managers.  It is 
input from my group that has created the modules by defining user 
requirements and they have served as the testing teams as well.   

In the fall, I assigned Mary Solmonson to focus full time on CommodityLogic.  
I recognized that we needed more senior level involvement and I viewed Mary's 
participation as a good way to leverage my time.  Previously, she was a 
senior director managing our Global Databases group.  With an IT development 
background and a very thorough knowledge of our operations business, Mary was 
the perfect candidate out of my direct report team to focus on 
CommodityLogic.  Unfortunately, her recent health problems will curtail her 
involvement going forward.  During the five months that she was assigned to 
CommodityLogic, Mary developed a plan for ContactLogic that Tom feels is 
excellent and notes that it is an important complement to the other modules.  

Early in the project, I had also selected two very key and knowledgeable 
operations professionals to be part of the  CommodityLogic team - Leslie 
Reeves, who played a significant role in building Enron's power business from 
day one, and Todd Hall, with experience in natural gas and emerging 
products.  They were part of the  CommodityLogic team in the early days, and 
both made personal decisions to exit the team and return to managing mid and 
back office operations.   Susan Harrison and Carrie Slagle were their 
replacements on CommodityLogic.    
Thanks for your list.  I will add these to our Hot List.  Let me know about 
the A/R.  Thanks.  

Would love to hear about your trip in more detail.  --Sally

FYI

I will be out of the office on Wednesday, March 28.  I will be in Austin 
interviewing 1st year MBA students for the Enron Scholarships.  This will be 
the third year that Enron will give two to three $10,000 scholarships to top 
MBA students for use in their second year in business school.  It's great PR 
for Enron on campus (largest MBA scholarships given) and it has helped in our 
recruiting efforts as well.  We hired one of the first scholarship winners 
and he now works as an Associate in Generation Investments in Enron 
Americas.  Gene Humphrey was the senior member of the four-person interview 
team.  Now that is me.  This is just a day trip, and I will check messages 
during breaks and will be back in Houston late Wednesday afternoon.  

 I will also be in New York on Friday, March 30.  Steve Kean asked that I be 
the Enron participant at a Women in Business panel discussion at Columbia 
School of Business.   I think that the list of female MD's with their MBA is 
a short one.  Frank & Hector,

Here is the list of contractors that Kymberly sent Sally - please compare to 
list from Peggy McCurley that Sally gave you last week.

Sally asked me to set up several meetings for next week.   1st one - 
subject:  exactly what CommodityLogic is going to mean to us and how it will 
work for us.  She wants the two of you plus:  Leslie - can you designate your 
best person for ConfirmLogic & InvoiceLogic and Bob your best person for 
NomLogic.  Probably 1 &1/2 hours Monday.  Please let me know your 
availability.

2nd one:  Will probably be Thursday morning - can you check availability for 
this one also (2 hours).  Participants would be all of the above + Greg 
Piper, Tom Gros, Carrie Slagle, Project Managers for InvoiceLogic, 
ConfirmLogic, & BankLogic + Mark Taylor in Legal.  Purpose:  Discussion 
between Project Managers and end users on CommodityLogic.

I will wait to hear from you Monday morning re: 1st meeting.  I will talk to 
Greg's assistant re: his availability on Thursday and get back with you on 
2nd meeting.

Thanks,
Patti x39106I have tried but cannot get the attachment to open to look at the report 
produced by London.  Do you have a hard copy that I can see?  I can get it 
from you during the Risk Forum luncheon today.  Thanks.

Subject: Re: Rick Buy report

Sally - Plse see the attached summary that Risk Ops prepares for 
Frevert/Sherriff/Brown on Enron Europe every week.  Do your business unit 
controllers prepare something like this for the Americas, EGM, & EIM that we 
could use in our weekly briefing to Rick Buy?  What's happening is we try to 
prepare our own analysis of the trading P/L, and it really doesn't make much 
sense to do that since Ops is probably already doing it.  I'd love to get 
looped in to similar analyses for the other business units.  Also, do you 
know who I'd contact in  EES?  I'll call Barry Pearce for EBS.

Thank you,
Cassandra.

Subject: Re: Rick Buy report  


Attached is a copy of the latest European Trading Summary. 
As this report contains the same information as the Rick Buy report, I 
suggested to Ted that we stop duplicating work and simply use this report.



The report is usually produced on Monday mornings UK time, so should be ready 
when the Rick gets in the office.
People to contact wrt co-ordination are, Michael Kass or his superior James 
New.

Please let me know if this report will be used in this week's Rick Buy report.

Subject: Ops Weekly Update

Ted mentioned to me that you guys receive or participate or just know of some 
type of weekly Enron Europe update on Fridays for Sherriff??? or some top guy 
over there, and that Risk Operations (New/Jordan etc.) prepare a report for 
that update.  Meanwhile, back in Houston we (MRM) independently prepare a 
weekly update for Rick Buy on Thursdays.  I'd like to get a copy of the 
report done last week, and talk to whoever in MRM participates, if anyone 
does, or if it's just Ops then whoever that is.  I think Ted was thinking we 
could leverage off this report and maybe move Rick Buy's weekly update back a 
day to coincide.

Do you know what I'm talking about?  Or should I talk to Lloyd or Oliver? I'd 
like to discuss after the morning meeting tomorrow if you have a minute - 
maybe you can also fax or e-mail the report?  

Thanks,
Cassandra.

Subject: Doorstep Expenses

Per discussion with RAC management, during the budget approval process RAC's 
initial budget for Doorstep was eliminated.  Consequently, we cannot accept 
any charges from EAS for travel expenses.  

Ted Murphy indicated that Rick Causey stated at the inception of Doorstep 
that Doorstep costs should be charged to the business unit subject to the 
Doorstep visit.  

If you have any other questions, give me a call.

Regards,
Cassandra.
Did you get the changes that we discussed yesterday included before the 
response to the RFP went to CMS? 

Also, please send me a copy of the complete response to the RFP, assuming you 
have that.  You mentioned yesterday that the document we were reviewing was 
only part of the package.  I would like to see the whole thing.  

Thanks.  I didn't search this long list of addressees to see if you were included.  In 
case this is going only to Peggy, I thought that I would forward this since 
she is still on vacation.  --Sally

Subject: VMS Project Next Steps

All,

It has been a very successful year for the Enron / Razorfish VMS project 
Team.  We have been developing a Direct Access Power Market, user managed, 
tariff based calculation engine and customer expense / revenue allocation 
application.

The efforts which have taken place to date will benefit each of us as we move 
forward into these deregulated Direct Access markets.  The current 
application has gone through the following evolution:

Project Definition & Design documentation
Database Design / Development
User Interface Design / Development
Communication layer (COM) Design / Development
Hardware requisition / Implementation (Development / Test / Production)
Arthur Anderson Audit (Passed Audit review - Application meets all minimum 
requirements)
The Major Functionality / Action Items which have been delivered to date:
Security Management (Only IT Resources to have access)
Event / Task Management & Reporting
Component / Equations Management & Reporting
Estimation Generation Management & Reporting
Counter Party Profile Management & Reporting
Settlement Entity Profile Management & Reporting
Deal-Upload Management & Reporting
Integrated Dispute Management & Reporting
Customer Generation Charge Profile & Reporting
Historical Data Conversion mechanism
95 % of Calculation Engine Original Functional Requirements

The Major Functionality which is under it's final steps of Development and 
User Test
Reconciliation (Exception Identification, Allocation & Reporting)
Settlement Entity - Settlement Statement / Invoice Parsing & Reporting
Remaining 5% of Calculation Engine Functionality

Over the past 12+ months a total of $3 MM dollars has been spend on VMS.  We 
are reaching the final phase of this project and I am not sensing that 
everyone is still on board with this being OUR (Enron) Volume Management 
strategic solutions for Direct Access Power Markets.

As of March 1, 2001 we no longer have a contract in place with Razorfish.  
Razorfish has provided six developers dedicated to assist the Enron Networks 
IT staff in delivering the VMS solution over the past year.  These resources 
have been key in helping us get to where we are today.  In addition we had 
originally planned to retain these resources over the remainder of 2001 
(03/2001 - 12/2001) to assist with the implementation of VMS on the West & 
East Desk and in the Toronto Canada office.  Without a contract in place and 
currently working on good faith.  The project has come to a serious point of 
action.  Razorfish is asking for a total of $728,000 for services rendered 
between 3/1/2001 and 6/30/2001.  They will keep the resources dedicated to 
the project and will deliver the following:
Finalise base product development, assist in unit / user testing and 
Implement base VMS Product in Production.
Application Production Support for 30 Days post Implementation
Transition of knowledge base from Razorfish resources to Enron Networks IT 
resources

Razorfish is willing to discuss terms to assist Enron throughout the 
remainder of the year.  However,  I don't feel that everyone is ready to make 
that decision.  We do however need to make a final decision on this first 
implementation.

As I have stated prior in this document,  "We have accomplished a lot over 
the past year."  Without the continued assistance from the Razorfish portion 
of the VMS team.  I don't see any of us meeting our 2001 Volume Management 
(VM) Direct Access Power Market objectives in a more efficient or economical 
fashion.  In some cases I don't see it being possible at all.

It is time to make a decision.  Do we all agree that we need to move forward 
and retain Razorfish services for the additional $728,000 and incur each of 
OUR allocation of the over all VMS capitalised project total cost or do we 
stop where we are and find other solution to address our needs and debate 
over who was in agreement in the beginning of the project in order to 
determine who picks up the $3 MM already spent.

Please provide me with your response by 5:00 PM PT to allow me to get back to 
Razorfish with a well deserved response by Friday.

Thanks - MO

FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week.  No 
problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access 
issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their 
jobs.  She has quickly identified a point person within Operations in Houston 
who is bi-lingual (Gordon).  Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's 
responsiveness and the doorstep process in general.  Just wanted to pass this 
along.  --Sally

I got the message that you couldn't meet this afternoon.  Thought I would do 
a quick note to bring you up to date on some things. 

Commercialization Efforts- Services:  Delayed by several days due to the 
unexpected absence of Mary Solmonson for health reasons.  I learned about 
this when I returned to the office on Tuesday, and have worked to replace her 
as best we can during this market sizing phase.  Jennifer Denney (who was in 
Dallas with us and works under Sheri Thomas in the EOL Product Control Group) 
will partner with James Scribner in Mary's absence to help us run down 
additional data on potential customers.  Beth Apollo will be working closely

work with Jennifer on developing the revenue model.  

Commercialization Efforts - Consulting:  Bjorn Hagelman in the RAC group made 
a presentation at the Risk Forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for 
providing risk consulting services to external customers.  Some of his ideas 
overlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our Dallas 
meeting.  Some of his ideas included providing services from my risk 
operations team.  I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort.  
Bjorn's vision is to create an Enron sub that will be the consulting 
company.  Our team in Dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an 
accounting/consulting firm - established marketing arm, existing customer 
contacts, proven consulting skills, depth of resources, etc.  There could be 
a play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us 
- we impart our risk knowledge, they get the edge in the marketplace from 
pairing with us, we take our upfront payment, they do most of the grinding 
work - not necessarily a bad model.  Bjorn seems to be in a hurry, as he has 
identified a shipping company in Europe that is in need of risk consulting 
and is ready to pay.  Probably okay for him to start this effort in that 
way.  Prove concept, and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with 
someone else.  I spent some time with him today.  I want to be sure that he 
doesn't commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and 
being in agreement with the fee structure.  We are okay for right now.  I 
will be following what Bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together 
if there is a good upside.  I will keep you posted.  

Commercialization Efforts - Internal Marketing:  We have to change some 
business practices within Enron and create a mind shift when originators are 
selling operational services to their customers.  We must price those and we 
must have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to Operations.  
Deal is in the works through power origination team - they priced our 
services to customer without our involvement- pricing may not even be 
sufficient to cover our costs.  We are researching.  To do's here are to 
create an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to 
change DASH process so that Operations has a sign-off.  I met with Louise 
today on this.  I will plan meetings with origination teams during the week 
of March 19.  Would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig 
teams.  I will get you a draft for your comments. 

Operational Risk:  Key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in 
Portland.  Have worked with Stacey White (my power risk director) and Tim 
Belden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work.  
I am comfortable that we have devised a good plan.  (We lost the manager of 
that group last week - a planned move to London to follow her husband to an 
Enron job there.  Our unexpected change this week was the resignation Monday 
of another risk book administrator from Portland.) 

Operational Risk:  Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale.  
End of day today we will know which employees are going to AEP.  We are 
working on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues 
with customers after the sale effective date.  We expect to eliminate 46 
positions with the sale.  This number was much larger earlier in the year 
(around 70), but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale.  Bob 
Hall is focused on the details around this issue.  

Operational Risk:  We completed a Doorstep Review on the Monterrey office 
last week.  (This is the review of operational controls and procedures.)  
Went well - Max was skeptical about the process at first, but pleased in the 
end.  I will forward and e:mail to you from Max proclaiming his support of 
these reviews.  We overhauled this week the Doorstep Review schedule for the 
remainder of the year and reviewed that today with Rick Causey.  He likes the 
revisions that we have made.  Beth Apollo on my team is leading this effort.  

Spring Break Plans:  My children are on Spring Break the week of March 12 and 
the nanny has the week off.  We will be out of town through Wednesday, March 
13 with the whole family looking at colleges for Meagan.  Patti has contact 
numbers for me if needed.  I may decide to come back into the office on 
Thursday and Friday.  I will let Patti know when we get back in town.  I will 
either see you the end of next week, or back on Monday, March 19.  See 
separate e:mail for contact names and numbers in Operations while I am out.  

 




Meant to copy you on this note.  I will either see you on Thursday next week, 
or on Monday the 19th.  --Sally

Sally,

I share your pain about increased deal flow.  Have you spoken with Lavo about 
getting additional resources or is there a way to better allocate resources?  
Is the Entelligence database used by anybody?  Should we not focus those

I am getting hammered on the exposure questions.

Subject: Re: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty  

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  "cleansing" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

Mike and Sally:

As you know, I attended the AAPL scholarship interviews conducted Tuesday, 
March 6 at OU.  Of the 23 students which interviewed, 3 are current or former 
Enron interns (Clay Shamblin, Michelle Terry, and Nadege Assale).

I have designated $1500 from my budget to be awarded at the EM Spring Awards 
Banquet which will be held April 20 on campus.  

I met with Jody Crook yesterday, and it is our recommendation to award $500 
to Clay, Michelle, and Nadege.  I think this will help impress upon the 
students how Enron values its interns.

The remaining candidates which interviewed ranged from Freshmen to Seniors, 
and I do not feel that awarding them money at this point would necessarily 
improve our success on campus.

I look forward to your feedback.

John,

There has been a fair amount of discussion about this as well as the 
reporting of drift for the North America businesses.  Both Mike McConnell and 
Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.  I know 
that North America included US drift in its plan and includes "drift 
earnings" in its margin.  I believe you do the same in Europe.  Jeff is 
adamant that we not  move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has 
asked for UK drift to remain, as well.  You may want to call Jeff.  Sally and 
I will do what ever you guys decide.

responsible for effecting each change:

Gary Hickerson: The UK Drift book is to be reclassified from the 'Enron 
Global Markets' heading to the 'Enron Europe' heading; 

Susie Ayala: The Enron Europe (Net Fair Value) Equity Investments book is to 
reclassified from 'Merchant Summary' to the 'Enron Europe' heading;

Chris Abel: The following changes are to be made to the books reported under 
the 'Enron Europe' heading:
 - J Block is to be reported as a separate line item;
 - Structured Derivatives UK is to include all other structured derivatives 
and power/gas accruals (currently reported under 'Other' line item); 
 - For each of the Electricty books, could you change the word Electricity to 
Power in the headings (for consistency purposes).

Max - Hi there, sounded like (from Jaime) you guys have had a busy week with 
various government officials.  I hope the result was good.

We all had a really helpful meeting here in Houston with those guys, and I 
just wanted to let you know that we have found a person to focus time on 
Mexico and work with Jaime and Agustin.  He is bi-lingual and very excited 
about the prospect.  We expect him to be proactive and help out quite a bit 
with setting up the new Mexico trading legal entity.   I have no doubt that 
this will fix most of the little issues that we discussed.  

We also assigned someone to come to Monterrey to set up Jaime and Agustin 
with system access where appropriate, and especially access to Livelink, our 
automated contract viewing system.  This should facilitate access to all 
Mexico contracts online (originals kept in Houston), and there should be no 
need to keep hard copies in Mexico.

Please let me know if you see any other areas where Energy Ops can help, or 
should be more involved.

I took the Executive Influence and Impact program in May 1999 and also took 
the follow up Communications program in 2000.  Is this another program that 
you are contacting me about, or would Enron like for us to repeat the 
program?  Hopefully HR records indicate that I completed the two programs in 
1999 and 2000.  Just let me know if I need to sign up for anything.  --Sally

Thanks for sending me your thoughts from the meeting you attended.  These are 
interesting, and definitely can relate to some of the things that we 
discussed in Dallas.  Please continue to send me any thoughts you have on the 
subject.  I will organize a recap of the recent work we have done in trying 
to "size" the market for our services and get that out to all attendees 
within the next week or so.  --Sally

Subject: FYI: STP and T+1

Sally,
I went to a seminar on Monday evening organised by a consultancy called The 
Capital Markets Company, who did the market analysis on the T+1 idea for the 
Global STP association.
Attendees were UBS Warburg, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Depository Trust 
Company etc
The subject was nominally how moving to T+1 settlement in the financial 
markets would affect STP, but it ended up going rather wider than that.
There were distinct echoes of some of the discussions at the ASE in Dallas, 
so I thought you might be interested to see some of the thoughts expressed:

It seemed that every bank was hoping to be able to sell the back-office 
services, but no-one seemed to be willing to buy!
Some people would only ever buy if there was more than one supplier, so that 
there was a competitive market.
Somebody will eventually break through to be able to offer the services.
One cannot avoid having to understand processes by outsourcing - one needs to 
understand the process in order to police the SLA.
Support personnel perceive that it will probably be 5 years before it becomes 
so difficult to make more more in the front office that there will be serious 
focus on saving money in the back office.
Nobody's compensation is realistically tied to achieving operational metrics.
Nothing will change until there is a crisis.
T+1 would just increase the number of fails. (this might be the crisis which 
would drive out the weaker players which would mean that the remaining 
players would be only dealing with better--organised counterparties which 
would decrease the number of fails)
This last point prompts the thought that the quickest way to generate lots of 
demand for EEO services from outside would be to have the standard cycle 
times reduced (have FERC insist?). But we would have to make sure we could 
cope to!

Still checking kids schedules at home for the 19th.  I will let you know 
tomorrow.  --Sally

Hello Team!!!

The rescheduled Wellesley interview dates are confirmed for March 13th and 
14th.  The tentative dates did not work because it was Spring Break for the 
students.  The Pre-Interview Reception will take place the 12th.  I am in 
need of interviewers still.  I am scheduling the same greeters to return.  
The participants so far are the following:

Pre-Interview Reception First Round  Second Round
Geynille Dillingham  Vacant (I)  Jean Mrha

Please call me or e-mail as soon as possible if you can attend.  As you can 
see I need three interviewers.  

Thanks, Geynille

Please get with Tina and work out how we will handle expense reimbursements 
for Greg's approval.  If Tina and Greg are not yet using the online format, 
then simply sending him original receipts probably won't do anything for

Thanks for your message.  I thought that John did have responsibility for 
risk, and I am glad to have that clarified.   Kristin worked for me for 
several years as the risk lead for ENA power and joined Barry at EBS last 
August, so I knew that you all had a great resource there!  

I will look forward to a follow-up conversation to explore where we may have 
potential solutions for EBS that can be borrowed or modified from EWS.  Just 
give me a call when you are ready to get back together.  --Sally

I do want to correct one misstatement that I made.  John DOES have ownership

Thanks for your comments on the standards.  Our approach in creating a global 
exception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there.  Our 
initial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical 
standards by the end of this year.  That will be a first, to on a daily basis 
have a view into the exceptions outside the global  standards.  Many of the 
measurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the 
level of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence 
of those that are managing these services.  Some of these may be more 
appropriately contained in a monthly operations report that I have instituted 
within ENA and which we are working to proliferate across all of the 
wholesale merchant services companies.  Give me a call and we can set a time 
to get together for a few minutes and I can review this operating report with 
you.  

We spent some time at our offsite in late October with all operations 
controllers reviewing and discussing these standards.  Shona has taken a stab 
at the format of these exception reports.  It is likely that we will have a 
rep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of 
these reports, so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these 
reports.  

Yes, we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for 
these activities.  My purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute, 
but instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as 
needed to clear the exceptions.  It is invariably the deals that are 
exceptions in some way that create the problems.  For instance, small power 
deals that were done in Calgary before they had a power book set up.  These 
were "on the side" and not captured in total power exposure because they 
didn't have a book to put them in (a discovery during the doorstep review).  
If this goes on the exception report, then we can highjack someone in risk in 
Houston to help Calgary set up a new book, or get IT resources focused 
quickly on any solution that may require their input to fix.  By having a 
prescribed elevation of these exceptions, we should get the appropriate 
attention to correct them.  The spur for making sure that all exceptions are 
appropriately noted, will be that if there is a problem with any deal that 
was an exception (not in the books, no confirm, etc.) and was not included on 
the exception report, that this will be grounds for termination for the 
appropriate operations controller.  I will make sure that as we start this 
reporting process that this is well understood.  The other impetus will be 
that during doorstep reviews the operational activities will be gauged 
against these standards.  The AA internal audits should also access adherence 
to these.

This is the first time I have seen these - have they been rolled out ?

I would be interested to see the format of the exception reporting that 
attaches to these standards that you mentioned - did you have anything 
particular in mind ?

I had a few of my own ideas for some diagnostic measures of the extent to 
which these standards are being adhered to - see what you think:

Transactions are recorded accurately and timely (completeness, accuracy)

Daily report of "holdovers" by commodity group (trades not booked in time for 
daily cut - off, including counterparty, volume, price etc)
Report of P&L effect of booking errors as they transpire, including 
responsibility

Daily Management P&L and Position reporting is accurate and timely 
(completeness, accuracy)

Periodic qualitative review by RAC (i.e. Is it sufficient by reference to the 
Risk Management Policy - does it show delta gamma vega as a term structure 
etc....)

NB: the point about "Reports issued on next day of trading at a commercially 
pre-determined time" conflicts with the Risk Managemet Policy, which says 
"...before any subsequent trading ocurrs". I think the diagnostic measure 
should be, for each commodity DPR a report daily of all those signed off as 
final (note I do not neccessarily mean "officialized") after the relevant 
market opening time (usuaully 7.30 am)

Timely confirmation and execution of transactions (completeness, accuracy, 
existence)

Monthly report of all unmatched confirmations:

- outstanding inward confirmations (i.e. sent out, not signed) 
- outstanding outward confirmations (i.e deal done, confirm not sent) 
- outstanding mismatched or disputed confirmations

showing deal trade date, start date, commodity, counterparty, MTM value, aged

Settlements with counterparties occurs accurately and timely (non CACS, non 
Dashed deals)

Monthly report of cumulative amounts of all unmatched or unapplied cash:

Unapplied cash by counterparty, in original denomination, including deal 
reference if any
Unmatched amounts by deal, where settled amount differs from maturing forward 
MTM value

One additional thing that ocurred to me was the fact that those responsible 
for supplying the information are also those responsible for the operation 
underlying it in some sense, so the obvious pitfalls of self - assessment 
will come into play here. Perhaps the "pilot" report should be put together 
somehow independently.

Views ?

Count me in - I have really enjoyed doing this during the past two years.   I 
will review the 16 applications and will rank order the top eight for you by 
the end of this week.  For your planning purposes, I will be available to 
interview at UT during the week of March 26.  Best days for me are Tuesday, 
March 27 and Thursday, March 29.  I can make other days work as well.  For 
the luncheon during the week of April 16, I am available on April 16, 17, 18 
or 19th.  Hope this helps.  

If you do not have enough response from your list below, let me know and I 
will help put together a team to interview potential scholarship recepients 
on campus.  --Sally

From: Karen Marshall, University Affairs
 

I want to thank each of you for your past participation in the selection 
process of the recipients of the UT Enron MBA Excellence Scholarships.  As 
you know, the Enron Endowed scholarships are part of a $3 million gift to the 
school  with $1 million earmarked to endow the Enron UT MBA excellence fund.  
Our scholarships are among the largest at the McCombs School of Business and 
it is important to seek the highest level of involvement for the selection of 
this prestigious award.  Because of your knowledge of the company, your  
judgement and your leadership ability, I am soliciting your help again in 
selecting the recipients of the 2001 scholarships.  

The school has submitted sixteen outstanding candidates for Enron's 
consideration and are confident that we are reviewing the very best out of 
over 100 first year MBA students who actually applied for our scholarships.  
It is now up to us to determine who the final 3 recipients of the $10,000 
scholarships will be.  We are seeking the best and brightest students who 
exemplify the vision, values and beliefs of Enron, regardless of commitment 
to a career in energy.   

In order to expedite the process, I am sending you  the package  with the 16 
applicants for your review.  I would like to get your feedback in rank order 
of the top 8 candidates no later than March 16th.  After we have narrowed the 
pool down  to the top 8 candidates, I will contact the students and arrange 
for a face to face interview in Austin with the Enron team members that are 
able to travel to UT  to make the final selection of the winners.

The school has a very tight deadline that we must comply with for the 
selection of candidates.   Below is a timeline of the process: 

March   6, 2001  - Send applications to Enron Team for review
March 16, 2001 -  Reply to Karen Marshall with the ranking of the top 8 
candidates based on the application
March 19,  2001 - Schedule interviews on campus with Enron team and 
scholarship applicants
March 26, 2001 -   Week of March 26 students are interviewed and winners 
selected
March 29, 2001 -   Announcement of Scholarship  Winners 
April 16, 2001    -  Week of April 16th, schedule a small intimate luncheon 
with Enron executive and the scholarship winners
Sept 10, 2001-      Week of Sept 10th, schedule Scholarship Award Dinner for 
winners and their family, the faculty, the Dean and the Enron team 

If your schedule does not allow you to participate in the selection process 
this year, please let me know immediately so that we don't miss the 
deadlines.

Just a word of thanks for setting up the interviews last week.  I was 
thoroughly impressed with the groups and saw several areas which I would like 
to explore further.  I will be following up with Beth Apollo, Brenda Herod

We got back from Dallas yesterday about 5:00 and it was a fun and very 
fruitful trip for the team.  
Schools are categorized by size - small, medium, large and super.  Klein is 
super-sized.  The Bearkadettes won first place and the grand champion trophy 
in the super category.  Best in Category awards are given for each category 
of team dance entered, regardless of school size.  Klein won best in category 
for all four team dances entered - kick, pom, military and jazz - a clean 
sweep.  Klein also had the first place winner in the solo category and first 
place in the duet category.  Also won first place in officer dances for super 
sized schools.  They also won two special judges awards - not given out every 
time, but only when the judges want to especially recognize achievements.  
They got a special judges award for Creativity and Originality (commentary on 
both our fabulous costumes made by a group of Bearkadette moms and the 
choreography) and a special judges award for Perfect Score (a score of 100 
awarded by all 3 judges for a particular routine - apparently very rare).  
The Perfect Score award was for their pom routine, where they are dressed 
like penguins (one of the ones that Meagan was in).  The girls were pretty 
excited and the moms were cheering a lot, too.  They all work so hard and 
spend so many hours practicing that it is nice to see that pay off!!

I am ordering the video from competition, so we can show you the routines 
sometime.  

I had a lot of fun.  The girls are cute and I enjoyed getting to know some of 
the moms who were chaperoning as well.  But it was nice to get back to 
Houston yesterday.  Thanks for the update.  Good to know that the current due date still looks 
likely - always give or take a week or so!  I have just returned from drill 
team contest in Dallas - lots of fun and the Bearkadettes did great!  First 
place in their division (super sized schools), best in category for all four 
team dances, first place solo, first place duet, first place officers dance, 
and two special judges awards - one for a perfect score of 100 from all three 
judges on one team routine (which Meagan was in) and one for creativity and 
presentation.  

Keep me posted on baby news!! --Sally

An update on two of the items that we discussed before you went out of town:

Due Diligence Teams for Acquisitions Identified

I have worked with my operations controllers in EWS and have identified a 
short list of individuals that we could use in the due diligence efforts on 
potential acquisitions.  We have identified our target teams for due 
diligence efforts around commodities.  While each person on the list has 
other duties currently, all have back ups that would allow them to be devoted 
to projects as they arise.  I will review this list continually and update it 
as I identify other qualified operations personnel who could do an excellent 
job as part of a due diligence team.  I mentioned that Kristin Albrecht had 
created a due diligence check list while she was in London on the MG 
acquisition.  We will hold a session in the next 10 days to review this 
checklist so that all are prepared.  Let me know if you are interested in the 
names on my list.  Also let me know if there is a pending due diligence 
effort.  

Dedicated Support Named for Transportation Business

I met with Dan Reck and Chris Kravas week before last and have reviewed the 
executive summary from the consulting team.  I followed up with Brent Price 
(my operations controller for EGM) to review his plan for creating an 
appropriate infrastructure to support that business.  Currently, Todd Hall 
and Mike Perun on Brent's team are assessing what needs to be done.  Todd has 
other responsibilities and Dan Reck was concerned about the amount of time 
that Todd would have.  Brent has since recruited Shelley Stubbs to play the 
lead role over operations integration for Webmodal.  She will be returning to 
Houston from the London office by the end of March.  She will be able to 
split her time starting next week to focus on Webmodal.  Todd will stay 
involved until Shelley is devoted fulltime at the end of March.  We will also 
keep Mike Perun on the assignment working for Shelley.  Shelley is expected 
to be in Houston next week, and I will sit in on meetings with her next week 
regarding our plans.  I will keep you posted. You have the right Sally Beck.  I grew up around the corner from your dad and 
used to eat Thursday fried chicken lunches at Tattie's house (now your house) 
with Jim and the whole family.  Plus your mom and I used to spend the night 
at each other's houses when we were in elementary school.  I had heard 
through my sister Cara (who interviewed your grandad for a USTA publication) 
that you were heading to Enron upon graduation.  

I would love to visit with you about your experience so far at Enron.  Call 
my assistant, Patti Thompson, at x39106 and let's set up a time to get 
together.  Monday or Tuesday next week would be good.  I look forward to 
seeing you.  By the way, our oldest daugher, age 16, is Meagan Worthing

Ms. Beck,

My name is Ashley Worthing and I just started with Enron about 3 months ago.  
I was wondering if there is any possibility that your mothers name is Sue and 
her maiden name is Worthing?  If I am completely off, I apologize in 
advance...my father, aunt and uncles wanted me to see if I could find you, or 
if this is you.

Thank you,

Ashley Worthing

Tried you this morning from the car and missed you.  Do you want to talk 
Thursday morning during my commute?  I will be out of the office Friday, 
March 2 and Monday, March 5.  I will be a chaperone for my daughter's high 
school drill team to state competition in Dallas - really a Texas 
experience!  A great time to support her and be around her friends.   And 
nicely enough, she asked me to be a chaperone.  With 81 girls on the team, it 
will be loud, but fun.  --Sally

Subject: Do you want to reschedule a catch up ?



Shona and Mike Jordan had talked last week about pushing back the Doorstep 
review on the metals business in London and had agreed to take that out of 
the plan for Q1.  

As of last week, we have redirected Shona's reporting line to Beth Apollo.  I 
have asked Beth to review the doorstep review plan for all of 2001 and to 
recommend any changes in timing and approach.  Beth is in fact in Monterrey, 
Mexico today and tomorrow, completing a review of that office.  Soon after 
she returns, she will review and update the suggested doorstep review 
schedule.  After that has been updated, she will review the revised schedule 
with Rick Causey for any additional input and concurrence on the selection of 
key offices/businesses to review and the timing of such.  With Beth's 
knowledge of the businesses in London, I am sure we will benefit from her eye 
towards effective scheduling of the reviews.  I will be out of the office on vacation on Friday, March 2 and Monday, March 
5.  I will check messages at the end of both business days.  My assistant, 
Patti Thompson ( x35926) will have contact numbers for me.  Since I will be a 
chaperone for my daughter and 80 other girls from the high school drill team 
at state competition in Dallas, it is unlikely that I will be easily 
reachable during the day.  

I will be back in the office on Tuesday, March 6.   I made the decision last week to disband the Strategic Initiatives team which 
reported to Mary Solmonson within my organization.  The group was led by a 
director, and consisted of 2 managers, 1 senior specialist and 4 
specialists.  The employees were made aware of this decision last Friday 
afternoon.  My HR rep was on hand to explain the help that all will receive 
in finding new assignments within Enron through the Enron Corp. Re-deployment 
Team.  Mary Solmonson continues as one of my direct reports, focused on 
CommodityLogic and our business development efforts regarding the 
commercialization of mid and back office services.  

As part of my on-going effort to deliver both the best value and quality of 
service within Energy Operations, I reviewed core versus non-core activities 
within my team.  I am committed to investing appropriately in people 
resources to support core activities.  And I believe that we can become even 
more effective if investments in non-core activities are eliminated.    The 
role played by the Strategic Intiatives team in coordinating systems projects 
will be more appropriately shouldered by the IT project leads and the 
respective business sponsors/end users.  The "middle-man" role played by the 
Strategic Initiatives team had ceased to deliver appropriate value.  

I wanted you to be aware of my decision in case you hear anything about the 
re-deployment effort.  Certainly if we are able to generate revenue, that will be a great offset to 
our expenses.  At this point, we are working on a best, worst and most likely 
case for a revenue model, plus getting some teeth behind our up front costs.  
With this info, we can size the potential and then decide how to proceed.  

My first note to you around disbanding Joel's group was the best overall 
summary of reasons to disband the team.  In addition, Joel and his team had 
recently spent a couple of hours updating my direct report team on the 
projects in which they were involved.  The update had the exact opposite 
effect that Joel wanted, I am sure.  After the two hour session, it appeared 
to me that the team was probably overstaffed and still adding to its girth, 
fulfilling IT's roles in some cases, not communicating with the rest of my 
direct report team (if your role is be a liaison, then communication is a 
necessary component of the role), struggling to create a role for themselves, 
etc.  If my reaction had been to say "what a talented group - we have to 
figure out how to best utilize them", then the outcome might have been 
different.  But I also had concerns over quality of staff as well.  That two 
hour exposure created so much concern on my part that we were incurring costs 
for the team without commensurate value, that I couldn't in good conscious 
make any other decision after further investigation.  --Sally

Subject: Disbanding of Joel Henenberg's Team

I have a stretch goal for the operations budget under Enron Americas to 
reduce costs by the end of the year.  To this end, I have recently studied 
possible options for reaching the targeted savings.  To make the best 
decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of 
core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value 
proposition.

As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team.  
To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will 
lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end 
users.   

Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week.  
Our HR rep spent some time with the team explaining the corporate 
re-deployment service that they all will be working through over the next few 
weeks.  
Let me know if you have any questions regarding this.  While it was a tough 
decision, I feel comfortable having made it.

As a follow-up to our brief conversation earlier - 

Sally has enlisted the assistance of Marc Eichmann to build a revenue model 
for the Back Office Commercialization.  To prepare for that, Sally, myself, 
and James Scribner are meeting tomorrow to start to put together the 
assumptions and detailed information that Marc will need to build the model.  
We thought that you could probably offer some valuable insight to this 
process, so we would like for you to attend if you can.

We will be meeting in Sally's office - 3389, on Tuesday from 1:00 p.m. to 
3:00 p.m.

See you there!


Saturday was fun - it was nice I think for all of us to go to the shower 
together.  That was a nice group of women - and fun.  

Cara did tell me about the scrapbook idea and I think that it sounds good.  
Tell me what I can do to help you, but I am probably shorter on time than 
anything.  But if I can get you get addresses or whatever, let me know.  

Payment plan sounds fine.  I am not worried about the timing on that, so 
don't start this until you feel that it makes sense for you and your family.  
With the Viviance thing, you may prefer to defer the start of this until a 
little more certainty is on the horizon.  I can't think of a better place for 
the money to be invested than in you and your family.  

Austin would be fun - but I am glad that Houston is a reasonable distance for 
a day or weekend trip.  Not quite the same as being in town, though.  Maybe 
someday we will be there!  --Sally

Hey,
?
It was so fun being  with you on Saturday.? It is always nice when someone 
else spills--it is  usually me....
Actually do wish you  were closer...although I am grateful that you are no 
further than  Houston.
?
What did you think  of the scrapbook idea for Mom and Dad?? That is something 
that I could do  that would involve labor--will not be able to make a huge 
contribution  $-wise.? (If Cara did not pass on the scrapbook idea to you let 
me  know!)
?
Also, setup an  automatic payment each month to begin to pay you back.? It is 
a fairly  paltry sum ($35) at this point but wanted to at least get 
started....hopefully  will be able to increase it at some soon in the future.

As a result of the reorg announcement a couple of weeks ago, this report 
should now go to Philippe Bibi (or his assistant, Peggy McCurley).  Louise is 
now in the office of the chair of Enron Americas.  Philippe has assumed the  
role as chairman of Enron Net Works.  Since this report is a Net Works 
report, please remove Louise from the distribution list and add Philippe and 
Peggy effective immediately.  

Also, I would like to review and perhaps edit the principal projects/deals 
section each week before distribution.  What would be the most efficient way 
to get this done and into your hands in a timely way?  --Sally

Thanks for your nice note.  The promotion did get the year off to a nice 
start.  I am glad that you were pleased with the year end PRC process.  While 
time-consuming, I have appreciated the opportunity to get to know Associates 
like you whom I would perhaps otherwise not know.  Keep me posted on what you 
are doing.  --Sally

Sally,  

I just wanted to send a quick congratulatory note on your promotion to 
Managing Director.  And a bit belated, a thank you for serving again as my 
PRC representative.  I was pleased with my outcome at year-end, and once 
again, was one of the few Analysts or Associates who was always kept informed 
about the process.  I appreciate your time and energy in representing me.

Nicole

Thanks for much for your nice note.  Where are you working now?  I hate to 
say that I have lost track.  --Sally

Subject: Wholesale Deal Meetings

The following is from Mike Patrick:

Wes Colwell's Hot List Meetings have previously been held on Thursdays at 
1:30pm and attended by various parties.  This meeting has been replaced by 
the Wholesale Deal Meeting to be held at the same time and location.  The 
attendees will be comprised of each Wholesale Business Unit's CAO, 
Transaction Support lead, Tax lead and Energy Operations management.  The 
meeting will be held bi-weekly and will be adjusted as necessary.   Please 
note that the first meeting will be held tomorrow, Thursday February 22 at 
1:30pm in EB3321.

The purpose of this meeting is :

1) For the CAO/Transaction support lead to summarize the Top 3 deals for the 
quarter in each business unit, focusing on any potential issues that might 
derail the closing of the deal, and

2) For the Transaction Support team to update the group on any global 
accounting issues, and

3) To create/maintain a "Wholesale Critical Deal Sheet" comprised of 
Wholesale's Top Ten critical deals

The meeting is not intended to be a business unit administration meeting 
(i.e., floor space, SAP, etc.).  I believe Wes still plans to hold a 
Wholesale CAO meeting to discuss other non-deal issues.

Following are the dates of the upcoming meetings.  The meetings will be held 
from 1:30pm - 2:30pm in EB3321.

Brenda Herod is in charge of Energy Operations for EIM and should be included 
in the invitation list.  Brent Price fulfills two roles for EGM - CAO and 
head of operations, so he is appropriately included covering both fronts.  
Also, I had added Bob Hall to the previous Hot List meeting.  He is a VP in 
Energy Operations for Enron Americas.  I would like for him to be on the list 
for this meeting as well.  He and I will cover for each other on this 
Wholesale Deal Meeting.  You may get both of us in attendance on occassion, 
but usually it will be one or the other of us to cover operations for EA.  
Thanks. --Sally

First of all, allow me to express my congratulations for your promotion. I am 
following up on the conversation about structuring of the Commodity Logic 
initiatives you had with Greg Piper last week. How do you think we should go 
about looking into the projects? I remain at your disposal for any direction

Hey Sally,

Congrats,

E:mail messages says to check website to determine whether or not DSL is 
available at my home.  However, I don't see a spot on the website to check 
that information.  Can you provide more details?  Just remember that the DPR is used as an accounting tool as well. despite my 
constant reminders that it is a tool for reporting daily trading results and 
positions against board approved limits.  So do approach this as 
fact-finding; and then I would suggest reviewing any recommendations that you 
may have with Wes Colwell and the RAC group before any changes are made.  

Looks like a good group.  I hope that all will attend and participate.  Did 
Pam do some due diligence for you before sending this e:mail so that you know 
this date and time works for everyone?  

Keep me posted on progress.  --Sally

Subject: DPR - what it consists of, where it is going

I would like you to join me in discussing the DPR, this Thursday at 9:30am.  
Topics I would like to discuss are:

what is currently reported in the DPR (accrual vs mtm)
company/location groups - what we are currently not capturing
relationship with the risk policy
Economic vs earnings risk - what should be captured

I strongly encourage you to attend as your input will be very valuable in 
helping us determine how we should go forward.  Please let Pamela Sonnier

I need your help with a quick survey of how many interns you'd like to have 
this year.  Sally needs to forward this number to Rick Causey by noon 
tomorrow.  Please send me your rough count by 11:30 AM (Wednesday).

Thanks for your help,
Patti x39106Depending on others' schedules, Feb. 23 is good for me.  I will be out of the 
office on March 2.  --Sally

Subject: NABA photo shoot


EES and Sally Beck's organization in EWS are joining forces to underwrite
Enron's recruiting presence at the 30th Annual National Association of
Black Accountants National Conference and Job Fair this August in Dallas,
Texas.  NABA is an professional organization of 100,000 African Americans
in the fields of accounting, finance, consulting and IT.

We are planning a photo shoot of a check presentation to the Executive
Director of NABA, who is making a special trip to Houston for this purpose.
The photo and caption will appear in the pre-conference NABA newsletter to
its members (not a paid advertisement).  We would like to have Cindy,
Sally, Wes, Ted and the representative from EES in the photo, if possible.
We also need to decide whose signature should appear on the mocked up check
for the photo - what do you think?

We are checking on dates for the shoot now, and Debbie Nowak will be
contacting you/your assistants to check for your availability.  (likely
contenders are Feb 23 around mid-day and March 2)

We are excited about Enron's participation in this conference and look
forward to some great hires.

Thanks,

Gwynn


I am looking forward to involvement with the NABA and the prospect of hiring 
some strong candidates.  If you want me for the photo shoot, February 23 
looks good.  I will be out of the office on March 2nd - two days of vacation 
on March 2 and 5 to chaperone Meagan's drill team to state competition in 
Dallas.  With 90 girls on the team, that should be fun but exhausting!  

It was great to see you and Grady last night at the rodeo.  Let's definitely 
plan on a ball game in April as a chance to catch up.  I just checked the 
calendar, and it looks like we are on for lunch on March 28!!  A few weeks 
away, but at least it is on the calendar!  If your schedule were to free up 
suddenly, just give me a call and I can see if I could change mine to have 
lunch sooner.  --Sally

Sally - HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Sorry I missed your call last night; I
was walking with another prego from the office.

Your payment offer is very generous;  I"m sure we can work it out.  I have
no problem putting it on my card for now.  We have the go-ahead from Cindy,
too - so I think I will go ahead and confirm with Jeffrey's this week.  When
you come in next weekend, maybe we can all look at the sample menus, and get
that decided as well.

Maybe we should send a little "save the date" note to the cousins to let
them know?   I would be glad to do that.

Thanks for your input.   I bet I will talk with you later today, on your
special day!    -cara

I have only taken a quick look at the attachment, but thought that I would 
forward it to you.  Does it make sense?  $8MM in equipment charges for 
us???????  Does that include depreciation (which is not equipment)?  Can you 
give me the detail again on everything that falls under the "Consultant" 
line?  What is it and which RC's and RC owners have items there.  Thanks.

Subject: 2001 Group Expenses

Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
and evaluate/manage our risks.

Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
each group with these changes.



Regards
Delainey
I think that this looks pretty good, and don't know if we could better the 
cost too much by looking around.  Cara, would you like for me to hold the 
reservation on my credit card?  Don't know how much baby stuff may be hitting 
yours, so I would be glad to do so.  

I am real comfortable with sharing the costs of this dinner, but don't 
necessarily feel that we have to split it in thirds.  This is a good year for 
me to cover a large portion of the cost - when we did the 40th anniversary 
party, David and I  were not in such good shape and I think that Cindy and 
Richard covered a lot of the costs.  Things ebb and flow - 2000 was a good 
year at Enron and this would be a good time for me to put some of my reward 
to good use.  --Sally

Hi, sistas-

Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:

We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.

Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.

I confirmed "17" with mom.

Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,
dessert) is $45.
A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The
food sounds really good.

So, here's a guess at cost:
17 people at $45 =  $765
Beverages =        $200
Gratuity =   $193
Valet =    $  50
Room rental =   $200
TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into
thirds

What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with
this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really
want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to

Thanks for your vote of confidence.  I don't think that it is out of the 
realm of possibility.  As we know with all Enron reorg's, what we can count 
on is that this will change!  

We'll miss Delainey in Enron Americas, but as a shareholder I am glad that he 
will be at EES.  Have already had some discussions with him about some 
involvement there.  I will keep you posted.  --Sally

Sally -
When I heard the rumour this week about Louise Kitchen transferring out of 
Networks, I was hoping they'd say you were moving to the Office of the Chair 
at Networks!  Do you think a non-commercial MD will ever make it to Office of 
Chair?  If anyone can, you'll do it.

Subject: Organizational Changes

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John

Subject: photos as a gift?


I've just looked at some beautiful photos--hand colored done by our project
manager's wife--she is a professional photographer.  How would you all feel
about having a really good, artistic picture done of the three of us for a
gift to Mom and Dad?  Let me know--we could do it while Sally is here for

Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the 
mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale 
businesses.   (EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)  The controls around 
mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test 
- i.e. following the process and documentation around a series of 
transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.  
Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of 
explaining what we think happens.  Doing a deal test tells us what does 
happen.  And it is when there are differences between the controls that we 
believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where 
operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created. 

These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which 
Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen.  As such, they are purposely 
designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to 
produce less paperwork.  It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and 
potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that 
are valuable in these reviews.  These reviews also look  for ways to leverage 
success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class 
practices or practical solutions to shared problems.  Briefly, the doorstep 
review process would follow this set of steps:

 1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.  This 
is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be 
notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain 
that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town. 

 2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell 
them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in 
making information and personnel available to complete the review.  

 3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key 
commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and 
key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.  The 
deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process 
and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.  

 4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of 
the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those 
which may not be working as designed.  Potential action items are suggested.  
This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually 
very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support 
their business.   There are times when the head of an office will suggest an 
additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with 
this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support 
the growth of their business.  The doorstep team lets the head of the office 
know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing 
so. 

 5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be 
reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.  Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls 
and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.  Ted and I, 
assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate 
personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume 
responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and 
to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.  
Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey 
to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter, 
doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep 
findings and plans for the next quarter.  Through most of 2000, the doorstep 
teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each 
doorstep review.  This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me 
sometime late in 2000.  We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick 
before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular 
concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more 
timely manner than quarterly.   

Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in 
Germany.  Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors 
in charge of the scrap metal business.  Her impression was that they were not 
concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the 
integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were 
discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron's 
practices.  Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley 
was involved in that session as well.  At my suggestion, she also contacted 
Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.  I do not know what the timing was 
for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.  

Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from 
Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.  And if that was the 
case, I apologize for that.  While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I 
know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.  If you 
would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when 
they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as 
a clear step from this point going forward.   The out of the ordinary step in 
this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert 
them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the 
level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing 
directors.   I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and 
myself.   Although we had changed the process at year end so that the 
download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice 
mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a 
meeting with Rick and Rick.   This meeting should have been with Ted and me.  
In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona 
mentioned some concerns.  Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked 
for more detail.  She definitely covered both the teams findings and the 
integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.  We don't, however, control 
which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.  

To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the 
heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.  The effort here is 
to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to 
offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire 
Enron organization.  The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.   The 
findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations, 
which I believe is healthy.  We purposefully have chosen not to 
"over-wordsmith" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be 
surfaced through these reviews.  Frankly, I believe that these reviews can 
reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical 
perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.  

I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with 
you.  We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as 
valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.  Mike Jordan and certain 
members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other 
businesses outside EEL later in the year.  We are certainly open to any 
suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process.I will be working in the Calgary office Wednesday and Thursday, February 7 
and 8.  My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106) has numbers where I can be 
reached.  I will be back in the Houston office on Friday, February 9.

Entelligence is being used in Houston, so they must have done training here.  

Patti is setting up my meeting with James for Friday.  I just left her a 
message and asked her to let you know the time that is scheduled for - plus I 
will leave you a message after I have talked with him.  I hope to have that 
meeting with James at 10:30.  

Interruptions have been rampant - and I am still not finished with reviews.  
Shona will actually be in Calgary at the same time that I will be, so we will 
do her review on the plane, in the airport or at the hotel - and I will tell 
her about the reorg.  Again, I will leave you a message to let you know that 
we have had that conversation.  

That's great to have dinner with Lou.  I think that it would be good to find 
out from him what sort of interaction he has with the London office, what's 
working, what's not working - in an informal way.  Are they on an Enron 
network?  Do they get Enron e:mails?  How often does Lou go to London or 
someone from London mid office come to New York?  I still suspect that New 
York is somewhat neglected just because of the distance between London and 
New York and the fact that there seems to be plenty for Mike and his team to 
chew on in London.  Particularly now with a renewed focus on the scrap metal 
business.  

Enrjoy the OpRisk Conference.  They tend to be heavily attended by bankers 
and there focus is that direction as well, but there is a lot that we can 
glean from what they are doing.  It snowed there a lot yesterday.  Of course, 
according to Peggy Hedstrom, it is 0 degrees (daytime temp reading) and snowy 
in Calgary.  

I look forward to seeing you in Dallas.  --Sally

Will start to check into this.  I would like to see the training, so I can 
get familiar with the product.  Have they delivered it in Houston at all?

Thanks for the Heads up on James for Friday.  I will be in NY at the 
conference, but at least that clears the way for me to start getting busy 
when we get back from the ASE on Wed.

I am having dinner with Lou Colorusso, one of the Metals guys in NY on 
Thursday night.   Marcello declined.  Any issues you think I should discuss 
with him?   I know there is a doorstep outstanding for the NY office.  I will 
get the scoop from Shona on those results before I go.

How did Shona take the news yesterday.  I will wait for your go ahead to make 
contact with her on the re-organization.

Enjoy the trip to Calgary.  I will see you in Dallas on Monday morning.

Beth

Subject: EnTelligence Training

Please mark your calendars for EnTelligence Training on February 22nd.  
EnTelligence is a system developed by Enron that provides a prospecting and 
management reporting website combining information from internal and external 
systems.  New enhancements to the system now provide Activity Detail reports 
by counterparty.  It also contains Family Tree information for companies 
(i.e. subsidiaries, division of... etc.).  Avril Forster from the Houston 
office will be providing the training.

We will divide the training into three sessions on February 22nd  as follows:

10:00 - 12:00 Origination team training
1:30 - 2:30 Energy Operations team training 
3:00 - 5:00 Trading team training 

All training will be in the Video #2 boardroom (next to Liz Prior).  Please 
make every effort to attend this training.  Hopefully, you will find the 
EnTelligence system a useful tool for each of you.  If you have any questions 
or concerns, please let me know.











Kathryn Corbally (Senior Director currently in Investor Relations) is moving 
to Connecticut soon to join her husband.  He has been working up there for 
the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our 
weather derivatives team about a year ago.  She hopes to continue to work for 
Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I 
can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York 
office.  

It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn 
could be someone for you to consider.   She came originally from the London 
office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some 
feedback on her.  In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very 
early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.  She came to 
Houston and  has done a number of different things.  I think that she is well 
organized and control minded.  Understands Enron's business.  Managing a 
group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.  I am not sure that 
people enjoy working under her.  That could be old news, however.  There are 
a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her 
based on very recent experience.  Do you know of her?  

Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.  
Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.  She would 
definitely represent an Enron point of view.  They have two small daughters - 
she might be interested in something part time even.  Could mean lower cost 
that way.  

This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.  
If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you 
could go to for some fact finding around her.  Let me know.  --Sally   Itinerary for Sally Beck

easier for me if the meeting is at my house.  

Sarah would be great if the dads are not available for car care.  Hearing it 
from a woman's point of view would be interesting!  

I agree that it is too close to plan a dad's event for this weekend.  Another 
thought, continuing the baseball theme from last year, is to get tickets to 
an Astro's game.  I have season tickets through Enron and can buy blocks of 
tickets for games.  I have the schedule at home and I will check tonight to 
see if there is perhaps a pre-season game in March that would work.  We could 
discuss that and other suggestions at the meeting on Sunday.  

I will also bring info on other symphony dates - in case we have a large 
number of girls who will take the SAT on March 31.  If not too many are tied 
up, we could go ahead with the open rehearsal at 10:30, and then the girls 
who take the SAT could join us for lunch if they would like.  

Thanks for making the calls.  I am making up this quarter for only a little 
travelling at the end of the year.  Report from the Calgary office today is 
that it has snowed at that it is about 0 degrees (that is a daytime 
tempurature reading!).

I will call you on Thursday night when I am back in town.  I will leave with 
David the spreadsheet on offices held by the girls in past years in case that 
is needed while I am out of town.  --Sally

Sally:? I am refiguring this meeting...I have tried three  places and can not 
find a person willing to speak to us about car maintenance,  so I checked 
notes...you were correct, Pam Martins dad and Emily U. dad were  both 
volunteered by their wives, I will check them out this evening.? I  have call 
into Bob Lindsay, policeman and NCL dad, about safety.. we will  see.? I 
thought I might try to get some brief info from Ann YOung on  Applause 
Theatre, our new phil.? On nominations, there were a couple of  girls who did 
not complete info sheets last time, I will call them  tonight.? Also, I can 
check with the three on nominations and see when they  are available, will 
let you know.? If you don't mind having regular  ticktocker meeting at your 
house, that would be great.? If all else fails,  Sarah Marshall (yes, that is 
right) probably knows more about car care than  anyone I know...the girls 
call her if their car doesn't start.? Her theory  is that the first thing is 
to turn down the_______ radio as you are backing out  the drive, so you can 
hear your car...pretty basic.?
Summary:? Can we do TT meeting at your house?? I  will email agenda for that 
meeting to you.? I will have Abi check with  girls about nominations and let 
you know when they can meet...we will go from  there.? Is this okay with 
you.? This is the meeting I thought we might  dd Dad/ dtr but too close, so 
we better come up with another idea....dance  lesson, maybe...think Megan 
suggested that.? 
?
Have a good trip. Linda

FYI - I will meet with James on Friday when he is back from London to go over 
the change in reporting for him.  I gave his review the end of last week, but 
didn't get to review the reporting change.  I will ask Patti to let you know 
when I am meeting with James on Friday.  Wanted you to be in the loop on this 
- particularly when we are getting in front of commercial guys, I want this 
to be well done.  The training may be great - I just wanted to make sure that 
James knew about Avril's trip and that he was aware of the content and 
delivery on the training.  Looks like he still has some homework to do.

Subject: Recycling Summary Integration plan

Please find attached the summary integration plan that you requested during 
our debriefing last week. 

The first part of the table shows the controls objectives and the controls in 
place at 31 Dec 2000 when Enron Metal Recycling was divided into two halves: 
MGMR and Bergman.  Our overall controls assessment per risk at that stage was 
level 2 (below average controls).  

We have sumarised the implementation steps required to achieve an increase in 
controls assessment to level 3 (average), 4 (good)  or 5 (excellent) in each 
case,  along with latest completion dates to achieve those controls. 

We have then added a column of comments on the actual implementation with a 
bar chart to show how far advanced the work is.  The revised controls 
assessment at 31 Jan shows an average of 2.5 and our plan should enable the 
controls to be around a level 3 (average) by end of February. 

We will issue a revised table monthly in order to clearly update you on our 
progress.  If you would like to schedule a specific meeting to go through any 
of the points or queries that you may have, please let me know and I will 
organise.

Many thanks

Naomi

 
Please put Mike on my calendar for Thursday lunch next week. Steve and 
Richard are coming as well.  You might tell Mike that we can provide the two 
of them with desk space as well, but that we will reserve the spot with the 
computer and phone for Mike.  And schedule some time for me to meet with him 
on Thursday as well.  I will deal with Louise's meeting in another way.  

You might e:mail Mike and let him know that we have a spot for him with 
computer, network connection and phone on 33.  You might also offer to set up 
any appointments for him while is here.  Thanks.

Subject: Management of Accounting/Regulatory Reporting Functions

As you know, HPL is a gas utility subject to Texas Railroad Commission 
("RRC") jurisdiction, and as such HPL must comply with relevant statutes and 
regulations.  Two RRC regulatory reporting matters in which I have been 
involved are HPL's Gas Utility General Annual Report and tariffs.  I have 
concluded that the way in which these filings are accomplished, and 
particularly the information systems used in the processes, should be 
reviewed.  Mike Eiben and Bob Hall have also been involved in this process 
(although Bob came in only recently) and are much more familiar with the 
intricacies of the process and systems than I.  Rather than going into detail 
in this memo, I intend to set up a meeting soon for the addressees of this 
memo to discuss the situation.



Thanks for the info.  I am going to have to miss the luncheon tomorrow.  
Despite what seems to be a definite scheduling challenge, I am trying to do 
two lunches this week - one with operations personnel promoted to manager 
(about 15 of those) and one with operations personnel promoted to director or 
senior director (smaller group).  To make this work while the promotion 
announcements are still timely, we have had to schedule on Tuesday this week 
for one of the lunches.  I will get an update from Shona.

Thanks for the weather report.  I bought a good coat a couple of months ago 
with London and Calgary in mind.  Worked well in London two weeks ago, so I 
will come equipped with coat, gloves, scarf, etc.  

I can go either way on dinner for Wednesday night.  If it would be good for 
you to get home at a reasonable hour, then we can all three have an early 
supper.  (If I get in bed early my body would probably be in shock, but would 
adjust!)  Or if we don't want to feel rushed, then a drink with Laura sounds 
great.  Ask if her pronunciation in Spanish class is improved or impaired by 
alcohol.  I will let you all decide based on your commitments both inside and 
outside work - either way will work well for me.    --Sally

Just wanted to let you know that our weather has turned a little colder this 
week.  We have a little bit of fresh snow and the temperature is in the high 
20's, however with the windchill it's more like 20 F.  For dinner on 
Wednesday, Laura has a Spanish class at 7:00.  We have a couple of options.  
We could go to dinner at Joey Tomatoes right after the meeting at 5:00.  Or, 
we could go for a drink with Laura after the meeting and you and I could go 
to dinner afterwards. My preference would be to eat earlier rather than 
later, but I'm pretty flexible.  Let me know which works better for you.

Please print Wellesley schedule - I think that I have a conflict with the 
date that they need me.  Let's discuss.

This was our first third party auction.  Although we had some major technical

Hello folks -

As we discussed in the initial sponsor meeting, we would like to have a 
preliminary walkthrough of the ASE Studio Workshop draft agenda.  We are 
targeting this discussion for either Tuesday or Wednesday morning and will 
need about 1 to 1 1/2 hours for a thorough review.  Please let me know when 
you can meet and I will arrange the logistics.

Thanks
Lisa P

I had the same reaction.  We didn't get much of a break between the January 
and February meeting!  Was it car care and car safety that we had planned for 
Feb?  And do we have a volunteer to host the meeting?  I could certainly host 
if needed.  Did you have a constable or someone in mind to talk with the 
girls about car safety?  I would be glad to call them and make arrangements 
if you let me know.  Any ideas on car care?  Seems like Joy Martin mentioned 
her husband as a possible "expert" there.  Or should we try to call Firestone 
or Jiffy Lube or one of those spots to get a speaker?  I am headed to Calgary 
for Wednesday and Thursday this week, but can make plenty of phone calls 
before I leave.  

On nominating committee, I have a list of offices held over the years by the 
girls that will be needed by the nominating committee.  I would be glad to 
meet with the girls on the committee either Thursday night (I land from 
Calgary around 6:00 pm), Friday night or Saturday.  I can get you this list 
if you need to meet with the committee before then.  It may be tough to get 
the girls together, but am I correct in assuming that they need to present a 
slate at our Feb meeting and then they vote in March?  

The symphony open rehearsal sounds good - 10:30 am on Saturday, March 31; buy 
tickets at the door ($4).  Problem is that SAT's are given that day.  Meagan 
is signed up to take them.  I wonder how many others may be taking the SAT 
that day?  If there are only a few conflicts, we could go ahead and it's okay 
if Meagan misses.  If we have a lot of conflicts, then this may not work.  
Maybe we could get Merritt to e:mail this question to the girls when she 
contacts them about this weekend's meeting.  They could check their schedules 
and then we could get a count.  I will also look into other possible dates 
and get availability and prices on tickets just in case.  

I will try to call you after a lunch time meeting today.  --Sally

Subject: Fundamental Operating Standards

Attached for your review are the fundamental operating standards and controls 
that have been developed by the Wholesale Services group.  These standards 
are to be met by all Enron offices and by each functional group within the 
operations process.  Qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic 
measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity.  
Statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored 
on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately.

As business unit heads, you play a critical role in working with Operations 
to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively.  Please 
review this document and let me know if you have any questions or wish to 
discuss further.

Regards,

Brent



I will be in the Calgary office with Peggy Hedstrom and her team next week on 
Wednesday and Thursday, February 7 and 8.  

Do either one of you have a specific issue that needs to be addressed that I 
could handle while I am in Calgary?  My agenda with Peggy and her team is 
pretty full, but I can add to that anything that you know of that we need to 
address.  Just let me know. 

That puts me in Calgary for the staff meeting on Wednesday.  I will sit in 
with Rob Milnthorp on the video conference for the first hour of the 
meeting.  I already had a meeting scheduled with all of Peggy's team during 
the second hour of your staff meeting.  Due to location constraints, we will 
have to keep that meeting as scheduled.  So I will have to step out of the 
staff meeting for the second hour.  Seattle sounds nice.  Haven't made it there myself.  Enjoy the trip.  If you 
have time, I would love to get with you late next week to discuss my thoughts 
about next steps for Joel's team.  --Sally 

Also, when you are back, I would love to set up a meeting with you and some 
of my direct reports so that we can get an update on IT priorities.  We are 
addressing some issues that create operational risk that may require some 
system enhancements to help us mitigate those risks, and we would like the 
opportunity to share those with you in the context of priorities for systems 
work.

In my new role as social secretary for James, I wanted to let you know that 
he will be in London next week on business.  He will arrive on Monday morning 
(February 5) and should be in the Enron office  most of the day on Monday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday.  He will fly back to Houston on Thursday.  He has 
dinner plans for Wednesday evening, but would love to get together with you 
for dinner on Monday or Tuesday, if you are in town and available.  He will 
be staying at the Sheraton Belgravia Hotel - walking distance to Enron 
House.  Best way to contact him at Enron's London office would be through 
Mike Jordan or his assistant.  Mike's number (don't know how many of these 
digits you actually need to call from there) is 011-44-207-783-4703.  

Hope you guys get to see each other.  Have a great weekend.  --Sally Julie called me immediately after getting my e:mail message about you.  Her 
role has changed once again at  Enron!   She is running more of a 
fundamentals group at present.  Wanted to know if you would be interested in 
that.  Told her that I couldn't speak for you.  I'd suggest that you contact 
her and talk with her even if at first blush that may not be your first 
interest.  Can't hurt to hear about what she is doing and spend some time 
with her.  You may not then be interested in her rotation, but you'll know 
more and she will know you.  

FYI - she is a University of Nebraska graduate.  --Sally I asked Mike this week if your baby was here, and he said that you had just 
returned to the office.  Congratulations on the birth of your little girl.  I 
hope that all three of you are surviving those first few weeks of adjustment 
and that sleep is not too short a commodity in your house!   I will look 
forward to seeing pictures of Lauren when I am next in London.  You do know 
that now that you are a dad that it is a requirement to be armed with 
adorable pictures at all times?!
--Sally Enjoy a well-deserved afternoon off.  I appreciate your notes when you are 
out on who to contact.  Have a great weekend.  --Sally

Just a quick note to see how you are doing.  I mentioned your name today to 
Kristin Albrecht.  She is a Senior Director over Risk Management for Enron 
Broadband Services (EBS).  Kristin and I used to work together in Enron 
Americas, and we had lunch today to catch up.  She grew up in Wharton and is 
an A&M graduate, so it occurred to me that you two have at least two things 
in common.  I wanted you to know that I have given Kristin your name.  She 
can be another contact for you here at Enron.  If you are interested in what 
is going on at EBS or want to get Kristin's impressions on rotations within 
or outside EBS, she would be great for you to visit with.  

Drop by soon to give me an update on life at Enron for you.  --Sally Along with Mike McConnell, I am active in recruiting for Enron's Analyst 
Program at the University of Oklahoma.  We became involved in recruiting 
there two years ago when I learned about a targeted undergraduate program 
that seemed like it could be a good fit for our program.  OU transformed 
their old PLM (Petroleum Land Management) program into the Energy Management 
Program in the School of Business.  This undergraduate degree retains the 
geology, business law and other specialized classes that were part of the PLM 
program, but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a 
trading floor course.  With the added plus of many of these students growing 
up in or around "energy" families in Oklahoma or Texas, I thought that 
recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to Enron.  Our 
recruiting efforts at OU continue to be successful and our OU Energy 
Management graduates have done well at Enron.  

Our first hire from OU (and the top Energy Management student) was Jody 
Crook.  He joined the analyst program last February after a December 1999 
graduation.  His first rotation has been on my team, working as a risk book 
administrator in gas trading.  He is in the process of looking for a second 
rotation at the end of February, and I think that he is someone that you 
should consider for a rotation on your team.  In addition to this last year's 
risk experience at Enron, Jody worked as a landman for two summers for 
Burlington Resources.  

I was very involved in recruiting Jody to Enron.  I think very highly of him, 
and want to be sure that he has good rotations while in the Analyst program.  
His background and your business seem to be a good fit.  Please visit with 
Jody as he contacts your group about a rotation.  It will be well worth your 
time.  

Thanks.

I couldn't agree with you more.  Mike missed the point of our phone call this 
week.  It was not to discuss the fine points of doorstep process or 
etiquette!  The point was ownership of an integration process and deadlines 
that were missed.  And how telling that when asked bluntly about his comfort 
level with controls for US operations that Mike's response was a deferral to 
Marcelo.  I have a one-hour conference call set up with Mike tomorrow.  This 
is one of the things that we will discuss.  --Sally

Cassandra,
I think Michael's issue is just one for you and Shona to worry about and try 
to simultaneously come up with a way to diffuse without bastardizing the 
process. .  I continue to say the we need to maintain the theme that speed 
and "gut reaction" is preferable to consensus and prosecutable evidence,  I 
feel so strongly about this that I would consider removing my team from 
involvement if politically correct, grammatically sound and properly 
researched reports that do not say anything or are stale or are full of 
ambiguity are the end result (see the internal audit report on 
Helsinki!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!).   I think the solution is make it clear that these reports are not to 
be used for prosecution but frank discussion.
I am right about this.
Please forward this to Shona/Sally/Mike or anyone else at your discretion 
(this is a compromise between Evil Ted and Zen Ted)

I certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database 
should flow to update GCP.  I assume that you have talked with both Mary 
Solmonson and James Scribner about this process to understand the details.  
They are the logical experts for that discussion.  Your memo is a little 
vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have 
not taken the time to talk with the best sources, I would suggest spending 
time with James and Mary so that you and they are appropriately informed.  

Absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to GCP.  I 
believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from 
Entelligence into GCP.  James and Mary (I refer to both because James has 
only recently assumed Mary's duties within Global Databases) can best discuss 
how this process works.  If you are aware of specific concerns around this, I 
know that James and Mary will want to hear that from you.  As is to be 
expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number 
of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all 
of the tasks that we do.  Your input will help James in making sure that 
priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues 
that we have.  I recognize the challenge that Credit must be facing in 
aggregating exposures in our market environment today.  With your input, we 
will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ 
deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible.

Subject: Information in Entelligence vs Global Counterparty

Sally,

I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
put forth in  "cleansing" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 

What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?

It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
population efforts.

 Your comments and ideas are welcome. 

Debbie

I received this resume through some contacts in the Houston chapter of the 
National Society of Hispanic MBAs.  He is interested in Enron, period.  (I 
called him to clarify his interests:  he is happy for an opportunity to use 
his bilingual skills, and is therefore interested in Enron Europe and Latin 
America, as well as Houston.  He is perfectly content to stay in Houston, 
though.)  

Let me know if this resume looks interesting to you.  Also, who should I send 
this to in London?

Gwynn,
First I would like to introduce myself.  My name is Javier Fernandez and I am
the Treasurer of the National Society of Hispanic MBA's Houston chapter.

I had a meeting with Martha Salinas and Kornel Rost this past weekend and
they mentioned that you are looking for bilingual MBA's to help with
European operations.  I am attaching my resume for your review.

As my resume shows, I have an MBA in International Business and am a CPA in
the State of Texas.  I have several years experience in finance and am
looking for something that meets my background.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments and
thank you very much for your time.

Best Regards,
Javier Fernandez

I think it would be great if you could attend on both dates.  However, the 
more important of the two would be March 6 as that would allow you to hear 
the students interview and assess their skills.

There is a slim chance that Mike could attend the event in April.  Jody Crook 
plans on attending that event, too.  I will be at both events, so there will 
be an Enron face at both events.

Please let me know if you will be available.

Thank you,

Mike and Sally:

I have been in contact with Ted Jacobs and have volunteered $1500 in 
scholarship funds to be awarded by Enron this spring.  By volunteering this 
money, we are now able to attend scholarship interviews on Tuesday, March 6 
on campus.  This will provide us with the opportunity to target candidates 
for next fall and lay the groundwork for a more competitive future.

After we have identified our scholarship recipients, we are invited to 
present our awards at the Scholarship Awards Banquet on Friday, April 20.  

Ted will (if he has not already) approach you, Mike, to see if you are 
interested in playing a role at this event.   If you are available to attend, 
please let me know.  I plan to have at least 2 Enron representatives at the 
event.

I just wanted to give each of you these details to keep you fully informed of 
our efforts on campus.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please let 
me know.


Thank you,

Sally - I had a chance to meet with Norma Tidrow today.  Norma is currently 
the Corp. Secy. at Azurix.  I worked closely with her in the International 
business and have a very high regard for her work.  Norma's background is as 
a senior legal specialist.  She has advanced to a Director level at AZX.   I 
believe she would be a very strong candidate for the right job within Enron.  
She is a very quick learner, and her documentation and process-oriented 
skills are exceptional.  Pls. expect a call from her to discuss 
opportunities.  Thanks for your consideration!  Paula
I will look forward to talking with Norma.  Thanks for suggesting that she 
contact me. --Sally

Subject: OU Scholarships

Mike and Sally:

I have been in contact with Ted Jacobs and have volunteered $1500 in 
scholarship funds to be awarded by Enron this spring.  By volunteering this 
money, we are now able to attend scholarship interviews on Tuesday, March 6 
on campus.  This will provide us with the opportunity to target candidates 
for next fall and lay the groundwork for a more competitive future.

After we have identified our scholarship recipients, we are invited to 
present our awards at the Scholarship Awards Banquet on Friday, April 20.  

Ted will (if he has not already) approach you, Mike, to see if you are 
interested in playing a role at this event.   If you are available to attend, 
please let me know.  I plan to have at least 2 Enron representatives at the 
event.

I just wanted to give each of you these details to keep you fully informed of 
our efforts on campus.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please let 
me know.


Thank you,

Jeff,

Deal QN2026.1 (EOL 803898) was booked on 01/24/2001 -  Enron Buys 15000/d 
Feb. 01 at 6.90.  Deal QN2004.1 is a duplicate of this deal.  Deal QN5772.1 
was booked on 01/25/2001 - Enron Sells 15000/d Feb. 01 at 7.115.  The booking 
of QN5772.1 generated positive revenue of $90,300.  Annuity deal QN2026 
paying Hess $45,143 was booked tonight.

Thanks,

Errol


Glad to hear that we are getting there.  Josephine's House (Jeffery's annex) 
is really good.  They do a great job of serving.  At past Enron dinners, they 
have printed menus specific for the occassion - really nice looking and a 
nice keepsake.  Maybe we can do this.  --Sally

Heya...

Richard has lunch with dad today.  Richard asked him about the anniversary
thing.  He said he thought with all that was going on a nice dinner rather
than a trip sounded good....I guess we're reaching consensus at last....will
nail down Mom for sure tomorrow night, find out who she wants to invite and
the make the reservations at the Jeffrey's annex place...

She will check with Dad and let you know?????  I don't quite get all of this 
either. 

Do you think that she might have been hoping that Dad would come up with a 
plan?  (Despite her comment that they were not "celebratory" about the 
occassion.)  Who knows...

Keep me posted - and please do me the favor of shaking me if I get like that

Sally,

I talked to mother last night about the dinner idea---boy is she hard to
read on this--told her out idea about a dinner in town and that she might
want to invite cousins--told her we probably wanted to go ahead a reserve it
because June was a busy time---she said she'd talk to Dad and then let me
know!!!????!!!????

As an aside, Brigeda's school year will be extended a week--until 6/1
because of losing a week for the air quality testing--so am not sure if we
could have made the N.C. deal anyway....

If I get to be like Mom or Dad, smack me around, ok?

Cindy




Thanks for your help on getting Chris Hanz lined up to talk with Chris 
Hoyle.  If you don't get anyone to talk with John Rodgers, don't worry about 
it.  I may have someone that could talk with him from the EnronOnline team.

I have arranged for Chris Hoyle to meet with Chris Hanz, Sr. Director 
Business Analyst at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow in EB1812.  Lexi is going to bring 
Chris to the 18th floor and pick him up at 11:30.  I am still trying to

that we have one of our office visit events taking place during that time.

A "Doorstep" inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our 
procedures and apparently this business is a disaster!!! We need immediate 
action on this up to and including shutting it down. This was the worst we 
have seen at Enron and I don't even want to put in this email what I heard 
was going on there. 

We need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster, if there 
isn't one already. I'll speak with Rick Causey here about what immediate 
action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better. 
More to come.

Just checked with Richmond Hill Inn in Asheville and they are open over 
Thanksgiving.  Not filled yet for that time period.  They are sending me a 
brochure.  Only potential draw back there is that most of their rooms have 
only king size beds and sleep two persons.  There are 2 rooms that have two 
beds, and two cottages that have sleeper sofas.  They do have baby beds.  
Families of 2 or 3 can be accomodated fine.  I would probably take two rooms, 
one for the girls and one for Tyler, David and me.  But we would probably do 
that in New York or San Francisco, too.  As we all know, five is almost too 
many in one room and bathroom.  

I think that dinner in Austin on June 2 and a trip at Thanksgiving sounds 
like a good plan.  Do you guys want to cover that with Mom and Dad and ask 
about the San Antonio/Sun City crowd?

Hello, Sista -

Sally and I spoke this morning (I know you guys spoke last night as well) -
and here's the latest idea:

Since August, Sept., and Oct.  are pretty much impossible for a trip, how
about we schedule a trip - possibly to NYC or San Fran. - during
THanksgiving.  This seems ideal since we always get together anyway at that
time - and nobody will have to remove kids from school.  Sally thinks maybe
we could travel Tuesday - Saturday and avoid some of the Thanksgiving travel
MADNESS.  Also, it pushes the travel even further into the year, which may
help you.

Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere in
Austin.  We can include Maryann and Fabe and San Antonio cousins IF mom and
dad would like that.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Then, we can have a family dinner for Mom and Dad on June 2 somewhere in
Austin.  We can include Maryann and Fabe and San Antonio cousins IF mom and
dad would like that.

Thoughts?   -Cara

Dear Mrs. Beck,

Thank you very much for the invitation.
I'm excited to tour Enron field because even though I am from Houston, I have
yet to attend an Astro's game.  I look forward to attending, and I thank you
for supporting our Energy Management program at OU.

Sincerly,
Heather Pinkerton

I hear that Dad was in the emergency room for some hours earlier this week.  
Glad to hear that it just seemed to be a virus.  Mom does seem to like that 
Heart Hospital...

Check out the website for the place in Asheville, NC that I mentioned to 
you.  Address is richmondhillinn.com - if I knew how to hotlink for you I 
would, but I am not the techie!!  We had dinner there one night while in 
Asheville and had a great meal and though that the place was pretty -  a lot 
better than the overpriced, under-delivered Grove Park Inn.  Our friends the 
Tylers spent several nights at the Richmond Inn that same summer.  It looks 
pretty good in the photos, and you can see the mountains!!

Only airlines that fly from here into Asheville are Delta and US Air.  
Continental flies to Greenville/Spartanville, SC which is about 60 to 70 
miles from Asheville - not impossible, given that we would want some cars.  

I will get info on prices and stuff for lodging and airfare - then we can 
decide if we want to show this to Mom and Dad as a possibility.  

Hope all is well with the three of you.  Are you making the trip to 
Halletsville on Saturday, assuming no rain out?  I am not going to make it - 
need a little r&r at home and to wash some clothes!!  Love, Sally Congratulations to you and Lanettte on the birth of Nicole Mackenzie.  What a 
pretty name!  I was in London last week and got the news while I was there.  

I hope that everyone in your household is doing well, although I know that 
you are probably a bit sleep deprived.  That will pass - although with your 
first one that is really hard to believe.  Please stop by as soon as you have 
pictures.  I would love to see them.  --Sally Melissa Allen, formerly with Arthur Andersen and assigned to the Enron 
account, has taken over Beth Apollo's role for EEL.  She reports to Fernley 
Dyson, as did Beth.

I was in the London office last week.  As a result of some of my discussions, 
Mike Jordan asked that James Scribner make a visit to cover the operations 
pricing model and to discuss some issues around global counterparty 
database.  Mike has suggested that James come to London during the first week 
in February, which sounds as if it will coincide with your trip.  Please 
coordinate with James so that your agendas are in sync (in case of potential 
overlap) so that we don't convey a right hand/left hand lack of 
coordination.  Since your agenda mentions GCP, there may some meetings that 
you are planning that would be appropriate for James to join.  By copy of 
this memo, I am asking James to do the same with you.  Thanks.

Greetings Sally!  Thank you for taking the time to attend our presentation, I 
truly hope you found it informative.  I definitely have a better 
understanding of your concerns with Risk and we will work towards resolving 
some of them.  Hopefully I can report some positive results at our next 
presentation.

I have a trip planned for London the week of Feb. 5.  My initial topics 
include:

GCP - NG Several meetings scheduled with Brian Lindsey Hunter and Gail Hill 
to discuss User Acceptance Testing, Test Scripts, Resources and Schedules.  

Global Systems Facilities and Contracts - Discussions with Gail Hill, Matthew 
Allen and others as identified to discuss Scope, Timing, Resources and 
Regulatory requirements.

Livelink/iRIMS - Discussions with Paul Jones regarding Vendor support,, 
Security Standards (Requirements and Elaboration), differences in security 
between Livelink and iRIMS, Standards Committee, current project status, 
testing, release of new versions, change management control, enhancements and 
processes.

Steve Whittiker (Michael Jordan sometimes joins us) -  System initiatives 
London and Houston, MKM, Envision, Global Systems.

I would also like to meet with Beth Apollo's successor if possible.  
Hopefully you can tell me who that is.



Regards

Joel

Attached is a memo from Mark Breese on the follow-up to the Jan. 25 VNG 
Meeting.




I do know Jana.  She has worked in various positions within my group for 
years since she joined us in the analyst program.  She has not been the 
strongest player.  Her level of accuracy has not been what we would have 
liked in many of the roles that she has played for us (confirmations and 
settlements).  And despite feedback, she is one of those players that just 
has never quite viewed her performance level in the same light that we see 
it.  She currently supports trading operations for South America, reporting 
to Martha Stevens under Scott Mills.  Let me check with Scott on his thoughts 
about her current performance and on her in an HR role.  I will let you know 
what he thinks.  It may be to date that we just haven't had Jana in the right 
role for her.  If I remember correctly, she was originally a teacher who went 
back to school to get a business degree.  Very sweet, pleasant to work with 
and personable.  I will get back with you after I have talked with Scott, or 
I may have him leave you a message.

Thanks for your note.  Sorry that all we managed last week was a wave.  My 
last trip to London was March of 2000, so I certainly had a very full 
agenda.  Mike Jordan kept my schedule very full, but productive, and even 
lunches and dinners were filled with business meetings.  

Do stop by when you are in the office next week.  I should be in town all 
week.  --Sally

Thanks for the congratulations.  David of course is pleased about the 
promotion but is most anxious to see what dollars come along with it!  
Thanks, too, for your comments on the OpRisk session.  It is always a risk to

Subject: Congratulations, etc...................

First of all congratulations on your promotion, it is well deserved.  You are 
really in some rarefied air, since there seem to be very few Managing 
Directors.

I also would like to compliment you on putting together one of the best  2 
1/2  hour seminars / workshops that I have ever attended ( I know that is 
saying a mouthful).  The Operational Risk Meeting / Workshop was not only 
informative, but the constantly changing formats kept everyone's attention.   
I believe the meeting also caused a renewed enthusiasm among your supervisory 
personnel.  This is not only my observation, but the feeling of all of the 
people that I have talked to over the past few weeks. 

Once again, congrats.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We are set up for the meeting on Operational Risk on February 6th at 3:00 
pm.  We have a room booked at the Sheraton with a set up similar to the 
Houston meeting.  I have invited three people from the accounting department 
to attend as well.  Laura Scott, Cheryl Dawes, and Dave Hanslip will be the 
attendees from accounting.  Everyone is looking forward to meeting with you 
to discuss this issue.  So far, the weather is still mild.  Talk to you soon.
Peggy


During the budgeting process for 2001 I gave Dave Delainey an estimated cost 
savings for Energy Operations assuming the sale of HPL. Since this is clearly 
on the horizon, we need to take a close look at opportunities for cost 
savings and our estimated timing on those savings.  I will ask James by copy 
of this memo to set up a meeting late this week to cover this.  I want to be 
able to get back with Dave with more detailed estimates of cost savings.  Audience for the report?  Is it you and Philippe, or will the report be 
distributed to all on your memo distribution list?  May make a difference in 
information provided.  

We can update you on progress toward commercialization of mid and back office 
operations in the report.  Would you also like some operating data - # of 
deals, bcf scheduled, etc.?  We can come up with a format and suggested 
content this week.  --Sally

Sorry I missed you yesterday  -- I tried a couple of times to catch you, but 
you were always in a meeting.

I will see you on Monday the 29th.  If anything comes up next week, I can be 
reached at my new temporary home (mother in-laws)  713 520 0766

Also  -- I believe Fernley has passed the Merit raise part of this year end 
comp review over to you, so I thought I would give you the facts.

Base salary $165,000
Foreign Adjustment  $30,000     these two items will go away on Jan 28th  --- 
and I am left with the base salary
Car Allowance           $12000

total regular pay     $207,000

also  -- they have had me on a 2 year contract  (not sure if they do that in 
Houston, but I am willing)  which had some annual cash kickers)


We can discuss when I get there, but in case you need it next week, just 
thought it couldn't hurt.


Looking forward to a fresh start and new challenges.


see you soon

Beth
Can you get me info on the options with Dell?  I won't make it by to speak

Silly as it may seem, have Brian Heinrich dig up a copy of the form that we 
used last year for headcount addtions.  Let's complete those for these 
positions and have Fred and Scott Neal sign them.  They need to understand 
the addtional cost associated with these requests.  They will forget later in 
the year if they aren't making much money.  

Do you agree that these positions are needed and will add value?  --Sally

Subject: Fred Lagrasta - Origination

Sally -

Fred would like me to hire an additional person to strictly focus on his 
deals across all commodities.  He says that his people don't have time to 
look at these reports.  Also,  Scott Neal wants 11 new physical books on the 
east region.  This will require at least two more risk people,  and probably 
two new OA people.  We told him that yesterday,  and he was fine with that.

Haven't had the chance to look at the UT presentation yet.  That will make 
good airplane material tomorrow.  If I make any changes I will try to fax 
pages to you after David picks me up at the airport tomorrow.  If I don't 
make chanages, I will call you Friday afternoon after landing and let you 
know that.  My schedule has been really full here, but very productive.  

Thanks for your comments.,  I must admit, I am really excited about the 
promotion.  We can talk next week about what I hope to accomplish during this 
next year and where my major focus will be.  It will be helpful for you to 
know and understand that as we work together to make that happen.  I am 
certainly glad that you are here - my flight to London reminded me of your 
arrival about this time last year as I was heading to London.  Luckily a 
different reason for the trip this year, but still hectic.  I expect it to be 
a busy year.  

You will notice that I have blocked some times on my calendar to get reviews 
written and delivered.  Target is to be finished  by the end of January .  

I will talk with you on Friday afternoon and see you on Monday.  --Sally

Sally,

Have you had a chance to look at UT presentation for Monday?  I will need to 
email final copy to Lexi by Monday morning (her flight is 2:00 PM) and she 
would like a cd for backup.  I can handle that.  She has supplied me with new 
dates for last page.  If you get a chance to review - just fax pages to me at 
713-345-8100.  If not, I can work on it monday morning.

Again, I am so happy for you.  It's such a BIG deal to be promoted to MD.  
Please share any thoughts you might have with me on how this affects my role 
as your assistant and what I can do to better assist you.  You know, this job 
that I have now with you is the job I have waited for all my life.  It is 
challenging, fast-paced, and has a lot of potential for growth.  You make me 
feel like I the work I am doing is important and valuable.   I have an 
enormous amount of respect for you as a person and of the work that you do 
and know that I am extremely lucky to have this job.

Technology is wonderful - I can log on here in the London office just as I do 
in Houston.  I feel very in touch.  Sounds like you have been busy - I think 
that the variety of items for the Sunday meeting sounds good.   Thanks for 
taking care of all of this.  

London is cold but sunny - so very nice.  I do love coming here - hope to 
make the trip once a quarter this year.  I will be back at home by Friday 
evening, so let me know if there is anything that I can do before the 
meeting.  Otherwise I will see you on Sunday. 

Too bad that Nancy doesn't want the input from  the girls on presentation.  I 
think that taking likes and dislikes would be good - no commitment to make 
changes that the girls' might suggest, but I think that it would be wonderful 
to have their input.  They are the honorees.  Oh, well .....as you say, this 
is volunteer work and probably not worth getting too worked up over the whole 
thing.  --Sally

Sally:? Hope all is well in London, it could not be more  "soupy", rainy or 
overcast than it has been here.? Sunday is shaping  up...Nancy at Elegant 
Accessories by Nancy has a presentation for us, but is  unable to give it due 
to market or show or something.? I will pick it up  from her and run through 
it on Sunday.? I am trying to get Debbie VanDyke  to do Habitat and the lady 
from Applause to come.? Have been working on  form for Nominations...The 
meeting is at Nancy Galante's house, I have spoken to  her about the girls 
listing favorite things from Sat. pm and she was (nicely)  opposed to that, 
as the girls really only get limited choices---oops.? She  did tell me, 
however, that three girls have already selected dresses...(are we  already 
behind?) and she will speak briefly on dresses and registration and ask  for 
questions.
At Mondays patroness meeting (which was pretty non-newsy), I  gave all Jr. 
moms a "heads-up"? that March meeting would be at dress  shop,or bridal shop, 
and that they would be invited, just for scheduling  purposes.
?
I have spoken with Barb Lindsey..a NCL member whose husband is  with Houston 
Police Dept.? He is realitivly cool, as far as a dad police  combo, but does 
have girl and boy twins in college, so he knows  teen-agers.? He is willing 
to talk to girls about what to do in case of  accident, when to leave your 
car, safety and so on...thought we could tie that  in with car maintenance 
meeting.
?
I will let you know as the Sunday plans progress, I am afraid  that this is 
going to be a "catch-all".? Know you are busy, no need to  respond, call 
Friday pm or Saturday if you have questions.
?
Linda

Please let me know if this is not what you wanted.




The flight was uneventful, although I didn't sleep very much.  Weather here 
is cold but clear, so I am enjoying it.  Very useful trip - they have my 
schedule very full, including dinners every night.  I will be in the office 
through end of day Thursday, and then dinner with Fernley Thursday night.  I 
will be in route to Houston on Friday - catching a 9:00am flight (told the 
kids that I would be at the airport at 2:00 am Houston time to start back 
home).  

We are not going to follow the Kean/Olson memo on communicating ratings.  We 
will only communicate Needs Improvement and Issues.  There will be differing 
messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need to hear 
that they are not performing at a high enough level relative to peers to help 
us achieve business goals or for them to considered for a bonus (may need to 
find another role within or outside Enron which is a better fit).  Message to 
someone new to Enron in that category should be different.  Glad they are 
here; believe that as they learn the organization and their job that they 
will be able to make significant contributions; doing the right thing to 
learn the business, but that contributions to date are not significant enough 
to warrant payment of a bonus...

Thanks for getting everyone on the same page on this.  --Sally

   >33589I assume that this request relates to corporate functions under Rick.  As of 
this moment, my team and I have not yet been granted access to merit 
information in the comp system.  I am in London this week, but have been in 
touch with my HR rep each day.  Latest word is that he aniticipates that we 
will be able to access merit worksheets sometime today.  Our deadline to 
submit merit increases is Monday, January 22.  SInce it is already after 
lunch on Wednesday here in London and we do not yet have access to the

Subject: Merit - Action requested

Rick has asked that I help him ensure that we all finish up our merit 
increases in time for the new deadline of this Friday, January 19.

1.  Could you please "submit" by the end of the day tomorrow, Wednesday, 
January 17?  Then Rick and I can review and get back with you with any 
changes.  

2.  If you could leave me a voice mail or eMail when you are finished, I 
would appreciate it.  I am moving back to the Enron building and will get 
back my old number (X36641) effective tomorrow.

3.  In addition, we are interested in your thoughts on the merit process 
overall, both for yourself and for your groups.  In general, it seems like a 
lot of "administration" for some pretty small numbers.  What are your 
thoughts - do you like the current process or would less frequent, larger 
increases be preferable (assuming we could make that change in the larger 
overall Enron framework)?

Please call me or Andrea Yowman (x31477) with any questions.  Thanks for your 
help!

I am in the London office this week, so I won't be able to attend.

Happy Hour

Please join us for a CommodityLogic Off-site January 17th at Kenneally's 
begining at 6:00pm.
We will be welcoming all the new additions to the team and saying farewell to 
those who have moved off to other projects.  Please plan on attending.  If 
you have any questions, please contact Maria x35586 or Brenda x31914.

See you there! 

Congratulations on the baby - August seems like  a long time away, but given 
how quickly time passes at Enron, you will be there before you know it.  I 
would be glad to visit with you about other opportunities at Enron sometime.  
I am in the London office this week, but will be back in the office the week 
of the 22nd.  Give Patti a call if you would like to get together and visit 
about options.  --Sally

Things are going well...My wife and I are expecting in early August.  Other 
than that I've been busy with my RAC Compliance duties.  I haven't started 
yet, but I am interested in exploring other career opportunities at Enron.  
Any ideas?

Hopefully, those guys would stand out in the Woodlands like a sore thumb and 
would choose to go elsewhere.  Would be nice to have them behind bars, 
however. Doesn't make George W.'s record on executions look like such a bad 
idea, does it?  

I left Houston on Sunday afternoon.  Any new news on those 7?  --Sally

For now, have her boxes delivered to the spot behind your desk.  I sent Wes a 
message and copied you on that.  I can't remember the name of the person who 
works for Wes that handles moves.   Lisa filled in for her while she was out 
on medical leave.  She is back.  Can you get with her right away and see what 
you can come up with?  Best situation would be for Beth to sit near me.  

Also, Bob Hall has someone who is coordinating space needs for us now that 
Lisa is gone.  Can you check with her, too?  

Also, Jeff Shankman called me last week to ask how we could speed up our 
(Energy Ops) move off of 30.  I don't know who is left on 30.  Can you get 
the person that reports to Bob Hall to give me an update on our moves from 30 
so that I can get back with Jeff this week?  Thanks. --Sally

Hi Patti,

This will probably be the first of many emails in the next couple of weeks.

Do you have a location as to where Beth will be sitting over there?  We'll be 
packing up her boxes soon to ship over and for future post etc.

Also, she will need a new extension number.  She would most definately prefer 
an 853 number and if you can use her VP status to help her get one if they 
refuse (her words) then that would be great.  Her old number was 853-5521 
although someone else may have that now.

Thank you for your help.  It is very much appreciated.

Janine

Per Catherine at Travel Agency in the Park, bulkhead seats were all that were

flights have gotten quite popular lately.  Only other option for return:

Same isle (E)
 - Row 8 (also bulkhead, but maybe not as noisy)
 - Last row window seat (doesn't recline as much as other seats)

If you like either of these better that existing seat, let me know & I change 
it.

CONGRATULATIONS !!!!!

Thanks for your nice note.  I certainly follow your career with interest.  

I have been meaning to call to tell you how much we enjoyed getting the 
wedding picture with your Christmas card.  What a great picture - you look 
beautiful and happy.  Meagan and Amanda particularly enjoyed seeing it.  My 
best laid plans for Christmas cards became a limited vision this year - only  
managed to get them in the mail to people outside of Houston.  Maybe next 
year...

I am in your old stomping grounds this week -- London.  I will see Mo 
tomorrow night for dinner and to catch up on her life.  

See you next week!  --Sally Thanks for your note on the promotion.  This was definitely a goal and is 
very rewarding to get there.  

I would love to talk with you about your second rotation.  In fact, I 
mentioned you to Jesus Melendrez just last week.  He works with John Thompson 
and Scott Josey in the upstream capital markets group (producer finance).  I 
filled him in on the Energy Management degree and told him that I thought 
that his group should talk with you about a possible rotation.  

I am in the London office this week.  Call Patti and ask her to schedule  a 
time for us to get together next week when I am back in the office to talk 
about rotations.   I will look forward to it. 

Definitely put January 31 on your calendar for a tour of Enron Field and 
dinner (someplace downtown with heat -- any suggestions?).  Patti is working 
on some of the details this week for us to host Ted Jacobs and about 14 of 
his students while they are in town for NAPE.  --Sally

Sally,

Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  It is always 
encouraging to see dedication and strong leadership recognized.
Your success here at Enron certainly provides a great example for individuals 
beginning their professional careers.  I certainly appreciate
the interest  and guidance you have provided in my career at Enron.

As you know, I am approaching the end of my rotation in Texas Risk.  As I 
began the search for my next rotation I would like to start by
leaning on your insight and advice.  I have gained valuable knowledge while 
serving in Texas Risk,  but I do not believe that trading is the direction
I want to take.  I know that your schedule is ever tight, but I would like to 
discuss potential rotations at your convenience.

Thanks,
Jody

Patti is beginning to work on details for the 1/31 tour of Enron Field and

of recent OU grads so that we can get the invitation list together.  I hope 
that you have that date on your calendar!   I will ask MIke McConnell if he 
would like to join us, too.  Michelle:  This is a stab at something to include in the newsletter.  Will

Operational Risk Management was the topic of an information session held last

supporting trading operations for EA, EIM and EGM in Houston, Portland and 
Calgary.  Operations professionals who manage risk book reporting and 
anaylsis, confirmations, physical product scheduling and cash management 
reaffirmed their roles in effectively accessing, managing and mitigating 
operational risk.  This focus on operational risk management  will ensure the

I am so sorry about the fire.  That must be awful -- but I am so glad that no 
one was hurt.  I had not heard about it until Mo called me today.  Please let 
me know if there is anything that I can do.  Do you need me to get you 
anything over here and ship it to London?  

I can certainly understand that you will reconsider the trip to Houston next 
week.  I know that you must have hundreds of details to handle.  

My plan right now is to be off the week of Thanksgiving.   My nanny will be 
on vacation that whole week so that she can make a trip out of town.  I may 
do some work early in the week, but likely from home.  The week after 
Thanksgiving I am supposed go to Wellesley College (Boston area) to interview 
for the analyst program.  I am due at a reception on Monday night (November 
27) and I will interview on Tuesday (November 28).  Assuming that I can get a 
flight back on Tuesday night, I will be in the office here in Houston 
Wednesday through Friday that week.  Would that work?  Sorry I am out so much

merits as well.  Please get back with me via e:mail and let me know our

like for us to be within the guidelines for merit increases.  Outside this

data gathered by Todd Burke.  We can process those agreed upon requests, but 
will not include those dollars within our merit totals.  That way, won't have 
to request additional dollars for these worksheets.  Better not to ask for 
exceptions on everything!!!

What is the word on bonus dollars?  Is everything finalized as I submitted?

What is the word on bonus dollars?  Is everything finalized as I submitted?  
Let me know.  If we need to talk directly, contact Patti for a number where 
you can reach me.  Thanks.  Thanks for your nice note.  I hope that you are having fun in your new role.  
We will have to schedule lunch so that I can catch up on what you are doing 
now.  --Sally

Sally: Just a short note to congratulate you on your well-deserved promotion. 
I always thought you had the toughest job in the Company; I guess everybody 
else finally caught on!

Jordan

Thanks for your nice note.  I am pleased for all of us at the increased 
recognition of the roles that we play within the organizaiton.  My ability to 
do my job well is very dependent on those of you who play key roles in 
operations.  Thanks for your part in that and for your continued support.

tremendous amount of respect for you and your contributions and values.

Subject: Clearing User Meetings

I have attached the e-mail that Ron Nolte sent to the Deal Clearing user 
community regarding the meeting
that is scheduled for November 16-17.   Please note that this is a meeting 
organized by the IT community, not
the user community.

As you may remember, Stephen Schwarz organized a similar meeting last fall in 
order to provide the IT group
with an agenda of what projects the user community considered to be priority 
projects.  However, the arrival of
EOL greatly altered the IT resources available to concentrate on those 
priority projects.  Today, the deal 
clearing community is struggling to get IT resources due to new systems such 
as ClickPaper.com, Commodity
Logic, project Thunderball  and a new weather capture and confirmation 
system.  This has created some internal 
conflict since each user group supported by the IT deal clearing applications 
group is requesting that their projects 
be set as the top priority project.  

This is a quick outline of the challenges facing both the deal clearing user 
community and the IT group supporting
this group.  I would be happy to discuss any questions you have about either 
the meeting or these challenges.

I don't think that the doorstep reviews are the right venue for this.  I 
believe that to address what seems to be David's concerns would be better 
handled with an appropriate person deemed to lead a special project in a 
directed timeframe with a well defined scope.  We purposefully utilize 
differing personal on the doorstep reviews and it would seem that concerns 
over proper valuation should be addresses in a timeframe that is not 
dependent on the schedule of doorstep reviews around the world.

Subject: Re: Doorstep and Risk Reviews  

Doorstep is a joint MRM RAC and Energy Ops review process.  If we want to 
include a full review of all the mtm methodologies we need to start building 
this into the doorsteps by ensuring that the RAC person attending the 
doorstep has the relevant experience to perform this review and that the time 
scheduled to do the review is adequate.

Subject: Doorstep and Risk Reviews


I am getting a strong sense that there are many holes, patches and 
workarounds in the upstream risk systems, relating to their ability to 
reflect accurately the valuation, and the risk attached to the products that 
get traded.

I would like to use the doorstep process and the risk review process to 
establish precisely what those holes are, if we don't already know. Here is 
an example:

 "All of our systems value options at-the-money, regardless of moneyness." 
True or False ?

Can you please include this concept in those exercises. The aim is, at least 
by the end of Q1 we can put our hands on a summary of everything.

Thanks
DP









Enjoy the trip.  Two of our most fun vacations were at South Seas Planatation 
on Captiva Island.  

Sorry that I didn't have time to respond to your e:mail from last week.  It 
will be great if you can use some of the baby stuff.  Yes, the bed and 
changing table match -- maple with a small amount of blue (not bright) trim 
on the bed and maple only on the changing table.  Our bedding could probably 
go either way, boy or girl.  If I remember correctly, the bumpers are red 
ticking trimmed in blue chambray and the dust skirt is red ticking with blue 
chambray and red bandana trim.  It's not as loud as it sounds - just take a 
look when you are here.  We also have a beautiful cradle (with bedding) for 
you to look at and a great baby swing.  As the baby gets older, we also have 
an entertainer - now takes the place of what we used to call walkers.  

I am mailing you a Martha Stewart magazine on babies (yes, she does those, 
too!), as well as several cataloges that we get that have cute nursery items 
in them.  

Yes, good news on Dad.  I hope that in the next few weeks that his medication 
will kick in and he will see some improvement.  It is highly likely that the 
infection could be a cause of many symptoms that he has had.  It is just 
great to have a good diagnosis and the proper treatment started.  I think 
that he dodged a bullet on this one.  

We will look forward to seeing you and Chris for Thanksgiving.  No big plans 
yet.  I assume that everyone will be here by at least Wednesday night.  I 
have ordered a birthday cake from RJ Goodies to help celebrate all November 
birthdays that evening.  Am hoping that Mom and Dad may come over on Tuesday 
so that we can do some fun things on Wednesday during the day (always a great 
day to shop while everyone else is home getting ready for Thanksgiving!).  I 
will have the whole week off from work.  The kids are off starting on 
Wednesday.  It is possible that on Friday, David, Amanda and Tyler may drive 
to Longview to have a visit with his mom and family.  If you can stay, we 
could really plan something fun if I an partially childless!!

Hello!   I'm off to the seashelling capital of the world . . .

Here's my travel itinerary should anyone need to reach me:

Going:
Wednesday, Nov. 8
Delta 1258 to Atlanta - leave 9:15 A.M.
Delta 1920 to Ft. Myers,  Florida
arrive florida 3:35 P.M.

Return:
Sunday, Nov. 12
Delta 1677 to Atlanta
Delta 4741 to Austin
arrive Austin 6:30 P.M.

Staying at Sanibel Harbour Resort & Spa in Ft. Myers, Fla
941-466-4000
I won't have my cell phone with me, so if you need to reach me, leave a
message for me.   My roommate, should they not be able to locate my name, is
Laura Suarez.   We're all with the loud and overly-extroverted USTA group.

Should you need to reach Chris, call his work no. at 477-8787 and they will
be able to tell you how he can be reached in Singapore.    Wanna call Erica?
She's having her last hurrah at the farm - so I wouldn't disturb her if you
know what's good for you.

Yes, just call Wanda and let her know that Rick has asked that we add EES 
Houston to the Doorstep review schedule.  In keeping with other reviews, I 
would not necessarily give Wanda the dates.  We should also send a short memo 
to Kevin and Marty to fill them in on the process and purpose of the 
reviews.  I should probably send that to them.  Can you remind me when I am 
back in town the week of January 22?  Thanks.

Dear Sally,

Would you like me to get together with Wanda and determine how to break this 
news?

Thanks

Absolutely.  We may need to let Kevin Hannon and Marty Sunde know this in 
advance.

Subject: Doorstep - EES

Dear Rick & Rick,

Encompassed in the Doorstep schedule given to you during our last meeting 
were scheduled reviews for London and Houston EES offices.  Do you consider 
EES and EBS to be groups that should be scoped into the Doorstep reviews?  
Since we have never addressed this specifically, I'd like to get your 
thoughts.

Thanks

Shona








I will be thinking about you and Brenda over the weekend and know that you 
will both be glad for her to return home.  I have mentioned to you before, 
Hector, that an Enron friend has dealt with a brain tumor successfully.  That 
is Barbara Gray, an attorney in ENA's Legal Department.  Barbara counsels 
patients and their families who are facing situations similar to hers.  If 
you feel like you would like to talk with someone who can understand on a 
more firsthand basis what you and Brenda are facing, I would encourage you to 
contact Barbara.  In addition to having been through her own battle with a 
brain tumor, she is simply a wonderful person whom I know you would enjoy 
meeting.  I have mentioned your situation to her, and she would certainly 
welcome a conversation with you.  

I will be in the London office next week, so we will have to coordinate on 
merit increases from there.  I will be back in the office on Monday, January 
22.  -Sally

Subject: Update

I saw Brenda last night and she was doing very well.   We expect that she 
will remain in NICU until approx. this afternoon and it is hoped that she 
will be able to come home on Monday.   As Frank has probably already told 
you, the Surgeon could only remove 50% of the tumor.   He believes it was 
benign and we'll have confirmation today.   
Brenda will need several MRI's and Gamma Knife therapy (radiation) 
treatments.   We don't know the particular demands of this therapy but, we do 
look forward to having it provide a long term solution.   
I anticipate at this point that I will need to work from home or stay in 
touch from home on Monday and that I will be able to return to your good 
company on Tuesday.    I remain available and in touch via my cell phone, 
pager and e-mail.   Please don't hesitate to call.    Working with you is a 
welcome distraction. 
Thank you very much for you support and prayers.   I look forward to seeing 
you soon.

It will be good to use your knowledge of the business in helping EIM to 
grow.  I hope that you enjoy your new rotation.  --Sally

Sally,
 I've decided to rotate within EIM from Trading to Origination.  Thanks for 
offering to help me.
Kim

I will be in London the week of January 15th.  I understand from Beth that 
you and Frank will be in Spain on Monday night.  Beth and I plan to have 
dinner that night.  Will you be back in town later in the week?  I have 
business plans for dinner on Tuesday and Thursday.  Could you make dinner on 
Wednesday night (the 17th)?  There is an Enron happy hour for Beth that I 
will stop by at 6:30 that night, but I expect to be free after that.  

I have a belated Christmas gift for you.  Hope we can get together!  --Sally 

PS  Am staying at 47 Park.  Please put details of this meeting on my calendar.  Thanks.

Subject: Exposures Meeting

Please put this on your calendars - I would like for both of you to attend.  
Should Jeff and Stacey be there, too?  This will be a meeting that we should 
have regularly with Wes and team so that can jointly review any exposures and 
make timely decisions on how to handle those.  I am sure that there is some 
prep work that needs to be done for this meeting.  I would assume that we 
should cover A/R, UA4, imbalances, weird or over/undervalued deals in risk 
books, OA, etc.  Can you work with Greg and Georgeanne ahead of time on 
content and have necessary back up to discuss highlights.  I would love for 
us take charge and lead this meeting.  --Sally

Congratulations on your promotion!  What a great statement to how far you 
have brought Energy Operations.   I'm sure your team will be excited to see 
your efforts recognized.  Also, it is very encouraging to see a female name 
on the list.  Best of luck! 

Tana Cashion

Mark Frevert has reviewed the attached addition to the upcoming 
organizational memo and has asked that I forward it to you to be included.  
This would be included in the section under Commercial Support, added as an 
additional bullet point beneath the one that addresses Business Analysis and 
Reporting (I believe that these bullet points are on Page 3 of the draft 
memo).  

Please call me at x35926 if you have any questions.  
I will call you tonight!

Yes, you are nuts!  I can't believe that you already have so many
gingerbread houses made.  The cookie exchange was fun - fudge is definitely
the easy route on that one.

I will get the recipe from home tonight and will e:mail it to you tomorrow.

Hey--how was your weekend--fudge delivered?

Got my bake sale item done--an 18 layer cookie tower.  Have 9 houses baked
with 3 to go.

Now to show that I really have gone nuts--I thought I would cook breakfast
for the 2nd grade at school on Friday morning....can I have your breakfast
pizza recipe?  We all thought it was great and I think the kids will think
it is fun....

Thanks!

Cindy
