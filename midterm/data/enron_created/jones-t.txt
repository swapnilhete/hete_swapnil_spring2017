note in to you, and when you feel better maybe we could have a little chat.

I miss you!We have received the following executed Master Agreement:

Subject: Updated EOL Customer profiles

Frank:

We have recently rethought our treatment of some of our Western 
counterparties.  Originally, if a Western CP traded power in the West under 
the WSPP Agreement, we permitted the CP to enter into Enron Sales only for 
Eastern power pursuant to the on-line GTCs.  However, we have decided that 
certain of such CPs should not be permitted to trade Eastern power at all.  
Accordingly, please revise the profile for the CPs listed below so that they 
cannot buy or sell Eastern power products via EOL:

Arizona Public Service Company
Avista Corporation - Washington Water Power Division
British Columbia Power Exchange Corporation
California Department of Water Resources
City of Redding
Colorado Springs Utilities
Idaho Power Company
Los Angeles Department of Water & Power
Nevada Power Company
Northern California Power Agency
Pacificorp
Public Service Company of Colorado
Public Service Company of New Mexico
Sacremento Municipal Utility District
Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District
San Diego Gas & Electric Company
Seattle City Light
Sierra Pacific Power Company
St. Joseph Light & Power Co.
Tucson Electric Power Company

If any of these CPs have previously traded any Eastern power products, please 
let me know at your earliest convenience so that I can address this issue.

Please note that this change should not affect the ability of these CPs to 
trade Western power products.

Thanks:

Leslie

Tana,

I will be out Monday morning for my home inspection.  Also, I have my Scenic 
Texas board meeting at 2:00 pm in Dallas on Friday, so depending when I can 
get  plane reservations, I will be out some or all of Friday.We have received the executed Acknowledgement and Termination Agreement dated 
effective as of December 1, 1999 by and among El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas 
Company (formerly known as El Paso Marketing Company, also formerly known as 
Eastex Hydrocarbons, Inc.), El Paso Merchant Energy Gas, L.P., El Paso Energy 
Corporation,  and ENA (formerly known as ECT).  Such document referenced the 
merger of Sonat Marketing Company, L.P. with and into El Paso Merchant 
Energy-Gas L.P., and the subsequent assignment of El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas 
LP's rights, duties and obligations to El Paso  Merchant Energy-Gas Company.

Under such agreement, the parties agree that:

1.  ENA and El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company agree that (a) the Sonat 
Marketing Company and Sonat Marketing Company, L.P. financial Transactions 
shall be governed by the El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company financial Master 
Agreement dated as of April 20, 1995; and (b) the Sonat physical transactions 
shall be governed by the El Paso Enfolie Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement 
dated March 1, 1998;
2. El Paso Energy Corporation, as Guarantor, agrees that its guaranty shall 
remain in full force and effect with respect to the transactions evidenced in 
Item 1 above;
3.  Enron Corp., as Guarantor, agrees that its guaranty shall remain in full 
force and effect with respect to the transactions evidenced in Item 1 above;
4.  ENA and El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company agree that the Sonat 
financial Master Agreement dated as of September 1, 1994, and the Sonat 
Master Firm Purchase/Sale physical Master Agreement, will be terminated;
5.  Each of ENA, El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P. and El Paso Energy 
Corporation agree that the Sonat physical Guaranty dated August 28, 1995,  
the Sonat financial Guaranty guaranty dated August 28, 1995, the Enron Corp. 
financial Guaranty dated as of August 28, 1995 and the Enron Physical 
Guaranty dated May 1, 1994 are thereby terminated.

All of the above is rather complex, and I've tried to reduce 3 pages of 
"Whereas" clauses into 1 paragraph, but I will distribute the document to the 
usual suspects, so any confusion about parties should become clearer.On the attached list please note that per my email of 04/17/00, U.S. Gas 
Transportation, Inc. has been acquired by Aquila.  Future trading for this 
counterparty should be done out of the name USGT/Aquila LP.
Any update yet?In connection with the execution of the new ISDA Master Agreements between 
ECT and ECT Canada and PG&E Energy Trading Gas Corporation and PG& E Energy 
Trading, Canada Corporation, we, and they, will be issuing  new "umbrella" 
guarantees that will cover all transactions between the above entities and 
also cover EPMI and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P. and CEG Energy Options 
Inc. (a PG&E affiliate)  These new guarantees will cover all physical, 
financial and power transactions between the above parties.  I have sent them 
the original of my Enron Corp. Guaranty for $105,000,000 and have received in 
the original of the PG&E Corporation Guaranty for $100,000,000.  Rod is 
resolving whether we agreed to increase the Enron Corp. guaranty to $110mm.

In connection with the issuance of the new bilateral guarantees I need to 
return to them the originals of the following PG&E guarantees:  (1) PG&E 
Corporation Guarantee dated as of March 28, 1998 covering business between 
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P., (2) PG&E 
Corporation Guarantee dated as of June 5, 1998 in favor of Enron Power 
Marketing, Inc. covering physical transactions, and (3) PG&E Energy Trading 
Corporation Guaranty dated March 11, 1997 covering physical business with ECT 
Canada.

I will also be returning to you the returned originals of the Enron Corp. 
Prior Guarantees.Jan, that was good, thanks for sharing it!Mark asked if you could work on the following with our new secondee, Jason.  
I provided Jason a hard copy yesterday since he didn't have a computer yet.  
Thanks!

I've been a little distracted.  I've had a contract on a new house, and we 
had the inspections yesterday and everything looks good, so we're just moving 
forward for a May 5 closing.  Also, I have had short in an electric line that 
keeps shutting off all the electricity to my apartment and they've finally 
isolated it and it is somewhere underground in my garden!  Dalzenia has been 
in there digging my garden up, and I think Louis has found the problem in the 
electric line so I hope they are going to get it fixed today so Dalzenia can 
replant my garden...it's always something.

Anyway, I don't have a barbecue, so I will have to borrow one.  How do I go 
about doing that?My closing is set for June 5, move-in date for my new house is June 9, so 
there should be no problem.We have a new lawyer that started in our group yesterday.  His name is Jason 
Peters.  Can you get him added to the Master Swap Agreement database ASAP.  
Thanks.

How goes moving the Portland masters?I am available Saturday after my morning run.  If you would like some help I 
would be happy to help out!Can we get some credit?  Much thanks!

Counterparty:  Kellogg Company

FYI

Per Sheila's inquiry and at Sara's direction, I called Ken Raisler at 
Cadwalader to determine if using the word "exchange" in a corporation's name 
would create any regulatory problems with the CFTC.

Per Ken, there has been some historical sensitivity about the use of the word 
"exchange" .  As we may have noticed though, a lot more companies are doing 
so without concern.  He said there was no regulatory problem with the CFTC in 
using "exchange" in your corporate name, however, putting "exchange" in a 
company's name may put you on the CFTC's radar and get you more scrutiny.

He also said that there may be regulatory conerns in Singapore and Hong Kong, 
so if we ever anticipate doing business there, it might not be a good idea.I guess you mean Wendi, no Molly?I forget when you are coming?  If you're in Houston on May 6, Jim Easter in

The way this came about, Sheila has a customer that was creating a new 
internal and, initially she contacted Sara and it was Sara's understanding 
that they were in the tranportation business, not trading, and wanted to use 
the word "exchange" in their company name, and did we, as the CFTC experts, 
know any reason why they shouldn't (I also understand it was Julia that 
mentioned to Sheila she might have an issue there).  After my email went out, 
Sheila came around with the press release they were drafting, and it sure 
sounded in the press release that this company's business was more toward the 
exchange and less toward the tranportation.  They used words like "online 
clearinghouse" and the like!  So I told Sheila maybe she'd better contact Ken 
Raisler directly since it seemed like she had a real problem there.  I 
haven't spoken to her to find out what came out of it.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 04/26/2000 04:44 PM

On the 4/25/00 list, Imperial Oil Resources Limited (cpy id 5193) was on the 
original approval list, but I had them as a U.S. counterparty instead of 
Canadian.  Credit now tells me they are Canadian, so I am a little concerned 
that I might have opened them for Credit Derivatives.  So if they are, shut 
them down since Canadian cpys can't do Credit Derivatives.  Of course, all 
counterparties should be shut down for Credit Derivatives now unless Credit 
tells us they are a Credit Derivatives cpy, and then I'll make a 
determination...but you know that...!

I am preparing an assignment of two physical gas trades that were incorrectly 
done online with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and ENA and assigning 
them to CIBC World Markets plc and ECC (ECC has a physical master with this 
counterparty, ENA doesn't).  I am adding a statement to the effect that these 
Transactions shall constitute "Transactions" under the ECC Master Agreement 
and want to confirm that "Transactions" is defined as such under your Master 
Agreement.  Can you confirm that for me.  Much thanks!

Too bad you won't be here for the party.  It's always a good one.  Also, 
Sunday is Astroworld day for Enron employees, but you probably won't get here 
early enough to do that either...

Hey, if you run into any problems, my home # is (713) 529-1038.  Don't be shy 
about calling me if you need any help with anything!  I mean it!All's I have to say is I was here this morning before 7:00 am, and I was the 
only person here until 8:00 am (if you catch my drift)...Why is an attorney doing secretarial work, much less paralegal work?  Also, 
she is primarily a litigator, and we have found that litigators don't know 
anything about contracts, securing collateral, corporate law, etc.

If we want a litigator, I understand that one of the old time 20 year 
Liddell, Sapp litigation paralegals has finally gotten to a place where she's 
ready to leave...Yes to both questions...I hope we are confirming trades under the new TXU ISDA Master...?!

I'm not Tim.  Perhaps you'd better contact him some other way.I am getting some pressure to get the database opened to the world.  The only 
thing left to do to get that done was to get the Portland masters migrated 
out.  What's happening with that?We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement between the 
referenced Counterparty and ENA dated April 27, 2000.  The copy will be 
forwarded to Dave Samuels.

It is my intention that Dave Samuels maintain a complete file of all the 
Confidentiality Agreements for EnronOnline.  If there is some otherr person 
than Dave who sould maintain the central file repository for EnronOnline 
Confidentiality Agreements please this let me know.Attached is our proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement for the referenced 
counterparty.




cc:  Carol St. Clair, Assistant General CounselThere is a document called "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS" in Marie's directory 
where we all input any CA we have sent.  For some reason since last week it 
has appeared as a "read only" document", so I cannot input the agreements I 
am working on right now.  Can you get that fixed.  Thanks!Can you email over to me the form of UK Industrial we worked out while I was 
over there.  Thanks!Attached is our form of Confidentiality Agreement which we would prefer to 
use.  If after reviewing our agreement you still prefer to use your own form, 
Carol St. Clair, an attorney in our group will have to get back to you with 
our comments.   I will wait to hear from you.

We will be celebrating the April Birthdays with an ice cream social on 
Monday, May 1st, at 3:00 p.m. in EB38C2.

I will send out a reminder on Monday.
Congratulations on the first bandwith trades!

I understand we have done two trades today with the following bandwidth 
counterparties:

1.  Broadwing Communication Services Inc. - we have a Master Bandwidth 
Purchase and Sale Agreement executed April 27, 2000, effective as of March 
28, 2000.  It has just arrived in the bandwidth Legal Dept. and Marie Heard, 
the paralegal for bandwidth, will be getting the copy down to Global 
Contracts.

2.  The other party appears to be El Paso Energy Communications, and we have 
no master in place with this counterparty, so an online confirm with the GTC 
should be used here.

If you have any other questions let me know, and I'll try and help you or get 
someone who can!You are the one!  I hope everything works out, keep me posted and let me know 
if there's anything I can do to help!Faxed the signed document to me at (713) 646-3490.  My direct phone in case 
you have any questions is (713) 853-3399.At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of

Attached is the form of Letter of Credit you requested.

Also, I am still working to get that info from London on the margin funds and 
securities.  They are working on it so I hope to get it to you soon.  They 
are the only holdout.
Just to give a head's up,

In case I'm not here and you have to get something signed for EnronOnline, 
Louise Kitchen absolutely does not want any other officer signing documents 
for her group.  The only two signatories for EnronOnline are Louise and Andy 
Zipper, Vice President.  FYI, we do have a resolution in place that allows 
certain individuals to sign password applications (only!) on behalf of 
EnronOnline.Let's chat about attached...!

I spoke to the guy reviewing the deals this morning.  He has come up with 
more deals than were on the list provided by Statoil/J. Aron, and now Bob 
Bowen is checking out the list.  They hope to have it to me by the end of the 
day.  It seems to me the way we need to proceed is to contact the J. Aron 
person and get the name of their person who can sign off on the trades, and 
have Bob Bowen and this person come to a consensus about the correct trades.  
Once we've got that nailed, then we amend their form of assignment to add the 
language that the trades need to go under the J. Aron master.  Are you with 
me on this?

Anthony Campos at 3-7911.

Attached is the form of Confidentiality Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 
853-3399 if I can be of further service.
As you both may recall, we left unresolved whether our intention was to have 
the credit derivatives tied to the applicable ISDA Master Agreement, if there 
was any.  Mark's first thought was that they would always go under a GTC, but 
after reflection, perhaps we might want them to go under the master.  We need 
to get this resolved because there is no global contract assigned to any of 
the credit derivatives online, which is causing much trouble between Global 
Contract and the online crew.

Can you direct me as to what our approach will be.  Thanks.We have received the executed Confidentiality agreement with Human Code, Inc. 
dated May 3, 2000.  Copies will be distributed to Dave Samuels and Bob Shults.
The only thing I use Kim for is to take up a hem.  She really isn't a great 
seamstress.  I also use that place on the corner of Greenbriar & Bissonnet, 
Alter Alley, if I need a jacket or a drass taken in, or sleeves shortened.  
Some people have told me they use that seamstress by the Hot Bagel shop and 
said they have done a really good job, but I have personally never used 
them.   I have an absolutely fabulous seamstress, she made my Barbie dress 
for Holly's prom, and has made bed coverings and table skirts for Lucinda and 
does a great job.  Her name is Ruth Erwin , she lives there right off 
Bellaire Blvd, close to the fwy and her # is 667-9731.   She is an absolute 
sweetheart.  I don't give her name out to a whole lot of people because I 
don't want to get her too busy or too expensive (I'm so selfish!).  Only to 
my select, special friends!----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 05/04/2000 07:54 AM -----

Nancy,

Below are the recipes for the party.  The only commitment I have so far is 
for the meat dish, so everything else is up for grabs.  Let me know which one 
you are making.

The directions to my house are as follows:

1.  Take 59 and exit Greenbriar like you are going to Church
2.  First light is Bissonnet, make a left on Bissonnet.
3.  Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile.  On the right you will see a gray 
apartment complex called "Maryland Manor".  The street right there is 
"Ashby", make a right on Ashby.
4.  The first left is Wroxton Court.  I am in the upstairs of the duplex at 
1714 Wroxton Court, but you probably will just want to walk around to the 
back yard.

My phone no. is case there are any problems is (713) 529-1038.  I look 
forward to seeing you there!

		 Subject: Church Gourmet Recipes (for May 13th Party)


Hi everyone:

I've attached the recipes for the May 13th Church Gourmet Dinner.  They are in
Word, but please let me know if you have problems with the attachments.  I can
convert them or fax them to you.  I have made notes on the recipes regarding
the advisability of doubling some of them for a party of more than 8 guests.

At the bottom of this email, you can still review Alicia's original
instructions and comments about the parties (and the guest lists as they stand
now).

My only thoughts about dividing up the recipes among your guests are:

1.  Remind everyone to bring a bottle of wine for the group.

2.  The dessert recipe should perhaps not be given to a single male as it
requires a springform pan (an item I'm guessing is not common to most bachelor
kitchens).

3.  The person(s) to bring the soup should also bring bread.

4.  Remind the people doing the main course to do a mixture of pork & chicken.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Penny

What do you think?Andrea,

The firm commitments I have so far are for the potatoes and pork chops.  That 
red pepper dip looks really good, I may make that.  Do you want to choose 
another one.  We're still waiting to hear back from some people, so I may 
have to adjust the amount depending on how things go.  Let me know your 
choice!

I got several responses last night and this morning by email, so I am 
attaching a revised list.
We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement dated as of 
March 31, 2000 assigning two physical Canadian gas trades (EOL Deal Nos 
137945 and 149472) from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce to CIBC World 
Markets plc.  Such trades will be governed by the Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement dated November 16, 1999 between CIBC World Markets plc and Enron 
Canada Corp.  Copies will be distributedI've got the dinner schedules for 7:30 pm.  Your choice was perfect.  There 
was no overlap in choices on what people wanted to cook.  I couldn't have 
planned it better!Here's an updated confirm on Saga.  Bernice is awaiting your approval.

Here it is.  Please review and forward to Carol.




I'll be leaving for New Orleans in about 30 minutes for our legal 
conference.  It was fun visiting with you too.  I miss you terribly.Attached are the recipes.  I sent you them all because they all looked so 
good.  Will you be talking to Steve?  I left him a voicemail about the 
dinner.  I have scheduled him for the garlic bread.  I guess I will just mail 
him the recipe.

 - Black Bean Dip.doc
 - RoastRdPepperDip.doc
 - Cheesy Herb and Garlic Bread.doc
 - ShrimpGazpacho.doc
 - PorkChopsMangoBasilSauce.doc
 - ScallopedPotatoes.doc
 - DeathbyChocolate.docAttached are the recipes for the Church Gourmet Dinner.  I've got you down 
tor the pork chops (Alicia says  to make it a mix of pork and chicken).  All 
the recipes looked really good, so I thought you might want to look at them 
anyway.

The directions to my house are as follows:

1.  Take 59 and exit Greenbriar like you are going to Church
2.  First light is Bissonnet, make a left on Bissonnet.
3.  Stay on Bissonnet for about 1/2 mile.  On the right you will see a gray 
apartment complex called "Maryland Manor".  The street right there is 
"Ashby", make a right on Ashby.
4.  The first left is Wroxton Court.  I am in the upstairs of the duplex at 
1714 Wroxton Court, but you probably will just want to walk around to the 
back yard.

My phone no. is case there are any problems is (713) 529-1038.  I look 
forward to seeing you there!

 - Cheesy Herb and Garlic Bread.doc
 - ShrimpGazpacho.doc

 - ScallopedPotatoes.doc
 - DeathbyChocolate.docI left a message for Judy Wells and will keep you posted.  Hopefully by the 
end of the weekend I should have an exact head count so I can tell people how 
much to make.  So far we've got 12.  The only recipe so far that is unclaimed 
is the Roasted Red Pepper Dip, you could either do that, or based on the 
number of people, you may do another of the meat recipe, since probably that 
will be the most expensive.  Why don't we chat (via email!) Monday and figure 
out the best way to go.

I've got a call into Peter Shaddock to see if I can borrow his barbecue grill 
and if he can get it to my house.

Another thing too, does the Church have folding tables and chairs to borrow?  
My table will only sit 6 at the best.I can go either way on this.  I have a nice backyard but no barbecue and not 
enough tables.  But it sounded like you might prefer not to host, and I don't 
mind, I just am not setup to do a big group.  I used to have a nice folding 
table but it was stolen out of my garage.  If you host it I would be happy to 
help out, bring nice flowers, do the dishes, make the pepper dip...!At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am transmitting a proposed form of Annex 
A for the referenced counterparty.  Please call me at x33399 or Sara at 
x35620 if we can be of further assistance.

There was a big computer virus spreading a few hours ago and we all had to 
totally shut down our computers.  Supposedly this virus was all over the 
world.  Maybe we'll hear about it on the news.

I have a meeting set up with IPI next week to demonstrate their system to our 
Global Contracts team leader, the Confirm Desk financial trading head, and 
also Mark Taylor.  Right now I'm working on a summary listing what I think 
our system issues are.  I've traded phone calls with Documentum.  I'm 
actually trying to get this summary done, so I can send it to them to show 
them what areas we may be looking for help in so they can focus their 
presentation on our specific needs.  I've looked at your material for Micro 
Modeling.  I will be contacting them next.

I've got our third paralegal trained, and she's getting up to speed, so I'm 
getting down to the last contracts I'm trying to resolve.  I have another big 
project that ends this coming Wednesday, Thursday I leave for Germany for 
vacation for two weeks, and I hope when I get back to devote my somewhat full 
time to this project finally.

So that's my story, how are you?----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 05/08/2000 03:51 PM -----

Agreement, please change the status in the master swap agreement database

"Executed" or "Executed-Under Amendment" should be the only two options you

a list of the disputed trades to resolve.  Once we are in agreement about the

the assigned trades (be they physical or financial) will go under the

The date our annual exemption expires in approval letter the NYMEX sends us 
when they approve our exemptions.  Because we have so many commodities we are 
applying for now, and the form is quite lengthy, it took the NYMEX quite a 
while last year to approve our requests, which moved the date back to July 26 
(last year our renewals were due the 1st week of July).  So we've got a lttle 
more time to work on it.  I will probably start notifying the various group's 
that provide information for the exemptions request sometime around the 
middle or toward the end of May.

There has been a change in plans, the dinner is now going to be held at 
Pastor Beth's.  A list of who is coming, what they are preparing and 
directions to Pastor Beth's house are attached.

Laura, is Steve getting the recipe from you or Pastor Beth?  Pastor Beth, 
I've got you coordinating with Matthias & Karen.

I've faxed the recipes to Karl & Ulf.  July Weller is the only one I need to

I have opened the referenced counterparty to trade weather online.  However, 
they should continue to use the same special form of confirm that they are 
using offline until we get an ISDA Master in place with them.We cannot move the trades until we agree to the assignment, which we have not 
done yet.  We are resolving the trades being assigned, so don't move the 
trades until you hear from me.  Bob Bowen has been working on this on the 
confirm desk side.Yes, we will be having it at Pastor Beth's.  Do you need directions?  It's at 
7:00 pm.

Attached is the Confidentiality Agreement you requested.

referenced counterparty.

Click on the following  link to add the 'Financial Trading Agreements' 
database to your Notes Workspace:

Link -->At the request of Louise Kitchen, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Confidentiality Agreement.  If you have any questions or comments concerning 
the agreement please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399 or Mark 
Taylor, Assisant General Counsel, at (713) 853-7459.  If the agreement meets 
with your approval, please have it executed by an authorized officer and 
return it to me via fax at (713) 646-3490.   
This Koch trade you sent me is a London based Credit counterparty, not a 
Houston counterparty so I have no information on it.  You are going to have 
to resolve this with London Legal, Edmund Cooper  who is an attorney in 
London at  011 44 20 7783 5382.  Attached is a list of Japanese counterparties.  I need to respond to 
EnronOnline Friday with my approvals to this list.  The list is broken up 
into 3 groups, Group 1 being counterparties already opened up for online 
trading (so you don't need to re-review), Group 2 being counterparties that 
we have correct names and credit on (you need to review this list which has 
about 100 counterparties), and Group 3 being counterparties that we have bad 
names or no approved credit yet ( so you don't need to approve this list).

You may ask, what products will these counterparties trade?  They can 
potentially trade all the products we offer online so you need to look at 
them like any new counterparty.  Saying that, what we really expect them to 
trade is the Singapore based group of products.

Attached are the referenced lists.

With respect to the list for 5/8/00, Imperial Oil Resources and Pengrowth 
Corporation were on the initial approval lists.  We have a duplicate Global 
Counterparty # open for Imperial.  The second one needs to be shut down.






Attached is the form of ETA Amendment we executed with Koch Energy Trading.  
The referenced Diamond Shamrock/Koch joint venture would like to execute the 
same one.  Is this OK with you.



Forever in your debt...TanaI didn't havw any time off.1.  Whenever we supersede and replace one Enron guaranty with another, we are 
supposed to have the "supersede and replace" language in the new guaranty.  
Is there some reason why it's not in there, and if we can't get it in at this 
late date, how are we going to make sure we don't have two live Enron 
guarantees out with the counterparty?

2.  Is there some reason one the state of Oregon is bolded in the guaranty?Attached for signature is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of the 
referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an 
ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need two executed copies since both parties 
have to execute the Guaranty.  This ISDA Master Agreement will supersede and 
replace an existing Master Agreement with this Counterparty, and this Enron 
Corp.Guaranty will supersede and replace the previous Enron Corp. Guaranty 
dated as of March 4, 1994.

 In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  Certificate of 
Incumbency.

 Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the 
documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

I left a message for Mike Neves this a.m. to see if we could get together 
this morning to check on things so we can open the database up.  Meanwhile, 
what the confirmation desk could do is forward me an email for them and 
anyone from settlement that may want access to this database.  I am going to 
have to email people the link to get in.Within the next few days (I hope!) we will be able to open the Master Swap 
Agreement Database, now called the Financial Trading Agreement Database, to 
people outside of Legal and Credit.  You will be able to use this database to 
verify master agreement information and special confirmation issues. 

Jeff, once we  have the data inputted, you will also be able to verify branch 
offices and adopted ISDA Definitions in the Master Agreement (that project is 
still in progress). 

Can you please send me a list of the people in your group who would like to 
have view access to this database.  I will have to email them the link.Melissa,

I still need to return the prior PG&E guarantees referenced below to the 
counterparty.  Were you having them pulled?

In connection with the execution of the new ISDA Master Agreements between 
ECT and ECT Canada and PG&E Energy Trading Gas Corporation and PG& E Energy 
Trading, Canada Corporation, we, and they, will be issuing  new "umbrella" 
guarantees that will cover all transactions between the above entities and 
also cover EPMI and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P. and CEG Energy Options 
Inc. (a PG&E affiliate)  These new guarantees will cover all physical, 
financial and power transactions between the above parties.  I have sent them 
the original of my Enron Corp. Guaranty for $105,000,000 and have received in 
the original of the PG&E Corporation Guaranty for $100,000,000.  Rod is 
resolving whether we agreed to increase the Enron Corp. guaranty to $110mm.

In connection with the issuance of the new bilateral guarantees I need to 
return to them the originals of the following PG&E guarantees:  (1) PG&E 
Corporation Guarantee dated as of March 28, 1998 covering business between 
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and PG&E Energy Trading - Power, L.P., (2) PG&E 
Corporation Guarantee dated as of June 5, 1998 in favor of Enron Power 
Marketing, Inc. covering physical transactions, and (3) PG&E Energy Trading 
Corporation Guaranty dated March 11, 1997 covering physical business with ECT 
Canada.

I will also be returning to you the returned originals of the Enron Corp. 
Prior Guarantees.

Theresa Smith forwarded your comments to the NDA to me.  I ran them by Mark 
Taylor, an attorney in our Legal Dept., and am attaching a clean and 
blacklined draft reflecting the changes we were able to make.

If your lawyer needs to talk to Mark directly his phone no. is (713) 
853-7459.  I am a paralegal in his group and if you would like to get in 
touch with me my phone no. is (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to hearing 
from you.




I understand either of you gentlemen can advise me on what legal issues, if 
any, we might have with trading the new Singapore online products with my US 
based counterparty list..?  Do we have any issues trading those products with 
counterparties incorporated in any specific country?Attached please find referenced list.  A few notes:

No physical power or credit derivatives for any of these Japanese 
counterparties.  Re:  Bandwidth, as a general principle, what I'm hearing 
from the bandwidth lawyers is (1) for Japanese counterparties they can only 
trade the U.S. segment (which is currently the only segment we have online), 
and (2) for right now, we have 1 Netherlands and 2 German counterparties on 
the list, and they are still checking to get the scoop on those countries, so 
for right now I am shutting them down for bandwidth.
We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced 
counterparty dated May 11, 2000.   A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of=
=20
the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under =
an=20
ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.

 In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  (i) Certificat=

Per our conversation, I am attaching a copy of the form of Enron Corp. 
Guaranteee which has been sent today to Enron Corp. for signature.  My direct 
phone no. in case you need to get hold of me is (713) 853-3399.
We have received the following two executed Confidentiality Agreements:

Just wanted to drop you a note before I leave for Germany tomorrow.  I'm 
looking forward to the cooler weather.  I got some good bargains on post 
winter sweaters this weekend because no one in Houston is even thinking about 
buying a sweater!  I spent more money on clothes than I ever have at one 
sitting!

My backyard is really looking good.  It's almost all planted, maybe 90% 
done.  I've planted a few new trees, a Japanese Red Maple, and a Saucer 
Magnolia (which has lovely little pink fragrant blossoms).  It will be a 
while before they look like trees, though.  Right now they kinda look like 
tall bushes.  I've planted a lot of tropical plants, I've got a ten ft. 
plumeria (which is what they make the Hawaiian leis out of) which has little 
little yellow fragrant blossoms, and an Australian fern tree, which is about 
7 ft. tall and looks kinda like a palm.  They're in pots, because I'll have 
to take them in during hard freezed.  I've planted lots of climbing pink, 
yellow and white roses and one mauve hybrid.  It will take a while before 
they fill out.  Also, two pink/purple crape myrtles, which should add a lot 
of color.  Those are those colorful small trees that bloom all over 
Houston.   I've planted a lot of stuff with scent, and stuff to attract birds 
and butterflies.  I hope the next time you come it will have filled out a 
bit.  Right now we've been having so much rain that they're drowning a bit.  
I need a little sun to make them bloom.  And then there's my St. Francis 
fountain.  He's just lovely!

Also, the central air is done.  No more noise from window units.  Now he's 
painting my bedrooms, the front one a real pale blue, and the back one a real 
pale pink.  I hope when I get back from Europe it will all be over and I can 
start cleaning up all the dust.  I'll have 3 days to recuperate because of 
the 4th of July holiday.

You and Sue were going to spruce up your garden a bit.  Have you been able to 
do anything?  I'm so glad I got to see your house.  Now when you talk about 
things I can picture what you're talking about.

Also, when I get back from Europe I'm going to get some cats again.  I'm 
looking forward to that.  I think I'm finally over mourning the demise of 
poor Willow.

Mark said he didn't have a lot of time to visit with you when he was there 
because you were in Teeside a lot of the time.  I'm sorry he didn't get a 
chance to see your car.  I was trying to describe it to him and I don't think 
I gave it justice.

It was good talking to you the other day!  I'll give you a call when I get 
back.No wonder you couldn't find it!  Keep looking, 'cause I guess when you can 
see it, the job will be open outside Enron.  Didn't you think the job sounded 
perfect!

At the request of Rahil Jafry, attached is our form of bilateral 
Confidentiality Agreement.   Please let me know if the attached meets with

Attached is the list referenced above, revised to approve Imperial Oil

derivatives).  The other Imperial Oil Resources Limited  from the original 
approvals (cpy ID5193), I would like shut down for all products until I am 
provided information as to how it differs from the other Imperial Oil 
Resources.  Whew...!!!
The check is in the mail...no really...!!!

Actually, I meant to give it to you at breakfast last weekend, but I have no

Every time I've come by your office this morning, you've been on the phone so 
I hate to bug you when I know you are swamped but are we going to be able to 
do any more of the ISDA stuff today?  I have a conference call at 3:30 this 
afternoon that will be 1-2 hours and then I am flying home tomorrow so will 
be leaving the office around noon tomorrow.
I spoke to Harry Musikas in NYMEX Compliance this afternoon and he gave me 
verbal approval of 500 contracts for COB spot month for the next year, 
pending final approval of Bernie Purta (big boss at NYMEX).  We won't get the 
letter for about a week to 2 weeks, but I wanted to let you know.  I spoke to 
Mike Swerzbin and told him the same thing.  I'll pass on the approval letter 
and my revised list as soon as we get his approval letter.Larry Gagliardi has been talking to Valero Marketing and Supply Company about 
doing some gas crack business, and it appears Valero  will not trade with us 
under the current form of Master Swap Agreement we have in place with them.  
They will only trade under their form of ISDA Master, a copy of which is 
attached below.  I spoke to their lawyer, Kim Bowers, who is very nice, and 
she asked us to make our comments to their form by email.   After talking to 
Tanya while you were out, it appears that we need to revisit their credit 
situation since the credit under our existing master swap is quite old.  We 
will try to work on reviewing the legal terms while we wait to get the credit.

Thanks for your call this morning.  I was in the middle of legging some gas
cracks and had to go.

Before we begin trading with you, we need to execute an ISDA.  I am
attaching a copy of our standard schedule.  We have this agreement in place
with all of the major dealers; and so, in general, we will not accept
substantial changes to the agreement, particularly with regard to credit
terms.

Again,  thanks for your call, and I look forward to dealing with you in the

EOL Team,

Please approve the above mentioned for online trading for financial oil and 
gas in the U.S. only.    

We have a Master Swap contract with these guys, and they are an ESP.  
However, their exposure is well above the contractual threshold ($6.5MM 
credit line versus $12MM exposure) and we are not collateralized for the 
amount of exposure above the credit line.  So, as a result, we want to 
approve them for online trading, but we actually do not want them to be able 
to complete any transactions.  The counterparty has requested approval, and 
Fred Lagrasta has asked that we approve them so they can get online and see 
the stacks.  Credit does not want them to complete trades, so we need to set 
a very low credit line for online trading so when the counterparty attempts 
to trade (if they attempt to trade), is turned down.

If this is not possible, please ket me know so I can get back with Fred and 
the counterparty.

Thanks,

JohnDone...

on the line, but I discussed it with Mark, and their forms and legal issues 
are so different from ours that I told Anthony that they need to contact 
London Legal if they would like a presentation.I have passed on the confirmation termination letter you sent me to Melba 
Lozano on the Confirmation Desk for handling.Sorry for my hold up on this list.  I had an issue with the division/dba 
approvals that I needed to resolve with Dave Forster and Mark Taylor.  We 
will be issuing a policy (as soon as I draft it) about how to deal with 
divisions/dba's in the future.  For this Koch counterparty:

Per my conversation with Stephanie, I am provisionally approving this 
counterparty only with understanding that the online trading account name 
gets amended to read as follows:

Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.

If the counterparty will not agree to this name change on its account let me 
know, I will talk to the Koch lawyer.  (FYI, this is the way we styled the 
ISDA Master Agreement, at the direction of the Koch lawyer.)
We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced 
Counterparty dated May 12, 2000.  Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels and 
Teresa Smith.----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 05/19/2000 05:31 PM -----

With respect to El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P., this counterparty was on 
yesterday's list as an amended counterparty, but it is actually a new 
counterparty.  It should be approved for all products but power.

We have received the executed ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross 
Border) effective as of 06/29/99.  Copies will be distributed.

IMPORTANT:  All confirmations for this counterparty must contain the 
following representation:

"Each party represents that it is in compliance with the terms, conditions 
and limitations set forth in the board resolutions or other guidelines that 
are applicable to such party's execution and performance of this 
Transaction."Per my conversation a minute ago with Leslie Hansen, El Paso Merchant Energy 
is OK to trade power, so I have amended the spreadsheet to reflect that 
change.


I understand that you are the Keyspan man!!

We are being asked to look at combined physical/financial guaranty for 
Keyspan with the guarantor being KeySpan Corporation d/b/a KeySpan Energy and 
the guaranteed parties being KeySpan Ravenswood Inc. and KeySpan Ravenswood 
Services.  I have never seen this counterparty as a financial entity before.  
We've got Keyspan Energy Management, Inc. as a counterparty we sent a draft 
master to about a year ago.  Will these Ravenswood entities trade financial 
with us?  Do we need to add Keyspan Energy Management to the guaranty if that 
is indeed the Keyspan entity we are trading with?

By the way, what kind of boondoggle trip is this you are on?  You Credit guys 
live high on the hog!  You must have a bigger budget than us!  ----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 05/23/2000 05:16 PM -----

		 Subject: Language for the Confirmation

Tana,

The language in the Schedule should reflect what is in our Form#3, whereby 
"Enron Re:" is the U.S. entity and "Swiss RE - EFR" is a Barbados entity.  
Also, the tax form requested should be a W-8.

In addition, the following language should be added to the confirmation:

United States Federal Income Tax Characterization and Reporting.  The parties 
recognize and intend that, for United States federal income tax purposes, any 
payment by the Counterparty of the Floating Amount will be treated as a 
payment pursuant to a guaranty by the Counterparty of the obligations of Bob 
West Treasure, LLC to make payments pursuant to Section ___ of the 
[underlying Financing Agreement between Bob West Treasure and Royal Bank of 
Canada.]  The parties agree that to the extent either of the parties is 
required to report any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit 
relating to the Transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, 
such party shall report such item consistent with the characterization set 
forth above and shall not take any position on any tax return or report 
relating to United States federal income taxes which is inconsistent with 
such characterization.  The parties recognize that the manner in which they 
have agreed to characterize the Transaction for United States federal income 
tax purposes may be inconsistent with the manner in which the Transaction is 
characterized for other tax purposes and for accounting, regulatory or other 
purposes.  The provisions of this Section are not intended to affect the 
manner in which the parties report the Transaction for such other purposes, 
or the interpretation of the provisions of the Confirmation and the rights 
and obligations of the Parties arising hereunder, for any purposes.

Lorraine, Mike is wrong.  I never got the fax of the executed NDA.  May he 
could call his contact at the company and get them to send it to me?!

Per instructions from Brant Reves in Credit dated 5/15/98 (a copy of which 
has just been provided to me by Global Contracts), please inactivate the 
Master Agreement [ERMS] with the referenced counterparty.  It appears Aurora 
Natural Gas Systems LLC is a dba for Aurora Natural Gas, LLC.  We have an 
ISDA Master Agreement dated 1/20/00 in place with Aurora Natural Gas, LLC and 
all financial business should be transacted under such ISDA Master.  Further, 
per Brant's instructions, all trades done with Aurora Natural Gas Systems, 
LLC should be moved to the correct legal entity, Aurora Natural Gas, LLC.I was just speaking to Edmund Cooper about various swap matters, and he 
wanted me to ask the group to not make changes to his entries (for ECT 
International) in the Master Swap Agreement Database.  Someone went into one 
of his and added a note that the Trade Option Exemption was deleted when it 
wasn't.  If you think something is in error or needs to be added, please 
consult with him.  ThanksAnthony, in reply to your voicemail that you can't find the guarantees, 
you've got to have them somewhere there.  Maybe they're with some old Margie 
Wright files.  But neither Legal nor Credit would keep the original 
guarantees, so they've got to be somewhere there.Edmund,

Below is the standard information we always have in every email when we get a 
master swap agreement executed.  With this email Global Counterparty can open 
the counterparty. We then immediately send the master swap agreement and 
other documentation down in the attached memo.    If we get the master in 
signed but we're waiting on critical additional documentation  (like the 
guaranty or perhaps a legal opinion on a governmental) we hold off on sending 
the email.  Sometimes the file may not be complete because we are waiting on 
incumbency certificates (which we do not consider critical in most 
circumstances) so we may send the email, send down whatever executed 
documentation we have, while we wait on the certificates.  We used to wait to 
send the executed documents down until we had the whole package completed, 
but they can't approve the counterparty without getting the master.  Does 
this make sense?...

I am now going to look for one with special instructions...

Below is my standard memo to Global Contract with any kind of executed 
documents I send down to them.  Also, a new procedral thing that is evolving 
here in Houston, we used to send Global Contracts the originally executed 
guarantees, but Credit is not the gatekeeper and recordkeeper of all 
guarantees so we will be sending the originals to them in the future (with a 
copy in the Global Contract file)

Melissa Murphy
Kim Theriot
Rhonda Denton

Thank you,
Melissa
It's about 1 1/2 hour drive outside of the City.  I think if you wanted to 
ride you would only be able to do it weekends.  Are you still interested?We are ready to open the old "Master Swap Agreement Database", now called the 
"Financial Trading Agreement Database" to people outside Legal and Credit.  
Can you provide me a list of the people in your group that would like access 
so I can email them the agent to open the database.  Much thanks!Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

Susan,

Can you let me know if we have a recent Assignment Agreement for the above 
referenced Counterparty?  We are recieving Confirmations with the 'Electric 
Utilities' crossed out of their name.   Leaving the name as PPL Corporation.  
These are EOL deals, therefore we cannot change this to match them unless we

know anything.

Thanks,

How about adding the drop down for bandwidth trading?I asked Credit to put the referenced counterparty on the re-approval list for 
financial because momentarily we hope to get the signed ISDA Master Agreement 
in from the Counterparty and if certain things don't happen when I open them 
up they will have a cow!!

1.  When I approve them to trade financial online we need to make sure they 
are coded for having the master swap agreement in place.  They are insistent 
that they do not see the GTC and that the confirms and procedures agreed to 
in the master apply.

2.  All US and Canadian financial transactions, whether online or offline, 
should roll up under the master.

As soon as we get the executed ISDA Master Agreement in I will send an email.

I thank you and I know Sara Shackleton thanks you...!!!I am still waiting for responses on the 5/30/00 list.  I hope to have it to 
you shortly.
Thanks, as usual!!

Tana:

I have no idea how I missed this one -- sorry

Trafigura AG and CPN Central Fuels -- not authorized to trade US power since 
restricted by credit

Today's list:  

None of the following are authorized since restricted by credit:

Midcoast Marketing, Inc.

Thanks!

I got back from vacation late Friday.  Our whole group got bumped from the 
flight in Paris so they paid us $700 each to take the next flight out.  Not a 
bad deal!  But it was 27 hours travel time from start to finish and I was 
exhausted.  Luckily, it was a 3 day weekend here, so I had time to recover 
(and clean from my construction work).

I had a really nice time.  Most of our time we spent in East Germany, except 
for the flight out of Munich.  We went to Berlin, Leipzig, Eisenach, 
Wittenberg, Erfurt, Potsdam, and hiked in the Harz mountains.  My favorite 
time was the time spent in Kitzbuhl, Austria.  It was wonderful, I hope to 
make an annual hiking trip there for a week every year.  It is so hard to do 
anything like it in Houston, I forget how nice the mountains can be.  Our 
hotel was great, smack in the middle of town and it only cost $30, breakfast 
and dinner included!  Such a deal!  

I got home and my house is almost done.  There are only a few minor things 
left.  The garden is at 85%.  My landscaper had a big fight with my tenant 
while I was gone so she wouldn't come to my house until I got back.

I've picked out my two new kitties, and I'll pick them up this weekend, I 
think (if the painter is done).  They are calico cats.  I haven't named them 
yet.

What's going on with you?  Are they working you to death?  Any fun things 
going on?  
FYI, we are now executing Services Agreements, and it is my undertanding that 
Dave Samuels will maintain the files of the originally executed copies until 
I am given further instruction.  As with all the online documents I am 
getting executed on your behalf, I will maintain a copy in our files also.

We have received the executed Information Services Agreement dated May 22, 
2000 between Energy Argus Incorporated and Enron NetWorks LLC.  The original 
is being sent to Dave.
We have received the executed copy of the Confidentiality Agreement dated 
5/24/00 with the referenced party.  Copies will be sent to Dave Samuels and 
Mike Danielson.----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 06/02/2000 05:58 PM -----

We have a new paralegal in our group, Samantha Boyd, she just started 
Monday.  Can you get her Master Swap Agreement access.  Thanks!I am going to have to leave the Group Meeting a little early tomorrow.  The 
online team has scheduled a new employee training for tomorrow and at 10:30 
am Tom Moran and I are going to give a presentation on online approval 
procedures.Please note the following on the 6/5/00 list:

We are shutting down Aquila Risk Management Corporation for all financial 
trading effective today.  All financial trading should be done out of 
Utilicorp United Inc.  This counterparty was on the original approval list, 
and I previously had them shut down for financial trading.  Credit will put 
them on tonight's list, meanwhile, we need to open them up to trade all 
financial immediately.




I have created a new subdirectory in the attorney forms bank and moved the 
approved swap forms there.  The subdirectory is called "Swaps" and there are 
two sub-subdirectories under there called "Current Forms" and "Old Forms".  I 
hope this makes it easier to find the swap forms.

Also, by popular acclaim, we are doing away with the old numerical naming 
system for forms like 2101a, 2101b, and giving them  names like 
isda-multicurrency, isda-local currency, industrial-u.s. (was 2103.doc), 
industrial-canadian, etc..  I hope this also makes it easier to find forms.

I am also moving forms we frequently use  located mainly in my directory, but 
also in other people's directories, into the atty.fms bank.  If there is a 
form you would like me to move in that I haven't, please let me know.  This 
should make the forms available to users outside the Houston office. 

To the U.K. and Singapore:  We are going through a form revision process here 
in Houston and when we are done I will send you clean and blacklined copies 
of the changes to you for your review. I know you are busy, but you need to send out your email about the signed 
master as soon as possible, so we can open up Utilicorp to trade financial.  
Brant can only open them up from Credit's perspective, I have to open them up 
from Legal, but they will still not be able to trade only until Global 
Contract ties the counterparty to the master, and they cannot do that until 
they get your email.  Thanks.----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 06/06/2000 05:08 PM -----

I reviewed the counterparties in our Financial Trading Database and located 
17 who cannot enter into financial power transactions and cross-checked that 
list against my Online Trading Counterparty List and located the 6 
counterparties below have been opened to trade online and who cannot trade 
financial power and/or who have some type of restriction in place on the type 
of financial power transactions they can enter into:

1.  The Bakersfield Californian - can only do newsprint swaps and options
2.  CMS Marketing, Services and Trading - can enter into financial power 
transactions only if those transactions are fixed price swaps, basis swaps, 
swing swaps and options
3.  Phibro, Inc. - can only do natural gas, crude oil or oil product energy 
prices swap, put & call options.  Per my discussions with Tom, this 
counterparty is coming through on tonight's list as an amended counterparty 
because they want to do financial power.  They have a really old form of 
agreement in place from 1993 and it does not allow power financial 
transactions.  I spoke to Mark Taylor about this and he said if they want to 
do financial power they are going to have to replace this agreement with an 
ISDA.  I am going to talk to Credit about this.  They will definitely not be 
able to trade financial power by Monday...
4.  PXRE Corporation - weather only
5.  Swiss Re Financial Products Corporation - weather only
6.  Tempest Reinsurance Company Limited - weather only
In my absence on Monday and Tuesday, can you forward the counterparty 
approval lists to Samantha Boyd, a new paralegal in our Group, and she will 
forward them on to my distribution, so we can at least get people reviewing 
the lists while I am out.  Much thanks!----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 06/09/2000 09:15 AM -----

Leslie
On the list for 6/6/00, NRG Energy Inc. was previously not approved for 
physical power trading and we are not opening them up at this time.  Per my 
discussions with Credit, they are coming thru as an amendment to open them up 
for US power and emissions.  This counterparty is not showing up on the FERC 
approved marketers list, and Leslie Hansen is contacting the counterparty to 
determine what records they have, if any, that show they have been approved 
by the FERC to trade power.  Until we are provided that info, we cannot open 
them up for power.  US emissions has been opened. 





P.S.  If Utilicorp. need to be approved when I am out Monday and Tuesday, 
talk to Carol St. Clair, the attorney working on the ISDA Master, or Susan 
Bailey, the paralegal  working on the contract.Attached is the referenced Annex B.  Call me if I can be of further help.

Dan,

I just wanted to let you know how to proceed on getting the agreement signed, 
since I will be out Monday and Tuesday.

Samantha Boyd is a new paralegal in our Group and she will coordinate getting 
it signed.  Her phone no. is 853-9188.  I understand you need it signed by 
Monday since you are meeting with Continental Tuesday.

As we discussed, we are incorporating EnronOnline LLC today.  As soon as we 
hear from Deb Korkmas (a paralegal that handles our corporate matters) that 
the company has been incorporated you can tell Continental that they can sign 
the agreement and return it to us via fax (have them fax it to Samantha's 
attention at fax:  (713) 646-3490).  Upon receipt of the fax Samantha will 
get it initialled by Mark Taylor and have it walked to either Louise Kitchen 
or Andy Zipper for signature (depending on who is in).  Either of them can 
sign for all 3 companies, Louise as Managing Director, Andy as Vice 
President.  After the agreement is fully executed Samantha will fax it to 
Rick Wagner at Continental (unless you give her instructions to the contrary).

If the counterparty wants to negotiate the agreement, they will have to talk 
to Mark directly.  His phone no. is 853-3399.
You'll have to take that personally with Ms. Heard.  For you, it would have 
much more personal impact than "Most Favored Nation" status.  I would 
certainly want to stay on Marie good side.  Though I know it is tough to 
compete with sweet Russell...

		 Subject: D'Aarcy, Masius, Benton & Bowles USA, Inc. - Project Services 
Agreement


	


 You forwarded to me a letter from Enron Corp. to the above vendor 
authorizing the use of a subcontractor by the name of Jason Yang.

The letter is non-specific as to name and title but since the work is for the 
Online Project, I would imagine that Philippe Bibi would be the appropriate 
person.  

I have not submitted the letter to Philippe for signature for two reasons:  

(1) We do not have the original Agreement for Project Services.  I don't know 
who executed it but it is not in our files. 
(2) There are actually a couple of standard subcontractor agreements that we 
ask the Contractor and Sub-Contractor to execute.  I am attaching electronic 
copies to this e-mail and printed copies to the hard copy which I am 
returning to you along with the original letter.  

If we find the person (Corporate Officer) who signed the original Agreement 
for Project Services, we should have that person sign all of these documents 
and then formally transmit them to the vendor.  We need the original 
agreement before we can proceed.

Please call me if I can be of help.     

The subcontractor agreements are attached below.  gene 

  Per our discussion when I was in London, we ordered you  a box of blue files 
and sent them to you (for your original deal files since you said you 
couldn't get those types of files in England).  One of our assistants got a 
call from what I guess must be Meagan and she (Meagan) said she was sending 
the files back because it wasn't what she wanted.  So if you do want the blue 
files you might want to intervene with Meagan before the files cross the 
Atlantic again.  We would, of course, be able to use the files here, so no 
big deal.I don't know what a terminations number is?!

Can you tell me if any of the more recent ETA amendment letters that we have 
sent out for execution refer to the new termination number?  My recollection 
is that maybe only 1 or 2 did.

It looks like we may have to change the Houston terminations phone number. 
Can you tell me how many customers will be affected?

I will forward a new number once known (probably later this week). Will Tana

Thanks for the nice note, I am the person that has the really neat yard that 
was featured in the Chronicle, at least until this weekend when I bought and 
moved into my new house.  I have a lot of work ahead of me yard wise.  This 
yard has "great bones" but has been neglected for a long time.  Hopefully, 
some day it will look as nice as the yard at my old house!Here's the excuse we need to get me up there for the Stampede!  Isn't it

Thanks Kate, as usual, for your help with this!We got a call from the NYMEX today, and they received another Access terminal

five terminals that I ordered.  You do have your two in Portland, don't you?

Please confirm that for me.  Thanks!We have received the executed Second Amendment to Guaranty Agreement dated as 
of June 9, 2000.  This amendment changed the guaranty of Formosa Plastics 
Corporation, USA ("Guarantor") with respect to the physical transactions with 
Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. and financial transactions with Neumin 
Production Co. to an unlimited guaranty.  The original guaranty amendment 
will be sent to Credit.Per my conv. a minute ago with Maryann Friel, they will be fedexing the

Can you let me know if we have a recent Assignment Agreement for the above 
referenced Counterparty?  We are recieving Confirmations with the 'Electric 
Utilities' crossed out of their name.   Leaving the name as PPL Corporation.  
These are EOL deals, therefore we cannot change this to match them unless we 
have done some Assignment Agreement that we haven't seen.  Let me know if you 
know anything.

Thanks,

We have finally received the executed Termination Agreement for the two Koch 
physical trades done in error on EOL (which have already rolled off the 
books!).  The deal nos. are EOL Nos. 103992 and 104018.  I am sending the 
original to Bob Bowen.We have received the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreement wherein 
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce assigned two physical trades to CIBC World 
Markets Plc.  Those two deal Nos are EOL deal no 137945 and 149472.  The 
originals will be sent to Bob Bowen.To prepare an NDA for you I will need the following information:

1.  The correct legal name of the counterparty
2.  Whether the agreement is bilateral (both parties providing confidential 
information) or one-way (where only Enron is providing confidential 
information).  Our preference is to use the Enron protected party form since 
it is written more in our favor.
3.  The nature and/or use of the information being provided.
4.  The address of the counterparty
5.  The phone and fax number of the counterparty

Once I have all this I can prepare your NDA in short order.

Yeah, we also need to provide copies of the signed resolutions to Ted Murphy, 
so he knows what's approved, so he then knows who does a trade outside of the 
approval.

We also then need to update the index to our corporate resolutions binders 
and substitute the revised resolution in our binders so the binders always 
contain the most current resolution.see lotus notes problems

Carol,

1. We have set up the Master User from Aquila Risk under Utilicorp.  We do 
not require any further paperwork from them, however, we do need them to set 
up their sub-users.  I am going to follow up with Angela Webber at Utilicorp 
tomorrow to make sure that sub users are set up.

2. I will notify you once sub-user accounts have been set up and then wait 
for your instructions as to when we will shut Aquila Risk down for trading.

Thanks,
Stephanie x33465

Subject: Utilicorp

Stephanie and Frank:
Both Susan Bailey and I have spoken with Utilicorp's attorney and here is my 
understanding of where things stand:

1. On Friday, it was my understanding that they submitted their password 
application and that the problem was that the person that they needed to set 
up the sub-user passwords was not in the office.  My understanding is that he 
will be in on Tuesday and that is when they are going to try to set up those 
accounts.  Does that require them to send any paperwork to us?

2. Once the sub-user accounts are set up, then we need to pick a date for the 
Transfer Agreement to become effective.  Since we are changing the date from 
June 16th, this will require someone from Utilicorp to initial the change and 
their attorney wasn't sure when that will happen.  Once the new date is 
picked and initialed, then we can begin trading under Utilicorp's name, but 
nothing should be done until before then.  Either Susan or I will let you 
know when that date is.

Please call me at 33989 if you have any questions.
Carol

If we are going to vote on the NYMEX demutualization plan the ballots are due 
tomorrow, so today is your last possible day to get them out, since it only

It was good talking to you, as always.  I hope you got out and "stomped" a

in the cities, and or countries where we have trading offices, which is 
pretty much the list I had below.

I just got off the phone with someone at PP&L and I am trying to coordinate 
our response to assigning our physical gas, physical power, financial and 
online transactions.  Per my discussion with PP&L, Shari is working on the 
physical power assignments, Stacy has received the gas assignments, which in 
it includes an assignment of the online account, and the woman at PP&L is 
faxing me an assignment of their financial positions with us.  PP&L tells me 
that we have recevied Credit approval of these assignments, although I have 
not received such approval.

With respect to assigning their online account, I don't know if Frank has any 
particular issues, my only issue is that we don't only assign an account, in 
doing so we assign all trades under that account, and if the only trades done 
with PP&L are physical gas, power & financial, then we should be alright (if 
Frank is ok, in consenting to the assignment of the online account).  It 
seems to be a problem with her in opening a new account.

Saying, all that, I guess I need to know if (1) Credit has approved all these 
consents, (2) when power & gas have consented, and (3) if Frank is OK with 
assigning the online account over...Wouldn't you like to know which of the two Susan's gave her notice today!?!----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 06/19/2000 05:10 PM -----

I called Haedicke to check on the status of his Rappaport conversation, and 
he told me he hadn't had a chance to talk to him yet but to go ahead and fax 
in the ballots, which I have done (I got Kevin's too). I had to order a set of the ISDA Japanese documents for John Viverito, who 
will be leaving for Japan soon, so if anyone needs a copy I have them.  Also, 
London sent me a copy of the Amsterdam Power Exchange Rules, which I don't 
think anyone will need, but if you do, I have those too.Do you only want the form of Credit Support Annex and Paragraph 13 thereto, 
or do you also want a pro forma Canadian ISDA Schedule.  Also, I would expect 
that since you are dealing with Canadian municipalities you would want a form 
that include the special municipal provisions, which are somewhat lengthy?

		 Subject: Canadian Precedent Form of ISDA

Tana, Enron Canada is currently negotiating a transaction with 6 major 
municipalities in Ontario (the "G6") to provide various services to a company 
those 6 entities are setting up, which services will include physical and 
financial trading (both gas and electricity).  John Suttle is working with 
Jan Wilson of our Toronto office to set the credit terms applicable to this 
entity on both the physical and financial trading side, but they have not yet 
made a final determination.  In the interim, the G6 has requested that we 
send them a copy of our precedent form of master financial trading agreement 
(both the ISDA and our short form financial GTC).  I assume you get requests 
like this all the time and was hoping that you could e-mail to me (i) the 
ISDA, credit support annex, Paragraph 13, etc. that we would typically put in 
place between ECC and a Canadian counterparty to financially trade gas and 
electricity in Canada (ie. incorporating the Canadian provisions), leaving 
the credit terms blank for the time being and (ii) the financial GTC we use 
for Canadian counterparties.

Call me if you have any questions or if there are any problems with preparing 
and forwarding these documents to the counterparty.

Thanks

Attached are the referenced lists.  On the 6/19/00 list for Sithe Power 
Marketing, LP, they were on the original approval list, and since they are 
coming through again for SO2, and since I'm not sure if we had SO2 on the 
original list, I open them up for it just in case.  Also, I opened them up 
for financial, since it appears they have now met the eligible swap 
participant requirements, even tho' Credit is still not opening them up for 
financial.



,Done.Please direct this email to all employees at the offices indicated below (I 
think Sydney is our Australia office).  I have revised the letter a little 
and am reattaching  it.  Thanks!

Tana:  Jason still does not have access to the Financial Trading dababase.  
Can you facilitate please?  thanks.  SaraI would like to send the email out announcing this master and have a few 
questions.  First, about the approved products, as best as I can determine, 
we don't have the pulp & paper language in, and don't have the weather rep 
in.  Seeing as tho' they probably won't trade pulp & paper, I won't worry 
about that.  However, with respect to weather, since the weather rep is 
always added into the confirm, I don't think not having it in the master 
would necessarily mean they can't trade weather.  Unless you know of a reason 
to the contrary, I would think we want to open them for weather.

Second, looking at the agreement to see if there is anything else we want to 
mention to the general distribution group, I don't see anything in particular 
out of the ordinary with respect to trading issues, except in the Netting of 
Payments section which appears to allow payment netting amongst PG&E and it 
Core Procurement Department and California Gas Transmission Department.  Will 
they be financially trading separately under those departments?  And if so 
should we instruct the Settlements group to net the payments?

Anything else special you think I need to mention?We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement between Continental 
Airlines, Inc. and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Works LLC and 
EnronOnline LLC dated June 19, 2000.  A copy will be distributed to Daniel 
Diamond and Dave Samuels.Just a followup note:

We are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original 
incoming and outgoing guarantees to Global Contracts (which is what we have 
been doing for about 4 years, since the Corp. Secretary kicked us out of 
using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents).  I 
think it would be  good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to 
the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them.  So my 
question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts, 
to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us!).FYI,

I spoke to my contact in the NYMEX Marketing Group and she told me that the 
NYMEX demutualization vote passed 140-11.The draft of the email you sent Mark looks OK in terms of its content.  Is 
there any way I will be able to get some form of a confirmation reflecting 
that it was sent to all the offices in my prior emails?Per the email below, please note that if you haven't been sending your 
original guarantees to Credit, it appears this should be done so in the 
future.  Please forward this email on to other members of your group that 
might be responsible for filing original guarantees.

I need to send out the attached memo ASAP to all employees of Enron North 
America and its trading affiliate offices.  This includes Houston, Calgary, 
London, Denver, New York, Oslo, Singapore, Portland, Australia, Buenos Aires, 
and any other offices where we might have trading affiliates.  Can someone 
with your team get back to me ASAP so we can be clear about who we send this 
to.  Thanks!















Thanks, that was indeed what I was asking!

Since you like the list, I have another question (of course).  Was your 
question about confirmation asking how you can tell which groups the message 
went to?  If so, they will show in the TO field when you get the message.

Tana,

These are the groups that we have available for the cities that you mentioned:

 All Enron Houston
 Everyone_in_ECT_Calgary
 Everyone_in_ECT_London
 Everyone_in_ECT_Portland
 Everyone_in_ECT_New York
 Everyone_in_ECT_Denver
 Everyone_in_ECT_Oslo
 Everyone_in_ECT_Singapore
 Singapore EI Announcements
 EI-Australia
 Buenos Aires Argentina - Office Staff
 Buenos Aires Argentina - TGS Office Staff
 Enron Everyone_EOG_Denver
 Enron Everyone_EOG_Calgary

If this will do, let me know and I'll use these groups.  If you need 
something else , please contact Linda Lannom in HR to provide you with a list 
of all Enron employees by city.  Again, if you do this I will need them in an 
Excel spreadsheet with First Name, Last name, Social Security number and 
department.

I will send you a draft of the letter in a few minutes.  I will need you to 
send approval to Enron Messaging Administration in order to send it out.

Thanks 

Erika

It is the "and any other offices where we might have trading affiliates" 
portion of your message that still has me concerned.  I can send the message 
to all ENA and, if we don't have one already, have HR provide a list of 
employees in the other cities you listed.  However, I don't know the answer 
to the any other offices.  Do you want to send it to every employee 
worldwide?  

Sorry to be difficult but I still don't have a good idea of your desired 
audience.

Tana,

We have a recent group with all of ENA.  However, we do not have anything set 
up for trading affiliate offices or a way to determine that information.  
Please provide any names/addresses that are needed other than the ENA.

If you do give me names that are not already in a Notes address format, I 
will need you to provide them in an Excel spreadsheet with First Name, Last 
name, Social Security number and department to help resolve conflicts.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Just a followup note:

We are still unclear as to whether we should continue to send original 
incoming and outgoing guarantees to Global Contracts (which is what we have 
been doing for about 4 years, since the Corp. Secretary kicked us out of 
using their vault on 48 for originals because we had too many documents).  I 
think it would be  good practice if Legal and Credit sent the originals to 
the same place, so we will be able to find them when we want them.  So my 
question to y'all is, do you think we should send them to Global Contracts, 
to you, or directly the the 48th floor vault (if they let us!).







Just a reminder that I hope to be out this afternoon (as of this morning my 
old house closing is set for 3:00 pm, keep your fingers crossed it goes

customary it is to negotiate this with the OMLX?  Anyway, we'll take a look

Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tana Jones/HOU/ECT@ECT
		 cc: 
		 Subject: Employee Trading

Given the proliferation of new products and the potential of Enron Net Works 
to continue this trend, I am soliciting guidance as to the proper 
administration of the Risk Management Policy regarding employee trading.  

The following is the verbatim language from the Policy:

"Section VII.  Miscellaneous 
   Employee Trading.  No employee may engage in the trading of any Position 
for the benefit of any party other than an Enron Company (whether for theri 
own account of thr the account of any third party) where such Position 
relates to (i) any financial instrument, security, financial asset or 
liability whch falls within  such employee's responsibility at an Enron 
Compay or (ii) any other commodity included in any Commodity Group."

Administration of this policy has been limited to the efforts of Mark Taylor 
and Tana Jones in the Legal Department primarily consisting of employees 
"confessing" to trading certain products.    In the past, if the product has 
been one that Enron does not trade, the employee is told that it is ok.  If 
it is a product that we do trade, then they are informed to comply with 
policy.    Restrictions on the trading of financial instruments, such as 
equities, interest rates and foriegn exchange have been limited to those that 
are currently managing those books for an Enron Company or those who might 
have access to information that was not in the public domain.

Generally, we have found that people have traded yen, S&P futures, metals and 
agricultural products.   Now that we have authorized the trading of a wide 
variety of agricultural products and metals, we may need to advise employees 
not to trade them (immediately, soon, never???).   We may also consider 
changing the policy or altering our enforcement methods.

Please advise your guidance as to how to proceed.

Ted

Tana,

I am currently working on an audit of the Risk Controls Group sanctioned by 
Enron North America.
As a part of this audit, one of my objectives is to become more familiar with 
the NYMEX Limits
set for traders.  Specifically I want to:
 1.   Ensure that the limits are correct
 2.  See appropriate action was taken to satisfy the request of the Trader
  (ie.  If a request was made today to raise the limits, approval from the 
NYMEX 
  should be obtained.
and 3. I'd like to see all the documentation taking place between 
trader-Legal-Nymex.
  -- Does legal call NYMEX, or e-mail them? Please indicate the specific 
documentation involved.

I realize that this is a bit vague, but I just wanted to give a heads up on 
what my basic objectives were.
I was hoping that you could point me in the right direction, or perhaps let 
me know someone in your group
from whom I can get further information.

I certainly appreciate all of your help.
If you have any questions I can be reached at x31684.

Marie,

I think you are mistaken.  I was watching E, the Entertainment Channel, last 
night, and Joan Rivers was doing her best and worsed dressed review at 
Cannes.  I noticed this incredibly handsome and debonair man, dressed all in 
black from head to toe, a shy smile, with eyes hidden behind dark glasses, 
and a lovely beauty on each of his arms.  I thought, "could it be...might it 
be...?!".  And it was...it was truly he.  I'm sure of it!With respect to Utilicorp, I cannot amend their profile yet to open them for 
financial until I get the word that everything is set up and ready to go.  We 
do have the financial master in, so as soon as we figure out how we want to 
open the accounts, I can send my email.
Let me know on MRT what you find out.  When can I see your house?

I am still getting the chill and it's getting really old.  I've tried to

Below is slightly revised language to be included in the ISDA agreement being

transaction documentation to review in connection with this clause, I have 
bracketed several portions of the clause to be filled in as dictated by such 
documentation.  Please call with any follow up.  Steve.

Subject: Language for the Confirmation

Tana,

The language in the Schedule should reflect what is in our Form#3, whereby 
"Enron Re:" is the U.S. entity and "Swiss RE - EFR" is a Barbados entity.  
Also, the tax form requested should be a W-8.

In addition, the following language should be added to the confirmation:

United States Federal Income Tax Characterization and Reporting.  The parties 
recognize and intend that, for United States federal income tax purposes, any 
payment by [Enron Re] of the [Floating - this assumes that Enron Re is paying 
such amount] Amount will be treated as a payment pursuant to a guaranty by 
[Enron Re][of the obligations of Bob West Treasure, LLC to make payments 
pursuant to Section ___ of the [underlying Financing Agreement between Bob 
West Treasure and Royal Bank of Canada - this needs to be clarifed - is the 
payment related to the RBC loan or the insurance payment by EFR?  If it is 
the RBC loan then this clause is appropriate but if, alternatively, it is the 
EFR insurance payment, then the reference needs to be changed accordingly.]]  
The parties agree that to the extent either of the parties is required to 
report any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to the 
Transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, such party shall 
report such item consistent with the characterization set forth above and 
shall not take any position on any tax return or report relating to United 
States federal income taxes which is inconsistent with such 
characterization.  The parties recognize that the manner in which they have 
agreed to characterize the Transaction for United States federal income tax 
purposes may be different from the manner in which the Transaction is 
characterized for non-United States federal income tax purposes and for 
accounting, regulatory or other purposes.  The provisions of this Section are 
not intended to affect the manner in which the parties report the Transaction 
for such other purposes, or the interpretation of the provisions of the 
Confirmation and the rights and obligations of the Parties arising hereunder, 
for any purposes.



Below is my listing of the remaining projects.

1.  Finish painting sunroom.
2.  Paint bedroom furniture.
3.  Replace two front door thresholds.
4.  Put mailbox in Nancy & Peter's front door.  They have the hardware.
5.  Sheetrock over their livingroom bookcase at Nancy & Peter's.
6.  Paint outdoor pipes same color as house.
7.  I spoke to Bob Goss, they took the light fixture cover out of my back 
stairwell (it's in the ceiling) and lost it.  Bob asked if you could replace 
it for him and send him the bill.
8.  Additional plumbing (1) airconditioning pipe, and (2) washing machine 
hoses in back of garage, and cover open drain near door to garage bathroom 
plumbing.

That should do it!  Stephanie rightly pointed out that I was confusing Utilcorp w/Pacific Gas and 
Electric.  Just call me Roseannaroseannatana!

Attached is the corrected list for 6/20/00 to open Utilicorp for all products 
except pulp & paper.

As Frank indicated below, below is a new bandwidth product being introduced 
online.  Frequently, if we have a new product and it is close enough in 
character to another product, we just mirror the approvals we have already 
given to the mirrored product.  Does this strategy work for you, or are there 
any issues we are unfamiliar with that would require us to review this 
product in a totally different manner?

I am trying to track down in London the author of an ISDA Schedule on the 
deal between ECT and the ETOL Trust.  The top of the Schedule says "Milbank 
Draft" and the document # on the botton says LN1: #20030058v5.  Robina 
Barker-Bennett in Treasury left Mark Taylor an email about this, and I left 
her a voicemail trying to track down the document, but haven't heard back.  I 
would think the document was prepared by one of your lawyers.  Mark needs the 
computer document so we can do a blackline against another agreement here in 
Houston.

Can you see what you can do to track it down for me.  I'd appreciate it.Is Global Finance Gary Hickerson's Group?  Credit is the only group besides

Thanks!Per my conversation with Credit, the referenced counterparty has now provided 
the letter of credit that will enable them to become an eligible swap 
participant.  Therefore, I am opening them up to trade financial.  They will 
come through as an amendment on tonight's list.Per our discussion, attached is my rough draft of the Legal Script.  Just to 
save you the time and effort of having people read for the part, may I 
suggest Julia Roberts to play my role in the film.  She's already got this 
paralegal thing down with the Erin Brokovitch role...

P.S. I almost have the 6/22 list done.  There is one more counterparty 
credit/power is working on.  And I have the 6/23 and 6/26 lists done, I just 
have to write them up.  I'll have them to you soon.Mike,

Can you grant George Hope with the Online Team, view access only to the Legal 
Online Trading Database.  Can you let us know when his approval comes in.  
Thanks!I got the confirmation that you are signed up for Deriviatives I on Aug. 9 
and 10, so you don't need to worry about it.  I will be taking the class too!

We are trying to track you down an office.  Our floor is completely full 
right now, between permanent people and contract workers, so we're having to 
do some shifting.  They are getting ready to rebuild the floor, maybe build 
some more internal offices or make some smaller, because of the lack of 
space.  Something y'all can relate to there in London!I am still waiting on approval for MRT Energy Marketing Company (and my list 
from 6/22), pending on your determination as to whether it is a division or a 
subsidiary of Reliant Energy Services, Inc.Stacy,

Jeff asked me to pass this on to you for handling:

Tom Nuelle (pronounced "Nelly"), Risk Manager at BP Amoco called, and said 
they need to assign a physical trade from one Amoco entity to another.  The 
trade was done w/Amoco Energy Trading and they need to assign it to Amoco 
Canada.  It's a Nov-March,EOL Deal no. 265080.  Tom's phone # is 
281/366-4034.  Tom Moran from Credit had no problem moving the trade.I would be glad to send him the link if you can send me the link.

I discussed this w/Frank, and wanted to make the other two of you aware,  
since this is a Bermuda corporation, they are only allowed to trade the US 
segment of bandwidth.  Since this is the only segment we are trading online 
yet, this isn't an issue.  But as we move forward and add more segments we 
are going to have to keep in mind that although a counterparty may have been 
open for US, we need to consider if they can trade other country based 
segments as we add them in the future.We have received the executed Master Energy Price Swap Agreement with Belco 
Oil & Gas Corp. dated as of July 8, 1999.  We have also received the executed 
Assignment and Assumption Agreement wherein the trades under the existing 
Belco Operating Corp. Master Energy Price Swap Agreement will be assigned to 
the Belco Oil & Gas Corp. master.  No trading will continue under the Belco 
Operating Corp. master.  The two active Belco masters will be the Belco Oil & 
Gas Corp. master and the Belco Energy Corp. master.

Copies will be distributed.Attached is the script revised w/Mark Taylor's comments.
We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced 
Counterparty dated June 18, 2000.  Copies will be be sent Dave Samuels and 
Teresa Smith.Teresa Smith was my contact on this one.

Attached is a list containing the new MG counterparties.  You can see it by 
clicking on the second tab at the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet  where it 
says "MG New Cpys".  Ignore the first tab.  I am told by London Legal that 
our deadline for responding to this list is Monday.  

Bandwidth team, in talking to London Legal, per my current understanding, the 
only two jurisdictions approved to trade bandwidth are the US and UK.  We've 
got Japan and Bermuda approved to trade US segment only.  So unless we hear 
otherwise from you, it is our intention to give all the other counterparties 
"read only" access.

		 Subject: Pacific Gas & electric Company

Frank:
I spoke with her attorney yesterday and believe that I addressed her concerns 
with the ETA, GTC and Password Application forms.  She is going to add 
language to the Password Application that makes it clear that any GTC is 
considered to be "signed" and "in writing" if they are required by the 
Website to click on it.  Her main concern given the fact that we now have a 
Master in place with them is that they are not asked to accept the terms of a 
GTC and I assured her that so long as she has a Master in place that covers 
the product that she wants to trade that they will not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  Anyway, putting this language in the PA seemed to make her feel 
better.  Once you receive the PA from her why don't you fax it to me  and I 
will let you know if it is acceptable.

Also, as I discussed with Stephanie yesterday, they wanted to do a "test" run 
on the Website to check to make sure that they would not be asked to accept a 
GTC.  I told her that the only way to do this would be to click on a product 
description once they get their password.  I understand that you and Tana 
will coordinate with each other when the time comes to make sure that the 
ISDA Master that they executed gets coded into the Website at the proper time 
so that when they do click on a product description, no GTC appears.

Please call me if you have any questions.

We have received the following executed ISDA Master Agreement:

Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)

Effective Date:  05/15/00

Executed Date:  06/09/00

Enron Entity:  Enron North America Corp.

Counterparty:  Pacific Gas & Electric Company

Transactions Covered: All products covered except pulp & paper and FX

ALL PARTIES PLEASE NOTE:  

1. DIVISION TRADING.  This counterparty may elect to do additional financial 
trading under two divisions, its Core Procurement Department or its 
California Gas Transmission Department.  If the Counterparty does elect to 
trade under these divisions, such trades should also be done under this 
master agreement.  No other divisions should be approved for any financial 
trading for Pacific Gas & Electric Company without prior approval from 
Legal.  However, for regulatory purposes, payments cannot be netted between 
Pacific Gas & Electric Company and any/either of the two divisions.  All 
payments must be treated separately.  It is critical that the 
PAYMENT/SETTLEMENT GROUP captures this correctly.

(CREDIT, the agreement does provide for closeout netting.)

2. Canadian and US Trades:  All financial trades with this counterparty, 
whether entered in with Houston or Calgary traders must be done under this 
master agreement.  THE CONFIRMATION DESK needs to make note of this.

3. GLOBAL CONTRACTS:  When we open them up to trade online, we need to make 
sure that all of the financial products go under this master agreement.  
Under no circumstance should they see a GTC if they transact any financial 
product.

3. ONLINE TRADING:  It is critical that  the above information is captured 
correctly before we can open them up for online trading.  I will verbally 
confirm with each of the Online Team, Confirmation Desk, Global Contracts, 
and Payments/Settlements that we have this setup correctly before Legal 
approves them to trade online. 
I say let them eat cake!

I believe this means only that we are not closing a deal today.  I would
still like the contracts, please, in anticipation that we may yet do a deal.

		 Subject: NYMEX F/S

ENA BA&R is currently in the process of preparing the 12/31/99 financial 
statements to be filed with the NYMEX by July 21st in order to keep our 
trading seat.  These financial statements reflect all of the North America 
trading operations.  ECTEG1 is ENA's legal rollup within Hyperion and should 
reflect all of the North American trading (i.e., price risk management) 
activity.  Therefore, Consolidated Reporting, with the assistance of Trading 
Accounting and Tax, prepared the financial statements with ECTEG1 activity.  
These financial statements are complete and ready for BA&R management review 
and reflect $722MM in earnings.

However, as of 6/29, we were notified by the Tax department that three 
companies were included in ECTEG1 as of 12/31/99 that were no longer legal 
owned by ENA.  In addition, there was one company that became ENA owned 
during 1999.  The companies are as follows:

Improperly Included:
ECM Treasury Consolidated  (Company 969)
ECT Retail Services    (Company 1Q6)
ECT Power Marketing, Inc. - Retail  (Company 890)

Improperly Excluded:
Enron Gas Liquids, Inc.    (Company 104)

I have corresponded with Tana Jones from the Legal department, Johnson Leo in 
Corporate Reporting, and Julie Gartner from the Tax department to determine if
the financial statements that we prepared reflected accurate and complete 
North America trading activity.  These discussions confirmed that the 
Hyperion legal 
structure was not accurately reflecting ENA's actual legal ownership.  In 
addition, the three companies have $192MM in trading activity income that 
would be
removed from the bottom line.  This activity should probably be reported to 
the NYMEX (regardless of legal structure) as it represents price risk 
management
activity.

The primary issue is accuracy of the financial statements.  We are prepared 
to have to restate the compiled financials as soon as we are notified where
we can retrieve accurate ledger information.  The other main issue is 
timing.  We need to file these financial statements no later than July 21st.  
Before that can
happen they need to be reviewed by several levels of management in several 
departments.

The Legal department is currently reviewing the NYMEX requirements in order 
to determine the proper activity to report.  As soon as that is determined, 
we can
proceed with data retrieval.

Please contact me if have any questions, concerns or comments.

DTYou are so very welcome!

We really haven't used the Local Currency form in several years.  We found 
that we were getting requests to switch to the Multicurrency Form so 
frequently that we made the Multicurrency our primary form.  In the long run 
we have found that the Multicurrency Form gives us the most flexibility as 
the trading markets become more international in nature.  If you prefer the 
Local Currency it may take me asome time when we get back on Wednesday to 
compare the forms and convert the document over.  Please let me know if that 
is your preference.

I don't think Tom sent anything out for Friday.

You crack me up!  Your baby report made me laugh!  Keep me posted on how the 
kids are doing.  I enjoy your stories.

All my home improvements are about done.  I've finally put in central air, 
repainted the interior, exterior, redone the hardwoods and landscaped, 
including a fountain in the backyard.  It looks like a new house!  The final 
job will be new carpets and window treatments when I can get around to it.  
I've been doing this for a year, and as you well know, it gets old living in 
a construction site.

I don't know if this is the final battle with the squirrels, or if we'll be 
at it again for another winter.  I thought I had most of their holes for 
getting in closed, but with all this new construction (the central air & 
heaters in my attics, with various lines coming out of the attic), I'll 
probably have to go through it again this winter.  I vow to prevail!

Keep in touch...!  I spoke to Serge Martin, their outside counsel, and he said it's on his list, 
but he hasn't been able to get to it.  Maybe in another month...We have received the executed Assignment and Novation of Transactions dated 
June 28, 2000 wherein Statoil Energy Trading, Inc. ("Assignor") assigned its 
interest in certain natural gas wholesale and derivatives transactions with 
Enron North America Corp. to J. Aron & Company ("Assignee").

 A copy of the trades being assigned is attached to the assignment which will 
be distributed to the usual distribution group, plus Bob Klein.
I am a Senior Legal Specialist in the ENA Legal Department, Financial Trading 
Group.  I wasn't put on as a reviewer for Mike Neves, but I wanted to tell 
you what a good job he has been doing for our group.

I am responsible for the databases in our group.  During the past year we 
have had two major projects going on with respect to the databases our group 
uses.  First, we have had a major upgrade to an existing database, the Master 
Swap Agreement Database (now called the Financial Trading Agreements 
Database).  This upgrade including adding a number of new items within the 
database, as well as creating security on some of the confidential legal data 
maintained in the database, so the database could be opened company wide, 
while maintaining the secure legal information.  Second, in response to the 
online trading system, we needed to immediately create a database to keep 
track of the Legal Department's approvals of the online counterparties.  This 
need for this database came on quickly (as has everything associated with 
online trading!), and having that data available enabled us to quickly 
respond to our client, the online trading group.

Mike has done a wonderful job both upgrading our existing database and 
helping create the new online database.  His quick turnaround, understanding 
of our needs, attention to detail (while at the same time remaining cheerful 
while we, as I'm sure other groups pressed him with deadlines) has helped us 
meet the needs of our clients.

Mike continues to give us prompt attention when needed, and he is certainly a 
valuable asset to your team!
In case you were wondering...

Just as we got the assignment of the natgas trades in, I got a call from 
Anita Herrera, the attorney for Statoil, saying she is sending me an 
assignment of the crude trades tomorrow.  It won't be as painful a process, 
since she told me we they only have one or two crude trades left on the 
books.  Anyway, I wanted to give you a head's up (and maybe to keep any 
collateral you might have to cover the crude trades!)...Boy, was she quick.  We appear to have only one trade to assign, so Credit, I 
guess you are OK with this, and Bob, you don't show any other crude trades do 
you?

(Canada), the yearly rate of interest to which any rate of interest payable 
under this Agreement that is calculated on any basis other than a full 
calendar year is equivalent may be determined by multiplying such rate by a 
fraction the numerator of which is the actual number of days in the calendar 
year in which such yearly rate of interest is to be ascertained and the 
denominator of which is the number of days comprising such other basis. 

Do we need to have the highlighted language exactly as it is, or can we have 
a general statement to the effect that the interest rate shall not exceed the 
maximun non-usurious rate and interest shall be paid on the actual number of 
days elapsed, based on a 365/366 day year?  Is there some special magic to 
the above highlighted language?

Robbi,

What impact will the advice below have on our Japanese bandwidth approvals?  
Right now I have them OK to trade the US segment.  Based on the advice below 
do you think we will need to get a license as a "telecommunications 
carrier"?  Should I shut Japan down for now?

		 Subject: Re: Master BWT Agreement



Michelle,

I discussed the corporate authorization issue with Mika Suzuki, a Japanese 
lawyer in our office.

1.  Basically, we believe that Japanese corporations can enter into the 
Master Bandwidth Purchase and Sale Agreement.

     A.  There is no specific internal authorization required in Japanese 
corporate law and practice, unless the transaction is considered 
"important."  Obviously, the question of what is "important" is relative.

     B.  Generally, larger companies have internal directors' rules that 
specify a monetary amount above which transactions must be subject to board 
approval.  Outsiders are usually not privy to that information and, having no 
notice thereof, are not prejudiced by failure of the company to follow its 
own internal approval procedures.  There is case law to support that notion 
with regard to the claims of innocent contract counter parties.

     C.  However, if the counter party has notice that board approval is 
required, but has not been obtained, or the counter party is "negligent" 
(like a constructive notice type of situation) the counter party will not 
have the benefit of any lack of authority argument or defense.

     D.  We note that the draft Master Agreement provides a representation 
and warranty regarding due authorization in Section 10.(a)(iv).  Although not 
determinative, this provision should be considered by a Japanese court.

     E.  As the execution of the Master Agreement does not involve a specific 
transaction and transaction amount, it is unlikely that it would fall into 
this "important" matter category requiring board approval.  However, the 
transactions will have to be judged on a case-by-case basis.

2.  A.  In the BWT context, if the bandwidth purchaser is not going to use 
the bandwidth itself (i.e., the purchaser plans to re-sell the bandwidth), 
the purchaser will have to be licensed as a telecommunications carrier under 
the Telecommunications Business Law of Japan (the "TBL").

     B.  In order to be licensed as a telecommunications carrier, the general 
rule is that the registered business purpose of the corporation must specify 
that its business purpose is to carry on telecommunications business.  
(Please see the corporate register of the Applications YK and Network YK for 
examples of this.)  We note that the draft Master Agreement provides a 
representation and warranty regarding licensing in Section 10.(a)(iii).

     C.  Basically, a violation of the licensing requirement should not 
affect the validity of the contract, but simply result in the bandwidth 
trader becoming subject to the penal provisions of the TBL.  However, one 
should keep in mind that the intention of the TBL is to protect the public 
good and, to the extent that disregard of its licensing requirements in 
connection with BWT might be considered a threat to or undermining of the 
integrity of the telecommunications system, broader regulatory action may be 
a possibility.  In that regard, an action for specific performance of a 
bandwidth delivery obligation by the unlicensed trader may be problematic.


We hope this answers your initial question.

Best regards.

Jeff

>>> <Michelle_Hicks@enron.net> 06/27/00 05:28AM >>>


Jeff,  Here is the latest version of the Master Agreement.  The scope of the
review at this time is limited to whether Japanese companies are authorized to
enter into such an agreement.  I will let you know when or if the traders are
interested in having the form reviewed from a Japanese law perspective.  
Please
let me or Cynthia know if you have any questions or comments.  Best regards,
Michelle

We have received the executed amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreement 
with the referenced counterparty dated June 23, 2000.  Copies will be

believe).I'm working with the "Click Paper.com" legal team toward the migration of the 
pulp & paper trades to that website.  In oder to determine whether any of the 
counterparties that have actually traded pulp & paper online have amended the 
ETA, I need to get a list of the counterparties that have trade pulp & paper 
online.  Can someone down there prepare such a list for me?

Thanks!Re: the Statoil Assignment

The Statoil master will not be terminated. They sold their existing natgas & 
crude oil book to J. Aron.  They may trade other products out of that master, 
or it is possible they might want to enter into future trades in those 
products.  So, the trades reflected in the assignment should be moved under 
the J. Aron master.  Everything else should remain the same.You would need to talk to Mike Moscosco.  I don't know, but perhaps they 
don't change the report for a 1 month approval only.

SECOND REQUEST


Tana,


I was hoping that you could answer a question for me. 

I have a copy of a NYMEX approval letter dated June 5, 2000 plus the 
interoffice memorandum
detailing the increase of Henry Hub Natural Gas positions from 17,000 to 
20,000.  They state that
this is in regards to the July ONLY contract.

However, the ECT generated report for Limits (the report Moscoso's group 
creates) dated June 19, 2000 
doesn't show this increase under the "Delivery Month Limit Amount" column for 
July NG contracts.
In turn,  the red flag, "approaching limit", pops up on the 21st.  This is 
b/c  the limit is still at 17,000 instead
of 20,000; the red flag probably wouldn't have popped up if the limit had 
been raised.  

Tell me your thoughts.

Thank you so much for all of your help.
If you have any questions please give me a call, x31684.

Sincerely, 

Jack Ehrig



Gene,

As you my recall, you returned the original subcontractor letter with respect 
to the referenced agreement as you were unable to locate the original Project 
Services Agreement in Enron's files.  I was just talking to Carol St. Clair, 
one of the attorneys I work for, and we are of the agreement that we cannot 
sign this side subcontractor letter until we track down where the original 
agreement is.  How can we locate the orignal agreement within Enron Corp.?I am working with the Click Paper.com lawyers on their online documentation, 
and they want to see a UK form of financial GTC.  Can you send me one?

We are also usually sent a page from some tax book that show the rate of 
withholding for each of the treaty countries.  Their rate of withholding will 
impact which form we may or may not need.  Can you send it to me?  Thanks!

The page out of the book we were sent last year says "Treaty Withholding Tax 
Rates" , and under it is says "The following are US withholding tax rates for 
dividend, interest and royalty payments from the United States to residents 
of various treaty countries.  Then below there it has a list which shows the 
Country, Dividends %, Interest%, Patent and Know-how Royalties.

What type of income is potentially subject to w/h tax?  I assume you're 
looking for the interest w/h tax rates.

I'm not sure if you would consider this just another Nat Gas phy product or

Let me know your thoughts.

Subject: Re: new hub product descriptions  

Item 1 - Agreed; see my Revision Marks.

Item 2 - How about listing the Contract Price as the difference between the 
Bid and Offer; see my Revision Marks.

Also, are you suggesting we change the Product Short Descriptions to what you 
have placed in bold? If so, then your Product Short description on the 
website will be redundant, and look like this:  

Chicago Phy Gas Park Chi Peoples 20Jun00-Jul00 USD/MM; 

and if you ever wanted to offer another Product based on a different Location 
it would be messy:

Chicago Phy Gas Park Mich Con 20Jun00-Jul00 USD/MM, 

so we would have to build another Product Type. I think that it's important 
to leave the Product Type generic (i.e. 'US Gas Phy Loan') which would allow 
you to transact on other locations (i.e. US Gas Phy Loan   Mich Con  20Jun00 
-Jul00 USD/MM; or US Gas Phy Loan   Demarc  20Jun00 -Jul00 USD/MM) and we can 
set those up quickly and easily.

I would really like to get these last issues finalized as quickly as 
possible. Building the Product Type is easy; chasing everyone down to get 
their part done is where I start running into time delays.

Subject: new hub product descriptions

I have changed the Product description again, but I think that this will be 
the final change.  Please review the Product example worksheet for a detailed 
examples of how I think these products will work.  

Dale,

I have modified your long product description for both the Park and the Loan 
products.  Hunter and I have reviewed your description and we have the 
following comments:

1.  We should ensure that both "legs" of these transactions are firm.  
Currently only the "payback" portion of the transaction is labeled as firm.

2.  Do we need to state the Contract price is the difference between the 
sales and purchase price.  I will make my market based on these prices, but 
there are many other factors that will effect my actual bids/offers. 

Additonally, we are still waiting for product manager set-up on our 
computers; although, we have been approved for these products by security.  
Thanks


Richard

I was chatting with Chapman yesterday, and he tells me the movie you were in

Can we see your face?  Does your horse have special markings so we can tell 
it's you?  I'm going to have to watch it in slo mo when it comes out in video!

This is quite exciting.  I guess next thing you'll be hiring an agent (for 
you and/or your horse, depending on who gets better reviews?!)...I thought that body looked pretty buff!  I should have known it was you.  So 
you got paid extra for the horse and the body double work!

Edmund,

Gordon Boozer at Swiss Re has suggested that we use the existing ISDA
Master Agreement between Swiss Re and ENA as a template for the
EnronCredit.com Schedule.  Denis and I agree that this is a reasonable
approach, provided that we carve-out any business / reps / credit terms
peculiar to ENA.  I should be grateful if you would send me a copy of the
ENA-Swiss Re Schedule by e-mail / fax (0207 330 9999) at your earliest
convenience.

Many thanks,

James

Subject:  Re: Bank ISDA credit




Edmund,

Two further questions:

1.  Automatic Early Termination.  The Policies and Concessions Guidelines
table indicates that AET should be applied / disapplied in accordance with
the recommendations contained in the ISDA netting opinions, as summarised
by the matrix recently provided to Enron by Cathy Ryan.  However, where the
matrix indicates that AET is "Recommended", but is not "Necessary", what do
you want us to specify?

Please note that generally we think that Automatic Early Termination should
not apply unless there is some legal advantage in including it (ie. where
local counsel has indicated that it is necessary/strongly recommended in
order to enforce close-out netting under the particular insolvency rules
applicable to the counterparty).  This is because there are practical
disadvantages associated with it.  The main disadvantages are:

(a)  the fact that it cannot be waived by the Non-defaulting Party, which
therefore loses its discretion as to whether and        when to terminate;
and

(b)  the risk that Early Termination will occur without the knowledge of
the Non-defaulting Party.

As  far  as  we  are  aware,  Automatic Early Termination is currently only
necessary  in  relation  to counterparties located in Denmark. As a result,
you  may  wish  to  consider  disapplying  Automatic  Early  Termination in
relation to counterparties in all other jurisdictions.  Please note that we
understand  that Automatic Early Termination is recommended (although it is
not  necessary) for counterparties located in Singapore, Switzerland, Japan
and the Netherlands.   As a result of these recommendations, you may prefer
that   Automatic  Early Termination continues to apply.  Please let me know
how  you  would  like  me  to  revert  to proceed in the first draft of the
Schedules where AET is recommended, but not necessary..

2. Date of the Agreement.  I should be grateful if you would provide us
with details of the date of the first trade for each counterparty where
EnronCredit.com Limited has an existing trading relationship with the
counterparty.  If we have not received this information before the first
draft Schedules and cover faxes are ready for distribution, then we will
add these details in a later draft.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Many thanks,

James

Ted,

Question 15 of the annual NYMEX hedge exemptions asks us to describe in 
detail:  "the system of internal controls administered in the supervision of 
the applican't risk management programs, i.e., describe the risk assessment 
policies and procedures in place for evaluation and supervision of risk 
management programs, including "stress-testing" for extraordinary price 
volatility, and state frequency supervision is conducted."

Attached is the response we have given the NYMEX in prior years.  Are there 
any changes in our procedures/control that would necessiate a change in that 
language?
We have a list of the London attorneys and paralegals attached to our ECT 
Legal Dept. List that we maintain.  Do you want me to send you a list?  Where

It was good seeing you.  Thanks for dinner.  Shawna and I were waiting for 
your call about a coffee (she even said she'd buy!), but I guess we missed 
you for this trip.  She sends her regards!

I harassed Justy about his movie career.  He told me he was the body double 
for Russell Crowe.  I asked him whether he and/or his horse had hired agents 
yet (depending on who was getting better reviews!) 

Keep me posted on the house.  It looked great!Is this only available to the Legal Group?  There are a few people in Credit 
and Global Contracts that might find this helpful.  Please add me to the

I spoke to Tanya and she said they only do energy trading through J. Aron, 
all the interest rate and currency trading is done through Goldman, so we 
don't need language re: that business.  Also, I ran it by her, and she does 
want the language in the credit rating section of the MAC about "not 
supported by third party credit enhancement."We have finally received comments on the ISDA from the referenced 
counterparty.  I have sent copies to each of you.  There were substantial 
comments to the guaranty so I have sent a copy of the guaranty along with the 
comments to Clem.

Clem,  congrats on that trophy!John, I've been out of the office for two days and just got in.   I take it 
that Cowlitz PUD is a governmental entity?  Our usual sample form does not 
have the governmental provisions.  I would think we would want to send them a 
sample with those provisions in there, because they would be rather surprised 
if they got a draft from us at some point and it had all these additional 
provisions in there.  Can you confirm for me that they are a 
governmental/quasi-governmental?  Also, have you requested credit from 
Credit?

We will split the guaranty with a Coastal guaranty for Engage US and

these letters

I would be happy to come up and retrieve them as soon as you have them ready.
If you have any questions, please give me ( 3-0443) or Joe ( 3-3316) a call.

Thanks - we're looking forward to being able to implement this procedure.

There is no documentation to evidence this, it is an operation of law.  Being 
a legal incorporated entity means you are embodied as a legal entity after 
filing or creating certain organizational documents under state or federal 
laws (you could be a corporation, partnership,  governmental entity or other 
type of entity).   A division is not a separate legal incorporated entity.   
It is one and the same entity as the incorporated entity.   It is a "dba"  
(which means "doing business as") or "assumed name" for an incorporated 
entity. Any division of an incorporated entity can, and usually should, trade 
under the same master as the incorporated entity (unless the company gives us 
some reason elsewise).  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not 
understand that a division and incorporated entity are one and the same, or 
there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their trading from being 
aggregated.That is why we always want the name of the incorporated entity as 
part of the counterparty name when we transact with a division.  Examples 
might be "Tana Jones Inc., acting through its TLJ Company Division" or "Tana 
Jones Inc. d/b/a TLJ  Company" or "TLJ Company, a division of Tana Jones 
Inc."  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not understand that a 
division and incorporated entity are one and the same (and we may have to 
talk to them), or there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their 
trading from being aggregated with the corporate entity.  Legal and/or Credit 
should direct you when a division should trade under the legal entity's 
master.  

P.S. Susan Flynn is on an extended leave of absence.

		 Subject: Clarification of Cargill issue

Tana,

I'm hoping you can clarify some information I received second-hand on 
Cargill, Incorporated, and Cargill Energy, a division of Cargill, 
Incorporated.   It is my understanding that Cargill Energy, a division of 
Cargill, Incorporated, is allowed to trade under the ISDA (contract  
96043502) between Cargill, Incorporated and ENA.   Based on the information 
in the Legal Financial Trading Agreement database, there is no information to 
indicate that this affiliate is also covered by the Cargill, Incorporated 
master .  Also, the email from Susan Flynn  does not include any information 
on additional parties covered under this contract.  Finally, Part 4(b) of the 
schedule to the agreement specifies that for Section 10(c) of the contract , 
neither party is a multibranch party.  This is all the information that 
Anthony Campos has received to date on this contract.  Based on this 
information, and from previous requests from Legal for Global Contracts to 
refer any interpretations to Legal, the Global Contracts group could not make 
any assumptions regarding other counterparties not specifically listed on the 
contract or schedules.  

I wanted to verify if what I had heard about Cargill Energy, a division of 
Cargill, Incorporated, was correct and to obtain the pertinent documentation 
if so.  Also, does Legal have any specific "policies" regarding affiliate 
relationships?  Is there any documentation we should have been aware of?

I just want to make sure that there are no EOL issues in the future and that 
we have not misinterpreted any information.  Please let me know how Legal 
handles such an issue and what actions Global Contracts can expect.

As usual, thanks for you help and patience.

Deb,

Can you check the VP list for Bill.  He was promoted to VP of Enron North 
America Corp. in January and, looking at the corporate database, his name is 
not showing up on the list.

Thanks!In order to prepare a Confidentiality Agreement, I will need the following 
information:

1.  The company's full legal name
2.  Whether we want a bilateral or Enron Protected Counterparty form
3.  What is the nature of the protected information (what project or type of 
transaction is it for)
4.  The company's address, phone number and fax number
5.  Any timing involved for getting this signed (is there a meeting Monday 
morning at 9:00 am, so it's a rush, or just send it out, we're starting to 
talk to them)Bill,  I looked, and you're not a VP of Enron Corp. either.  Maybe you need 
to give Rick Buy a call so we can straighten this out...

Deb,

Can you check the VP list for Bill.  He was promoted to VP of Enron North 
America Corp. in January and, looking at the corporate database, his name is 
not showing up on the list.

Thanks!

Per our conversation, attached is the Authorized Trader List.  Can you have 
Gary review it Monday when he gets back, as we are opening a new brokerage 
account and we need to provide the list to the brokerage firm.
Do you have any updates to the Pulp & Paper group?Why do we want Andy to sign the draft going out?  If it's not a rush, it 
makes us look heavy handed to send a signed document, giving a tone like 
"this is not negotiable!".

Hi Tana,

To answer your questions 

1. The companys full name is NatSource LLC
2. I'm not sure but it should be exactly the same as what we sent to True 
Quote, Houston Street and Espeed.
3. The project is for posting EOL prices on NatSources Electronic Trading 
Platform.
4. The companys address is 
Nat Source LLC 
140 Broadway
30th Floor, New York
NY 10005
It should be sent to the attention of Jack Hogan (Tel 212-232-5335, 
fax-212-232-5354) Their General Counsel is Andrew O Connor (tel 
212-286-1234). Andy Zipper will sign the document before it is sent.
5. Its not a rush we're just starting to talk to them.

I hope this gives you all the information you need. Thanks a lot. 

Savita

Subject: Confidentiality Agreements

In order to prepare a Confidentiality Agreement, I will need the following 
information:

1.  The company's full legal name
2.  Whether we want a bilateral or Enron Protected Counterparty form
3.  What is the nature of the protected information (what project or type of 
transaction is it for)
4.  The company's address, phone number and fax number
5.  Any timing involved for getting this signed (is there a meeting Monday 
morning at 9:00 am, so it's a rush, or just send it out, we're starting to 
talk to them)



I'm still trying to get an appointment set up with the Documentum people.  
One of the things I need to get from you is what is the current software you 
are using, so they know what software they've got to be compatible with.  Can 
you send me an email back.  Thanks.Brent Hendry, an attorney that used to be in our group in Houston, then went 
to Argentina, is now back.  He had review only access to the Master Swap 
Agreement database.  Can you get him added ASAP with full edit capability.  
Thanks!Scott,

Is there someone else in your group who can get Brent access to the Financial 
Trading Agreement Database?

I appreciate your help in this matter.

We need to set up a new database as soon as possible when you get back.  We 
have a new online trading system starting Tuesday, ClickPaper.com, and I will 
need to mirror the Online Trading Database.

Can you call me when you get back.Attached is the referenced list.  I understand that the Western Area Power 
Administration - Upper Great Plain has been bugging us to get opened up for 
physical power, so you might want to give a rush approval on that one.
No divisions should be opened up without the legal name as part of the title 
of the account, or the confirms will not go out right.  You have two on the 
7/14/00 list, TXU Gas Distribution, a division of TXU Gas Company, and 
Western Area Power Administration-Upper Great plain, a division of the United 
States Department of Energy.  Can you please change the name on the 
accounts.  I thought we came to agreement that this is what we would do for 
divisions, and Legal would be contacted if they wouldn't add the legal name 
on to the account.   The people who approve Password Applications should be 
sorting this out.

Can you please let me know how these two get resolved.  Thanks.FYI.

1.  Guaranty dated as of February 10, 1998 by PG&E Corporation in favor of

I received the original PG&E Energy Trading Corporation guaranty in favor of

Not much going on.  I'm still trying to get Documentum to do a demonstration 
for me.  I keep getting general marketing people, even though I tell them I'm 
interested only in derivatives software, and to get a derivative person to 
call me.  I haven't gotten anyone yet that speaks my language yet.  Then the 
fellow was a little condescending with me about price, like I can't afford 
their services.  When I first spoke to them I told them to check the Enron 
web page to get more information about our company but it doesn't appear that 
they've done their homework.  They're about to lose my business.

In the end I think Mark is agreeing with me that we're going to design our 
own software.  I still like IPI a lot, but they're only one component of the 
project.  The Confirm Desk is still really interested in getting some 
software, and between the two groups it might make buying software for 
document creation more attractive.
Below is a RUSH list that we need to approve by the end of the day.  From the 
US, the only response I expect will be from Leslie, with all declines for 
power.  I NEED TO HEAR FROM AUSTRALIA TODAY ON THEIR COUNTERPARTIES.

One of their guys will go to Japan soon to 'promote' it.

Mark,

I am sorry, but there seems to be a little confusion in our shop about who 
your attorney should be on this deal.  I was given Andrew O'Connor's name, 
and left him a message to which he finally responded.  He is now expecting to 
see this CA.  I have now been given Wesley Fredericks name as your attorney.  
I don't want to cause any conflict between attorneys, and wanted to get your 
direction as to how I should handle this.

I am Tana Jones, and I am a paralegal in the Legal Department and my phone 
number is 713/853-3399.  I have attached the referenced spreadsheet, changing my product approvals to 
add the new product list that Stephanie sent me (instead of th eold list 
Credit sent me).  One of the new products appears to be Austrian physical 
power.  Like the other European based physical power products, it should not 
be opened for the US based credit counterparties to trade, so I will not be 
marking it out on a going forward basis, I will just expect it to be shut 
down for the US based counerparties (unless I tell you otherwise on a 
particular one).  Is that OK with you.

Also, for Sempra, they will be coming by again on the 7/21 list (Credit 
opened them up for all financial power).  I had already opened them up for 
all financial products except weather, so it shouldn't affect my approval.
Attached is the referenced list.  There are only 2 counterparties for 
approval on this list, and I have problems with each of them.

Virginia Electric and Power Company is coming through as an amendment to add 
financial power.  I still cannot open them up until we resolve directly with 
the company what issue, if any, there appears to be doing financial products 
with utilities under Virginia law.  Notes in our database reflect that this 
was an issue and they were creating a marketing sub to do the business.  I 
have a call into Credit to find out who their contact is, we will have to 
resolve this directly with them.

Again, TXU Lone Star Pipeline is coming through as a division of TXU Gas 
Company, and that needs to be made part of the name.

I got a call while you were away from a woman at an affiliate of National 
Bank of Canada, they want to see our standard form of Repo Agreement to put 
in place for one of their affiliates "Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc.", 1155 
Metcalfe Street, Montreal, QB  H3B 5G2. The contact is Theresa Pace (French 
pronounced) and her # is (514) 397-5850.  I spoke to Harry Arora about it, 
and he said Darren Delage is working on it, and Darren is out the week on 
vacation and to wait til he gets back next week to send it out.  So when you 
have a minute, let's talk about what to do.At the request of Andy Zipper, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Confidentiality Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 if you have any 
comments or questions.  
Alan & Harry

Since your group is the only other group besides the financial group that has 
a product on the pulp & paper website, it is my intention to only send the 
two of you their spreadsheets.  However, it appears the physical side of the 
business (except for power) never says no, so if you prefer, I won't send you 
the list.  It's up to you.  Let me know.

Tana - Attached is the file of customers who have been approved by Tom Moran 
in credit for Clickpaper.  Please review from a Legal standpoint and let us 
know which ones legal approves.

Camille, Jarrod - The file below is in O:/P&P/Clickpaper/PCG .  I think we 
should save these as we receive them back from all checks.  Also, Tom has 
declined TFS but we should have them set up w/ a Global Counterparty ID.  The 
company already set up in GCP as TFS is actually a Singapore company so I do 
not think it is the same one.  Please fax the registration to Mary Gosnell.  
We can then register TFS in Clickpaper w/ a "guest id".  You will also need 
to update Jarrod's daily registration report that he is preparing for the 
traders and check w/ Bob before sending back a "Reject" letter to these that 
Tom has declined - Bob may want to set up a "guest id" for them.

Let me know if you have questions.
Thanks,
Michelle

Per my conversation with Frank, Utilicorp. was originally shut down for 
financial because it was on the original "utility" list, when we shut down 
all the utilities for financial until we did the due diligence.  Since then, 
we are opening the utilities up, so long as they are not governmental 
utilities.

Second, we have since got an ISDA master in place with Utilicorp. (and moved 
the Aquila trades under it).

Based on the above, I am opening up Utilcorp. for all financial products.The referenced counterparty has already been approved to trade all physical 
and financial products offered online.  I am not sure if we need to see this 
counterparty come through again as a Click Paper counterparty or not.  I'll 
let Tom decide.   For me, I'm OK.David,

A clarification...

On Ergon, Macxquarie Generation, Snowy and Citipower.  You say that they 
should only trade Australian power and weather.  How about all the other 
products, US, UK, Canadian physical and financial?  I am taking it literally 
and not opening them up for ANY of the other products but those.  Is that a 
correct interpretation?

Tana, thanks for expediting this Tana. The list for Australian weather is 
fine. As I mentioned I will be following up with credit on the collateral 
requirementsfor some counterparties. On Japanese weather I would suggest we 
do not load up the following Ergon, Macquarie Generation and Snowy . These 
are government power utilities and their ability to trade in products not 
linked to their business is limited. Hence they should be only trading 
Australian power and weather.

Also I would ask that Citipower be restricted to Australian power and 
weather. They are a Trust and the Trust Deed  grants the trustee the power to 
trade devivatives to hedge its Australian power operations. I would like to 
check this one out further.

Per our conversation last night, can you take a look at my list of country 
product approvals and let me know if there are any updates to the 
information.  Thanks.
I still need to see you about that Market Disruption summary for the Husky 
Oil Global Contract Datasheet so I can close up that file.Leslie,

On the attached list they have PPL Electric Utilties Corporation & PPL Energy 
Plus as amended and new, but you didn't respond to them.  I have no record on 
PPL Electric Utilities, so can you treat that as a new counterparty even 
though it says amended.  Thanks.

Attached is the referenced list.  I am still waiting on 1 response for the 
list from the 24th.
We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced 
counterparty dated 7/26/00.  Copies will be sent to Andy Zipper and a copy to 
Dave Samuels for the files.Mark said you were going to provide me with the info to do a Confidentiality 
Agreement for the Houston Chronicle.  What's the scoop there?Attached is the referenced list.  The Bakersfield California is approved to 
only do newsprint commodity swaps and options.  Therefore, I have turned them 
down to trade the current products we have available online.  As our product 
base expands, we can send them through again as an amended counterparty if we 
offer newprint commodity swaps and options online.


The resolution The Bakersfield Californian provided to us when we signed the 
ISDA Agreement with them limited the types transactions they were approved to 
do with us to "...newsprint commodity price swap and option transactions."   
In order for us to expand the type of business they can do under the ISDA 
Agreement we would need a new resolution from the Company expanding the types 
of products they are approved to do with us.Anthony, I have no idea what that questions means...

Alcoa Inc. has contacted us and would like to trade Aluminum online.  It 
appears Frank was on this initial email.  I don't know what progress, if any, 
has been made in getting the counterparty signed up online.  The person that 
contacted us is on the bottom of this email.  I will wait to see this 
counterparty come through on the Credit list.  P.S.  We do have a financial

I suggest the attached language be substituted for the current language in 
the schedules in respect of Engineering Report where  a PV/PDP mac is 
utilized.  Tana, maybe this could go as an optional insert under Docs to be 
Delivered, rather than back in the collateral schedule with the pv/pdp 
language, so people won't forget to put it in under required deliveries.  
Thanks.  Mary

I forgot one thing.  I have that rotted board on the garage wall near the 
garden, we talked about tearing that out and putting in another 2x2 or 2/4 or 
whatever it is, and then painting that.  Do you remember?

By the way, I can't believe you're alive.  By the way you've been quiet, I 
thought you were maybe in that plane too...!As a follow-up to my memo re: tax treaty countries, I called Jeff Blumenthal 
about Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania & Venezuela, since they were not on the list 
and in a separate memo, and he said that they adopted tax treaties after the 
Tax Code binder was published.I take it by PG&E Core, you mean PG&E's Core Procurement Department.  Yes, it 
should go out under the master

By way of background, the traders in Japan (Jonathan Whitehead, Morten-Erik

through Enron Japan Corp. in lieu of Enron Australia as the Enron 
counterparty, beginning the end of August 2000.

backyard!!Please keep me on the distribution for all credit worksheets.  Thanks.Carol,

Engage faxed us their form of Coastal Corporation Guaranty.  It is not clear 
to me looking in the file what I should compare it to to make sure it is OK.  
It looks like our form of guaranty, but it is not the one I sent them.  What 
do I need to do here?

Also, in terms of the approved amendment, I see one in the file with some 
hand marked changes.  Are those changes agreed to and is that what we should

Do you have a master agreement in place with Pacific Gas & Electric if you 
trade with them, or do you trade under GTC's?

I do not know.  The master was worked as a follow-up to what Christian Yoder 
had started with PG&E, no input from the desk.  They wanted one contract for 
both Enron Canada and Enron North America.  I told the person at PG&E that we 
needed separate contracts and that I would only be able to help with the 
Enron North America contract.  The contact with Enron Canada was to be Peter 
Koehane.  I believe that Peter already had and Canadian version of the 
Enfolio in place.   Please ask someone at the West Desk if they trade under 
the contract.

I looked thru the attached 10K for NSTAR and could find no "NSTAR Companies" 
entity listed there.  Maybe you'll have better luck, or are smarter and will 
find it (since I failed so miserably on you know what today!).
Fix all!  I need to tell Peter and Nancy when you'll be in their apartment.Attached please find the referenced lists.  Please note:

7/31/00 List - I am not opening up Equitable Gas Company, because it does not 
say a division of Equitable Resources Inc.  I thought that was our deal.
8/1/00 List- I cannot review NSTAR Companies yet.  There is some question as 
to whether that is a correct legal entity.




Anyone know anything about this?

Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on.All's I need now is your email w/instructions.

With regards to the division issue- we(Product Control) don't necessarily 
know that a company is a division until we receive the profile from credit.  
We then request a new PA from the company with the division language added.  
We make sure that we receive the corrected PA before we send out the password 
and user ID.

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this.

Yes, I would still like to do a movie.  We are running 2 hours and 15
minutes in the morning so I don't know what time I will be finished.  What
is your plan for running?

I don't need to spend a lot of time looking at the house, I just want you to
have a look.  I would get to do all new landscaping so I am thinking about
digging up plants at my house and putting them in pots before my property is
sold.

You for sure can't do it right after work??

I need to run to the bank.  I will be right back.

IBJ is interested in entering into a ISDA documentation with us for the 
purposes of  trading weather derivatives, pulp & paper derivatives, oil 
derivatives, lumber derivatives and metals.  Our credit department is now 
preparing a credit work sheet, so that the relevant credit language can be 
prepared.  I will contact B&M to discuss on Thursday.

Alan-

Please forward electronic copies of our standard documentation related to 
pulp & paper derivatives, oil derivatives, lumber derivatives and metals (to 
the extent there is any difference from what Marcus has already forwarded to 
B&M), for the purpose of developing such documentation for the Japanese 
market.

There does not appear to be anything that would prevent us from trading 
weather derivatives under this master.  There is a weather represenation that 
should be added to the confirmations but other than that there are no other 
modifications that I know of.  (Tana please let me know if I am wrong.)  Just 
as an aside I noted in the database that it appears that a little over a year 
an a half ago the cp wanted to do all physical and finanacial trading through 
Hess Energy Services Company LLC.  Did anything come of this?  I do not 
believe a master was signed for this entity.  I just want to confirm that 
Hess Energy Trading Company LLC is the active trading entity.

Thanks,
Brent

Brent,  we have an ISDA with this company (executed early 1998).  Does it 
need any modifications in order to trade weather derivatives under it?  I'm 
not sure if the standard ISDA works or if it  needs an amendment for special 
weather definitions.  I am assuming you are handling weather based on your 
handling the new weather/insurance/transformer stuff...if not, please pass 
along to whomever is handling.  Thanks so much for your help.

Because they are a governmental entity, in order to do financial our lawyers 
would need to talk to them about their authorizing statutes, legislative 
authority and possible legal opinions before they can trade financial.  So if 
they want to trade financial, get me a name and phone number, probably of one 
of their lawyers and we'll have to talk to them.

Notify them only when forms are completed (not as they might be evolving).  
Also, they should be using the swap forms in the attorney bank, so they need 
to know where they are located.

The attached confirm is a swap.  There is no need for a rep in the confirm.  
If a weather deal is structured as an option, Gordon Heaney (backed by Diane 
Anderson) who confirms weather transactions, adds the weather-specific Trade 
Option rep into the confirmation.  The desk uses a template for options.  Let 
me know if you have any other questions.  Sara

override the Masters where required. This is common practice OTC.
- 3(d): I don't understand why we are amending this.

Ed,

Please talk to Tana Jones and see if she can get the ball rolling to finalize 
the assignment amendment that is on Carol St.Clair's desk.  Basically, I 
spoke with Vangie last week, and we agreed to make the effective date of the 
assignment JUNE 12, 2000.  That's the last issue at hand.  Please have Tana 
(or other legal person) insert the date, get it executed accordingly, and fax 
a copy of the signature back to Vangie at Merchant.  Vangie's number is 
410-295-1719.  Please ask for her fax number if you don't have it or can't 
find it.  [ this assignment is what Christopher Smith worked on with 
Vangie...it pertains to gas and financial trades ]

FYI, last week Vangie forwarded to me the second assignment batch pertaining 
to power deals.  I'll look at this.

Tana,

Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the 
assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who 
previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and 
with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is 
working on this.

I've left Mark Taylor a message since Carol's voice mail forwards all 
questions to Mark.

Could you let me know if you have any info?

Thx,
Tracyh

Susan/Tana,

I'm getting hounded by Credit to move some deals booked with Phoenix Dominion 
Energy LLC over to Dominion Field Services, Inc..  Are either of you aware of 
an Assignment Agreement reflecting this change?  Let me know if it's okay to 
do this.

Thanks,

The Assignment and Amendment to the Assignment was faxed to Vangie McGilloway 
and the orginals are being fedexed to her tonight.  A copy is being sent to 
Tracy.We have received the executed Second Amendment to the ISDA Master Agreement 
dated as of July 31, 2000.  This amendment changes the Counterparty's 
exposure Threshold and exempts certain Transactions when calculating 
"Exposure" under Paragraph 3 of the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  Copies will

Attached is my list where I approved this initial counterparties.  
Whew...!!!  As you can see, I opened National Gypsum w/o restrictions.  I 
have a database where I keep track of my approvals, unfortunately, the 
computer people are really busy and can't add my drop downs for pulp and 
paper approvals until late this week/early next week.  After reviewing 
thousands of online counterparties, I can't keep track of what I'm telling 
people without my systems in place!

Attached is my list with the approvals from Legal filled in.  As I mentioned 
Friday, we will need to keep track of any trading restrictions on a going 
forward basis, because it might impact approval of new online pulp & paper 
products.  Two of the counterparties on this initial list fall into that 
category.  ConAgra Energy Services, Inc. cannot enter into option 
transactions.  We currently have none online, so it's not an issue, but if we 
add options, this would not be allowed.  Second, The E.W. Scripps Company is 
allowed to trade 48.8 gram newsprint only transactions.  We do not currently 
trade 48.8 gram newsprint.

My database will track this, so to add new products online, the counterparty 
should come back through as an amendment, so I can catch it.  Does this make 
sense to you?

I am currently working on the ClickPaper.com project and am responsible for

customers that were on our initial mailout and need to go thru the approval 
process soon.  However, below is a list of 4 customers that we need to focus

trades, therefore, I will need to immediately send them their user ids.  
Irving Pulp & Paper Limited
ConAgra Energy Services, Inc.
Inland Paperboard & Packaging, Inc.
Waste Management, Inc.

I appreciate your help in this matter.

With respect to he Bakersfield Californian on the list below, I am amending 
my original approval for this counterparty to approve them to enter into 
newsprint swaps and options only.  At this time our list does not reflect the 
individual products you are trading.  I understand from Mark Taylor that he 
spoke to Jeff Harbert last night about amending your excel spreadsheet to add 
the individual pulp and paper financial products, since restrictions such as 
this one will occur from time to time.

Attached is the referenced list.  The Bakersfield California is approved to 
only do newsprint commodity swaps and options.  Therefore, I have turned them 
down to trade the current products we have available online.  As our product 
base expands, we can send them through again as an amended counterparty if we 
offer newprint commodity swaps and options online.



At Mark Taylor's direction, I have revised the Bilateral Confidentiality 
Agreement form to add a new Paragraph 2 with respect to keeping the 
discussions confidential.  A copy is attached for your files.


Attached are the referenced lists.  A few things to note:

On the 8/7/00 List:

Papier Masson, LTEE can transact all pulp and papers swaps, but not options 
(when we have them).

On the 8/8/00 List:

Globe Building Materials, Inc. has been shut down from trading financial 
since they are currently not an eligible swap participant ("ESP") in their 
own right.  However, getting a letter of credit in place would make them an 
ESP, and Credit has requested a letter of credit from them.  As soon as they 
receive the LC, Credit will pass the counterparty through again for 
re-approval.

On the referenced list, Credit shows River Trading Company as an amended 
counterparty, but I didn't have them at all so I treated them like a new 
counterparty.

On the 8/8/00 List, Braintree is a division, and I would like it to read:  
City of Braintree, Massachusetts Electric Light Department.
the name on Spinnaker is wrong, Credit will be correcting it to read 
Spinnaker Exploration Company L.L.C.

I just wanted to confirm that your records show the referenced counterparty 
closed for power...?----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 08/09/2000 02:46 PM -----

Before I get legal and PR to look at this could you give me a bit more 
background on the potential arrangement with NextSet. I dont understand where 
the need for training will come in. 

I know that generally Enron has a policy of not being seen to endorse a 
client's products. PR may therefore have a problem with giving NextSet the 
ability to put our logo on their site. How important is this likely to be ?

In the future, if we have a city or a county come through, we need to 
identify the state they are located in as part of the counterparty name.  The 
City of Huntsville is an example where I took it to be the the City of 
Huntsville, TX, and, per my conversation with Tom today, it appears they are 
the City of Huntsville, AL.  This isn't going to be a problem with my 
financial approval, since I shut down all cities for financial unless we have 
a master in place, but it might be a problem for power.  The same would apply 
to counties.

So, if we get cities and counties in, let's try and make the state part of 
the counterparty name.

I do believe if I got just one more vote for the Chairman's Award this year, 
I just might double my tally of last year (one vote).  With such an increase 
in my voter approval rating I just make have a landslide victory this year!

The White House may become an option... I just got in from Aspen.  This Sunday looks good for me for Carol's 
birthday.  Is Holly going, she might like to...?

In terms of a townhome, I think that would be nice, also Garden Oaks.  It 
seems like you are kinda all over the place, though, and you might want to be 
careful making "emotional" home buying decisions...

As far as not hearing back from Enron.  I wouldn't think anything of it.  
They told me they absolutely wanted me and then I didn't hear back from them 
for two months.  Big companies have lots of layers to get anything done.  
Just keep plugging on...

Holly would be a good one to invite.  She and Carol are real good friends.

No response yet.  I have a call into Credit to discuss what entities we want 
to trade with.Mark Taylor asked me to respond to your request about the OMLX  software.  I 
spoke to Mark Elliott in our London office who dealt directly with the OMLX.  
He said to contact Susan Gill at the OMLX, who we spoke to on the agreements, 
and she should be able to direct you to their software people.  Her number in 
London is 011 44 171 815 8510.  Let me know if I can be of further service.We have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated

1.  What is the heading styed "Derivatives Trading"?  I think that should be 
"Credit Derivatives".

2.  Move "Gas Trading" and "Emerging Markets Trading" to the end of the list, 
since I never have any responses from those groups.

3.  I need you to fix the boxes where I click for approved, "yes", "yes, with 
limitations", or "no", so I can unclick them if I click them by mistake.

4.  Like we have the sort for Houston or London, I need a sort for 
"EnronOnline" and "ClickPaper".  I will maintain my approvals for each of 
those separate online trading databases in the same database.

5.  I need a new category for "Pulp & Paper Financial".

Can you get these done ASAP, since I am sure by now you have gotten your rush 
from last week done....

As usual, your help is always appreciated!Nella Cappalleto has early retired from the Calgary office.  In your 
distribution memos for signed documents, copies of Canadian agreements were 
previously sent to Nella.  Please send them to Peter Keohane's new assistant,

With respect to the attached list, a few things:

1.  With respect to Dynegy Power Marketing, my records reflect that they are 
approved for all products (including financial & power).  Can you let me know 
if your approvals reflect otherwise?

2.  With respect to Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company:  
Northern Illinois Gas Company should be restyled to be "Northern Illinois Gas 
Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company".  We have just received the executed ISDA 
Master with this entity and that is how the counterparty directed us to set 
the master up.  Nicor Gas Company appears to be their physical gas trading 
arm, so that entity name should be left alone.

I haven't forgotten the 8/11/00 list, I am waiting to hear back from 
Australia about a question.

Do you want to be on the distribution to see the daily Excel Spreadsheets 
when they have Japanese counterparties for approval?  For online, what I 
daily do is send my new counterparty lists to each of the relevant trading 
legal groups.  Each of the legal trading groups has one day to respond or I 
will consider their products approved for the counterparties on that day's 
list.  I have been giving the approvals for Japanese counterparties.  
Currently, I am approving them for all products (with the only restriction 
being on bandwidth, where they can only trade the US segment, which happens 
to be the only bandwidth products we have opened online so far!).   I 
understand that when we offer Japanese based products the approval process 
may get more complex.

Saying all that, do you want to be on the list for the daily approvals, or do 
you want me to continue to respond for Japan w/o running it by you? Can you put this on my calendar.  Thanks.

Good Morning Everyone,

The Swap Group will hold a Forms Meeting to discuss potential form changes to 
our financial trading forms on:

Date:  Thursday, August 17th

Time:  10:30 a.m.

Location: Conference Room   EB38C1

Each legal trading group here in Houston checks on a relevant counterparty's 
ability to trade its products.  So far the only physical trading area where a 
governmental counterparty appears to have problems is the power trading group 
where there are licensing requirements that may or may not have been obtained 
to trade power.  For financial trading we do have to inquire into the 
relevant governmental entities' authority to enter into derivative 
transactions.  In order to do that we look at statutory authority, any 
relevant local regulations, investment policities, etc., in addition to 
obtaining legal opinions on the subject, and with some counterparties hiring 
outside counsel to advise us.  For most governmental entities if we do not 
have an ISDA Master in place and have already done such due diligence, I will 
not be approving them to trade financial products.

As far as the financial test, for the US based counterparty list, I check 
with Credit on every counterparty to determine whether they meet the US 
eligible swap participant standards.  As I'm sure you know, for most plain 
vanilla corporates and partnerships this means having total assets of $10mm 
or a net worth of $1mm.  Pretty much, if I am turning down a counterparty to 
trade financial it will be because they do not meet the ESP test or they are 
a governmental or quasi-governmental entity.

If what you are telling me is that the Australian counterparties have to meet 
a $6mm asset test to trade any products, then I will add this to my daily 
inquiry to Credit and turn down Australian counterparties if they do not meet 
this test.  At your direction I will handle this in this manner.  How would 
you like me to proceed?

Is this an incorporated entity? I assume its authority to trade a range of 
products has been checked out? In Australia this assumption can not be made 
for government  entities

Under our licencing requirements we need to make reasonable enquiries that a 
counterparty has (or is guaranted by someone who has) atleast USD6 million in 
assets. Can this assumption be made?

Tauton is ok for all products, except for financial products (it can do 
power).  David, when I talk about this I am never including credit 
derivatives unless Credit specifically tells us in their spreadsheet that 
this is a credit derivatives counterparty.

Justin,

I approved Powercor to trade before I left last night.  By copy of this email 
to our online team here, I will be notifying them of your concern that this 
counterparty is opened to trade when you arrive at work today in Australia.

Thanks for waiting around this morning for David Minns. I'm not sure if you 
got to hear his message before you left however Powercor should now be good 
to go. I would really like to have them set up and trading by tomorrow 
morning Sydney time so I would appreciate it if you could send me the 
spreadsheet first chance you get.

Thanks for your help,

Justin

John,

Here is the list from yesterday.  On a going forward basis I will just add 
you to my distribution, and there will usually be no message from me unless 
we have a RUSH approval or some other info I need to communicate.

The online team called and they would like a rush approval for Duke Energy 
Merchants LLC.  In particular, this counterparty would like to trade European 
physical coal.  Please let me know as soon as possible whether you have any 
problems with this counterparty.Thanks to you and Scott for your help, I appreciate it!  I hope all is going 
well...I'm trying to get a copy of the agreement on the gas side to see what you've

David,

Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted 
into our Financial Trading Database.  This databse is the central master 
database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft 
form or that have been executed.  London currently updates this database to 
manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the 
Australian agreements plugged into the system.

This database serves a number of purposes.  First, it is our core memory of 
contract negotiations.  Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take 
a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with 
and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  It is critical as we become a 
global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take 
on these financial contracts.  For instance, it would be quite problematic if 
someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and 
asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in 
another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the 
same position the day before.  We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort 
on the counterparty front.

In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no 
way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.

Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside 
auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.

For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master 
agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place. 
Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract 
records and approval for online trading.

For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our 
Clients, whether traders or  back office support people.  Employees outside 
legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the 
confidential Legal and Credit comments.  They have no edit capabilities.  The 
database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have 
found helpful.

You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator 
requesting full edit access for you.  It usually takes a few days.  Once you 
get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can 
figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..

Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?  That would be a good 
time for me to do a full review of this database with you.  I heard back from the coal lawyers.  Duke is approved to trade all coal.Mark Taylor just heard that Edmund is very sick and has been out for quite 
awhile.  What's the scoop?  Is he in the hospital, will he continue to be 
out, is there someplace we can send flowers?  Can you let me know what's 
going on.  Thanks!Per my conversation with Frank, this counterparty wants to trade weather 
online.  However, they have the old style ERMS Master in place which only 
covers energy commodities.  I spoke to Scott Tackett on the Confirm Desk, and 
he is going to add language to the confirm that puts the trades under the 
master agreement.   I also spoke to Tanya Rohauer in Credit and she is going 
to move this counterparty up on the list for an ISDA replacement master.

So, they are OK to open for weather. Can you please have the Password Application amended to set up the 
counterparty as I have indicated.  Then tell Global Contracts it is done.

With respect to the attached list, a few things:

1.  With respect to Dynegy Power Marketing, my records reflect that they are 
approved for all products (including financial & power).  Can you let me know 
if your approvals reflect otherwise?

2.  With respect to Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company:  
Northern Illinois Gas Company should be restyled to be "Northern Illinois Gas 
Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company".  We have just received the executed ISDA 
Master with this entity and that is how the counterparty directed us to set 
the master up.  Nicor Gas Company appears to be their physical gas trading 
arm, so that entity name should be left alone.

I haven't forgotten the 8/11/00 list, I am waiting to hear back from 
Australia about a question.






Per Leslie Hansen, the name above is the way the Town of Braintree, 
Massachusetts is setting up their power contract, so this is the way we 
should open them up for EOL.I have already responded in my initial email.  For whatever reason, the 
counterparty trades physical gas as "Nicor Gas Company".  They trade 
financial as indicated below.    It is now up to EOL to get back with the 
counterparty and get them to amend the Password Applcation.

I haven't forgotten the 8/11/00 list, I am waiting to hear back from

We have received the First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated  as of 
July 1, 2000 ("Amendment").  This Amendment (1) amends Counterparty's 
Threshold under the Credit Suport Annex, (2) exempts certain Transactions 
when determining "Exposure" under the ISDA Master Agreement, and (3) changes 
the Fixed Price with respect to the "Exempt Transactions" reflected in the 
Amendment.

Copies will be distributed.There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading 
with these entities.

We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company 
d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not 
set up this way it need to be.

Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.

There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only 
trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.

The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under 
both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will 
resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical 
gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.

When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we 
want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the 
correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.

Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too.Keep me posted on what you find out from this corporate search company.  I'd 
be interested to see what prices we can work out.  I am also going to contact 
Kate Cole and see if she uses anyone special.  If Enron Corp. does and they 
have negotiated any special rates, maybe we can piggyback off of it.  I'll 
keep you posted.

		 Subject: Re: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas Company

Per my conversation with Nicor Gas Company's attorney, Northern Illinois Gas 
Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company. Therefore, Nicor Gas Company 
is the only entity that all the deals needs to be booked under. However, the 
attorney also agreed to the fact that they do use the name "Northern Illinois 
Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company" eversince the name change happened. He 
said they had been using both names "contractually" and interchangeably even 
though it is all just ONE company, one state registered company.

I'm currently waiting on name change documents, however this is what it looks 
like thats going to happen:
The main HQ company would end up being NICOR GAS COMPANY with all the 
trades/contracts/deals being merged into one record. However, if need be we 
could have a Tradename set up as "Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor 
Gas Company" since this is how the company does business as, in some cases.

Nicor's legal Dept could be reached at (630) 983-8676 for any further 
clarifications in this matter.

Subject: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas Company

There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading 
with these entities.

We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company 
d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not 
set up this way it need to be.

Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.

There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only 
trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.

The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under 
both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will 
resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical 
gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.

When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we 
want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the 
correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.

Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too.

OK, guys, based on Adnan's information from the counterparty, all contracts 
under Northern Illinois Gas Company will be changed (via name overlay) to 
Nicor Gas Company once Adnan has received the proper name change 
documentation.   Since no changes have been made in GCP to correct the HQ 
company and trade name relationships, the recent ISDA contract was set up 
under Nicor Gas Company.  Once these changes are made in GCP, the contract 
can be changed to the trade name if still needed at that time.

I apologize for all the confusion and hope this helps all parties concerned.

Thanks,

Subject: Financial Trading Legal Database

David,

Mark Taylor asked me to talk to you about getting your ISDA Masters inputted 
into our Financial Trading Database.  This databse is the central master 
database where we keep records of the financial agreements in either draft 
form or that have been executed.  London currently updates this database to 
manage  its (and Singapore's) financial contracts and I would like to get the 
Australian agreements plugged into the system.

This database serves a number of purposes.  First, it is our core memory of 
contract negotiations.  Anyone in Legal and Credit around the world can take 
a look at this database and determine who we have entered into contract with 
and what negotiation issues may be at issue.  It is critical as we become a 
global trading company that we are consistent in the legal positions we take 
on these financial contracts.  For instance, it would be quite problematic if 
someone in Houston was negotiating a contract with an ISDA counterparty and 
asserted that a certain position was critical, if we find out a lawyer in 
another office was negotiating with the same counterparty and gave on the 
same position the day before.  We need to make a somewhat coordinated effort 
on the counterparty front.

In addition, with so many masters and so many counterparties there is just no 
way to keep track of what we have said or done unless we have a database.

Further, we use the information in the database to respond to inside 
auditing, reporting and insurance inquiries.

For online trading, I check the database to see if we have a financial master 
agreement and what trading restrictions we may or may not have in place. 
Global contracts uses this database to confirm their financial contract 
records and approval for online trading.

For both Houston and London we use the database to communicate with our 
Clients, whether traders or  back office support people.  Employees outside 
legal have  limited view access only to see all the information except the 
confidential Legal and Credit comments.  They have no edit capabilities.  The 
database also has some reporting functions that we and London Legal have 
found helpful.

You should have gotten my email to Mike Neves, out database coordinator 
requesting full edit access for you.  It usually takes a few days.  Once you 
get access maybe you could find some time to surf the database, and we can 
figure out how to get your ISDA data inputted..

Are you coming to the ENA Legal Conference in October?  That would be a good 
time for me to do a full review of this database with you.  



Per the memo below, we are looking for European and Canadian corporate search 
companies, and it occurred to me that you may already have someone you use.  
Do you have any recommendations?  Thanks for your help!

On an ISDA I am reviewing, credit has asked that all indebtedness of the 
Canadian counterparty to its affiliates be subordinated to us (in this case 
ECC).  Does anyone have access to a Canadian form of subordination 
agreement?  I imagine that a fairly bare-bones form would suffice.  Thanks --

Enron North America's Annual Legal Conference is coming up quickly!   
This year's Conference is scheduled for Thursday, October 5th and Friday, 
October 6th at The Woodlands Resort & Conference Center.  The program will 
commence at approximately 1:00 p.m. on Thursday and conclude at approximately 
12:00 noon on Friday.  The agenda for this year's conference will be 
circulated shortly.

The Conference Center is located approximately 30 miles north of downtown 
Houston.  Maps will be circulated with the agenda.

We would like to get a headcount as soon as possible in order to complete 
planning for accommodations and transportation.  Attendees from outside 
Houston should make their own arrangements for travel to Houston. 

Please complete the attached RSVP form and return it to Linda Noske (EB3814), 
by fax at (713) 646-3490, or by e-mail at Linda.J.Noske@enron.com.


At Sara's request, attached is a draft of the blackline of the referenced 
master.
I'm helping Alan Aronowitz out with a presentation he has to give on the 
global energy markets and I was thinking that Paul recently did a 
presentation and maybe there might be some good slides on the European 
markets that I can pull in.  Can you locate, or find someone to locate, 
Paul's presentation, and email it to me.

I hope you get out of work at a decent hour today.  I bet you could use a 
beer with all the late nights you've been putting in.  How's the house going?

Susan Bailey, the paralegal working on this master, spoke to the Company 
after receiving these emails.  They faxed to her a copy of the assumed  name 
certificate wherein Northern Illinois Gas Company transacts business under 
the name Nicor Gas Company.  Per her conversations they have not changed 
their name, they are only operating under the assumed name Nicor Gas 
Company.  Being so, the online account would have to be renamed as Northern 
Illinois Gas company dba Nicor Gas Company.  Per my conversation with Stacy 
Dickson, a physical gas lawyer, they still transact physical gas under their 
master with Northern Illinois Gas Company.  I will have a copy of the assumed 
name certificate walked down to Adnan.  If we are all in agreement after 
this, it seems like we need two counterparty names "Northern Illinois Gas 
Company" and "Northern Illinois Gas Company dba Nicor Gas Company".  Upon 
receipt of the assumed name certificate, please confirm your agreement and I 
will contact Credit and the Online team.

OK, guys, based on Adnan's information from the counterparty, all contracts 
under Northern Illinois Gas Company will be changed (via name overlay) to 
Nicor Gas Company once Adnan has received the proper name change 
documentation.   Since no changes have been made in GCP to correct the HQ 
company and trade name relationships, the recent ISDA contract was set up 
under Nicor Gas Company.  Once these changes are made in GCP, the contract 
can be changed to the trade name if still needed at that time.

I apologize for all the confusion and hope this helps all parties concerned.

Thanks,
Stacey

Subject: Re: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas Company  

Per my conversation with Nicor Gas Company's attorney, Northern Illinois Gas 
Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company. Therefore, Nicor Gas Company 
is the only entity that all the deals needs to be booked under. However, the 
attorney also agreed to the fact that they do use the name "Northern Illinois 
Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company" eversince the name change happened. He 
said they had been using both names "contractually" and interchangeably even 
though it is all just ONE company, one state registered company.

I'm currently waiting on name change documents, however this is what it looks 
like thats going to happen:
The main HQ company would end up being NICOR GAS COMPANY with all the 
trades/contracts/deals being merged into one record. However, if need be we 
could have a Tradename set up as "Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor 
Gas Company" since this is how the company does business as, in some cases.

Nicor's legal Dept could be reached at (630) 983-8676 for any further 
clarifications in this matter.

Subject: Northern Illinois Gas Company/Nicor Gas Company

There appears to be confusion over who and what products we should be trading 
with these entities.

We have an ISDA Master Agreement in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company 
d/b/a Nicor Gas Company.  This is a new master.  If the counterparty is not 
set up this way it need to be.

Physical gas has a master in place with Northern Illinois Gas Company.

There is no master agreement in place with Nicor Gas Company and the only 
trading being done with this entity is online gas trading.

The issue that needs to be resolved is whether we want to trade gas under 
both Northern Illinois Gas Company and Nicor Gas Company.  Frank Davis will 
resolve this issue with Tom Moran in Credit and Stacy Dickson with physical 
gas Legal, and they will let us know who we should be trading with.

When we hear back from them we can finally resolve what counterparty names we 
want to set up and get back to the counterparty if we have not received the 
correct Password Application to match out intended trading partners.

Sorry for all the confusion this is causing.  I am confused too.

Leslie,

Theresa Mandola with EOL called and the referenced counterparty called her 
and is already trading gas with us and would like to start trading power 
online.  I looked in my database and we have them shut down for power.  Is 
this a counterparty we could open up for power or not?At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching a clean and blacklined 
draft of the Schedule and Credit Support Annex to the referenced ISDA Master 
Agreement.  Can you please provide or confirm the following information:  (1) 
since the Counterparty is Australian, I have added the Counterparty's ACN 
Number to the document.  Can you please provide that number to us.  (2) Can 
you take a look at the definition of "Obligors" in the Credit Support Annex 
and let us know if it references the correct Obligors under the Loan 
Agreement.

Since I will not be in the office this afternoon, can you please call Sara at 
(713) 853-5620 or Stephanie Panus at (713) 345-3249 with your comments.  
Thanks for your attention herewith.




Per my conversation with Leslie, it is OK to open this counterparty for all 
US physical power.

this a counterparty we could open up for power or not?You both may already by aware of this, but the online team has contacted me 
and it is their desire to have the Japanese & Australian products also 
offered out of the U.S. by Enron North America.  They would continue to be 
offered by their current companies, "Enron Australia" and "EnronJapan", but 
they want the products sold "24 hours a day" and I guess to do this they 
would be offered also by Enron North America.  Do you see any legal issues 
from your side with a your Japanese or Australia products being offered by 
Enron North America too?I can't say it enough...you are the best!

Mary:
Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product 
Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each 
Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper 
entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but 
please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry,
Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more 
like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be 
consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to 
include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the 
new form to credit.

Thanks for everyone's input.

Shari,

To save you some time in the future, if a counterparty says "declined" on the 
worksheet, you don't even have to look at it at all, because it means Credit 
has decided not to trade with them.

I am forwarding a copy of Leslie's email, as a sample for you.  I input 
Leslie's responses in my EOL Legal Database, so I can keep track, product by 
product, of what we said for a counterparty, and then our rationale behind 
it, in case we need to reconstruct why we said "no trading" at a later date.  
If it's an "amended" counterparty, she will tell be whether or not she is 
changing an earlier approval.  Further, I put Leslie's notes about any 
particular contract issue in the database, like "override letter", "online 
GTC", or whatever.  Again, it's our memory of what we approval, and I hope 
with thousands of approvals out there, I know I can't remember everthing.

It's time for our regular Friday evening email chat!  Hope your doing well.  
What's the scoop on your surgery?

I've got a few new products showing up on my list, originating from your neck 
of the woods.  Specifically, we've got MG metals out of Rotterday and Japan.  
Are there any legal issues for my Houston based customer list, or are they OK 
for everybody?There is no list for 8/21/00, since the only counterparty was a decline.  
I've got two metals products shut down on the above lists until I hear back 
from London.

I just got a phone call from Mike Garred, a commodity trader for New Power 
Company.  He said they were some Enron 50/50 JV.  Whatever he needs to trade 
with us, LC or whatever, he's rearing to go ASAP.  He is wondering where his 
application is in the online process.  He is very eager to trade power & 
gas.  His phone no. is 853-3399.  He said his email says he's not in, but 
leave him a message he's checking them regularly.  His Credit person is Steve 
Nolan, located in Connecticut at 203/531-0400.Per our discussion, I am attaching a sample form of ISDA Schedule and 
Paragraph 13.  They, of course, should be sent to the Counterparty with the 
ISDA Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex attached.

That job I passed on your resume to in our group, I checked, and they still 
haven't started interviewing people yet, since Barbara is on vacation 
dropping her daughter off at college.The wine tasting sounds great!   I haven't been to one in awhile.  It's 
always good to see Hollis too.  Keep me posted...

First,  Scott is having a wine tasting (Australian) this Wednesday at 
Galleria Ruggles.  I don't yet know the cost, but thought one or both of you 
might be interested in coming.  I am going this time, and I think Hollis is 
too.  Might be fun.  It is not a full dinner, just wines and appetizer type 
stuff.

Second;  Mark

Most Fridays I will need to pick up William from after care at school, 
requiring about a 5:30 departure for me.  Scott plans to oridnarily pick up 
every other day of the week.  If I have a big project etc. I will come back 
in with William.  However, I realize you generally want people available 
until 6 each day.  Hopefully, this will not cause too much trouble.  Mary
Louis,

The brother of the kids downstairs is renovating a house in the Heights and 
needs an electrician to rewire or do a new fuse box or something.  Do you 
think that your electrician would want to give them a bid on the job, or do 
you have someone else to recommend?  They hired someone, who has in effect, 
taken their money and run, and their house sits, unable to proceed on the 
rest of the renovation work, until they can get the electric work done.

Thanks.There's a reason why you earned the title of "Favorite Credit Person (after

Oh guru of all things Canadian...

I'm working on comments to an ISDA that Hydro-Quebec sent us for an 
affiliate, HQ Energy Services (U.S.) Inc., which is a Delaware corporation.  
Is there anything special about Hydro-Quebec being the Guarantor, or just the 
usual considerations having a governmental entity as the guarantor?

By the way, I hope you're coming up for the Legal Conference.  There are many 
problems at Enron that need our help in getting sorted out, those kinds of 
problems that lots of margaritas seem to bring out!  I'm counting on you!The question of the day is, do you have access to our Lotus Notes Database?I'll go for that picking up the cigarettes off the floor thing, it seemed 
somewhat unsanitary anyway.  But if you get so wimpy that you can't survive a

I am coming to the conference but I am wary of your influences. No drinking, 
and therefore no picking up cigarettes off the floor and smoking them, can be 
permitted.

I have not dealt directly with HQ my self in the past and I know we have 
entered into transactions with them ( I am not sure if we have done anyt 
derivatives) but I would be careful of HQ.  Not only is a HQ a governmental 
entity, I believe it is governed by Quebec civil law, with which us common 
lawers are not overly familiar.  Quebec counsel might be necessary.

Can you provide Melissa with a copy of the recent assignment we entered

Hello, for future notices Jeff Sorenson is not in my group and does not work 
with us.  They don't pass documents on to our group.  If their is a way that 
you all can tell if a particular document is related to power and can send me 
a copy if it is related to power that would be great.  There was an agreement 
with Puget Sound (an intermediate agreement until we get an ISDA signed) that 
was given to Jeff Sorenson's group and I never knew it existed.  Therefore I 
sent a confirm out incorrectly.  
Could you possibly ask one of the runners to bring me a copy of this 
assignment?  My location is 3116a.  I would appreciate it.  

Thanks alot,

I just had this conv. w/Mark and Marcus Nettleton today about parties acting

I am sorry that I was unable to meet you whilst you were in London and I 
guess we had some unfinished business with regard to the United Gas / 
Utilicorp Co-signature issue.

I have now found the e-mail that I had previously sent to Houston with regard 
to the inability of certain US entities, including Utilicorp, to issue a 
guarantee for overseas entities unless they obtain FERC and the state 
regulators approval beforehand.


United gas have now changed their name to Aquila Energy Ltd and are looking 
to expand in to power in the UK as well as gas and power throughout Europe. 
Therefore, I expect our level of business is likely to increase in the near 
future.

It is now even more important that we either obtain a guarantee from 
Utilicorp, or, ensure that if Utilicorp co- sign any agreement that it is 
enforceable.

I would be very grateful if you could 

a) confirm that it is not possible for Utilicorp (and for that matter 
Entergy) top parent  to issue a parent company guarantee without obtaining 
authorisation form various regulatory bodies. 

b) that obtaining the signature of an authorised officer of Utilicorp on each 
agreement (or master) is enforceable.

Please feel free to give me a call on 44 171 316 6755 if you would like to 
discuss further.

Many thanks

Subject: Re: Entergy  

Bill 

Many thanks.

You are correct, it does have something to do with the international 
operations only. 

The way Entergy explained the situation, there was some sort of Act 'The 1935 
Public Utility Holding Company Act -section 53 or 58 I believe -   which says 
that you have to be own adjacent utilities (adjacent States?) to be able to 
issue guarantees in respect of international operations (very strange!).

In other words, if the company owns utilities that are not in adjacent 
states, as is the case of 'Entergy', then the utility has to segregate their 
business between domestic and non domestic business, thus the domestic assets 
cannot be used as security / guarantee for the international assets.

Whilst I do not have any reason to doubt what Entergy say, I would like some 
confirmation that there is no way to by-pass this Act. Is there someone in 
legal Houston that you could run this by?

Appreciate your help.

Many thanks and regards

I am currently talking to Entergy Trading & Marketing Ltd in the UK with 
regard to both physical gas sales and financial power trades.

I have requested a Parent Company Guarantee from Entergy Corp but have been 
advised that this in not available due to regulatory reasons but they are 
prepared to provide a guarantee from Entergy Power Development Corp which 
holds their overseas generation assets.

Whilst the proposed guarantor has some degree of financial substance, it 
would only support restricted short term trades and as this entity is not 
rated, does not lend itself easily to MAC language in the contract.

I would be grateful if you could confirm whether there are such regulations 
that would prevent Entergy Corp from providing us with a guarantee to support 
this UK entity.

Many thanks

Raquel Guzman, the lawyer for the referenced counterparty called again, and 
she is going on vacation next week and wants to get that ETA finalized so 
they can start trading when she's out.  She seems to feel the way the ETA is 
written that they are responsible for all unauthorized use of the password, 
including hackers into the system, and wants the language limited to use 
caused by their fault or negligence.  Can you call her at 215/684-6630.

Who should we contact in order to obtain copies of the approved online GTC's 
for ClickPaper?
Per the emails below, it appears you are looking for the Legal and Privacy 
Statement.  Mark T. said Leslie just revised it for the online team.  Leslie 
is on vacation until the 9th, but I think attached below may be the latest 
draft.  It is located in her "Online" subdirectory, under "Phase 2".

Dale,

Alan Aronowitz gave me your name as someone to get in touch with who might 
have an electronic copy of the EOL registration documents.  As I explained in 
my voice mail today, CommodityLogic, an Enron company, is setting up a web 
site that will require users to register to use the site.  We were hoping to 
leverage the work that EOL has already done in this area.

If you have the legal documents and/or registration documents could you 
please forward them to me as soon as possible.  We want to add these things 
to our web site (after we change the text to fit our needs) which is going 
live Friday - so as far in advance as you can get them to us the better.  If 
you do not have the documents could you please let me know or forward this 
note (cc'ing me) to the person you think may have them.

Thanks for your help.

Todd

Ameren Energy, Inc. as agent (ASC)
(for and on behalf of Union Electric Company d/b/a Ameren UE, Ameren Energy 
Marketing Company, and Ameren Energy Generating Company)
Transmission remains with Ameren Services Company


With respect to the referenced List:
1.  Ameren Services Company-OK to shut down powe & SO2, as per Credit's 
direction
2.  Oglethorpe Power Corporation-they are specifically being opened to trade 
power, however, our records do not show them as having a FERC license.  If 
they really want to trade power we are going to need a name and phone # to 
contact them & get evidence of their FERC license.
3.  Ameren Energy, Inc.-we cannot currently open them up until we investigate 
more this agency thing.  It doesn't mean we're shutting them down forever, we 
just need more info.
I am going to have more names to give you from Argentina.  Actually, I need 
to give access to a number of people to different areas of the swap 
database.  I am in a seminar the rest of today, but when I get back I'll 
email you or give you a call about the access.I must have missed your promotion.  Congratulations!  Atttached is the

I originally had the referenced counterparty opened for power.  Are we sure 
it is not a FERC approved marketer?On the attached list, Alliant Energy Corporation is coming back thru to be 
opened for East power, and the power lawyers are telling me they don't have a 
FERC license.  If they really want to trade power I will need a name and 
phone number so our power lawyers can talk to them.
Then, I'll stick with what I told the EOL team.  If they really want to trade 
power they will have to get us a contact and we'll talk to them to see why 
they think they can trade power.  Otherwise, it stays as a "no".

Just a head's up.  Dave finally got the amendment to the ETA signed, so I am 
fedexing it out to the counterparty today.Per my conv. w/Sandy Steffen w/the referenced counterparty (ph:  
734/887--2048, fax: 734/887-2056):
POWER:  It appears they would like to trade many of the East Coast power 
contracts.  She isn't sure whether the Purchase and Sale Agreement they have 
in place with us would cover East Coast power, and whether it would cover 
firm and non-firm power.  Also, she was wondering whether we trade power 
transmission (I had no idea, silly me).  Further, even if we have a master in 
place with them, I don't know whether we would want to transact under it or 
under a GTC.  My records show they have come thru before through EOL and 
Legal shut down for power (Credit has them open). 
EMISSIONS:  They would also like to transact SO2, and want to get a master in 
place with  us.  I told her I would have one of the emissions lawyers talk to 
her (they are already open w/Legal & Credit to trade emissions).
MASTER USER CHANGE:  She already has a password set up with us and would like 
to change the master user.   When you're done with that agreement can you pass it back to me for the 
file.  Thanks.I keep trying to email them, but it won't go thru.  Maybe this time...

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of 
the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under 
an  ISDA Master Agreement.  We will need the standard executed copy.

 In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  Certificate of 
Incumbency.

 Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the 
documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
The ISDA Multicurrency Agreement Schedule has been approved and moved into 
the attorney forms bank.  It is located at o:legal\atty.fms\swaps\current

I've got them shut down for power.  They were one of the counterparty's on

I would like to clear up a confusing situation with Ameren which is currently 
taking place: 

On 8/29, Ameren Service Company ("ASC") they asked us to take them off EOL, 
apparently because they now want to trade in EOL under the name "Ameren 
Energy Inc. as agent". 

On 8/29, Legal said OK to taking ASC off EOL and said further that AEI's 
approval to trade on EOL was "on-hold" until Legal checked out the agency 
aspect. Despite this - AEI appears to have been trading on EOL since 8/16 and 
the confirmations we have been receiving back have been marked up by them. 
They are trying to change the name on the confirmations to AEI acting as 
agent for various entities.  I instructed Stephanie Sever yesterday to make 
sure that AEI either acting for itself OR acting as agent does not have 
access to EOL. This needs to stay the case until Legal directs otherwise. 

Just so everyone is aware, Leslie Hansen spoke with Ameren several weeks ago 
and told them that they would need to sign a special Consent Form as well as 
a modified ETA before AEI could act as an agent on EOL. The forms were 
emailed to them on 8/22 and to my knowledge, they have not been returned to 
us.  I have left messages for the Ameren's attorney to call me but she has 
not done so yet.  In any case, until they return the requested documents, 
they cannot trade on EOL. 

With regard to Ameren Service Company, today they appear to want to be back 
on EOL. That is fine so long as it is clear that they are doing so under the 
documentation that they signed originally. 

If anyone has questions, please call me on ext. 39477

Thank you,

Shari   Travis,

Are you shutting down their trading today?I am going to have to leave a skooch early on Friday, at 4 pm.I looked in our financial agreement database and ECTRIC does not have a 
master in place with either of those entities.  London Legal sent a draft to 
Credit Lyonnais in March of 1999, but there appears to be no activity under 
that master.  Credit Lyonnais has a master styled "Credit Lyonnais New York 
Branch (AAA Program) with Enron North America, under which we trade interest 
rate, currencies & equities, and Toronto Dominion has master in place with 
Enron North America and one with Enron Gas and Petrochemicals Trading 
Limited, an English corp., and a subsidiary of ECTRIC (however, I do not have 
a copy and do not know if this is a limited purpose master or not), but 
nothing for either of these entities under ECTRIC.  I hope this is helpful.  
Let me know if I can be of further service

Sorry about taking so long to get back to you on this.  Re:  sample master 
agreements...we recently had a group meeting where we were discouraged to 
send out sample masters.  What appears to be happening is that a customer 
gets a sample master w/no credit, and then when we finally send them a real 
master w/credit, they are somewhat hacked off because the end up being 
incredibly longer once credit is added.

If possible, can we not talk to Credit about sending them a real master?  Let

Per my conv. w/Sandy Steffen w/the referenced counterparty (ph:  
734/887--2048, fax: 734/887-2056):
POWER:  It appears they would like to trade many of the East Coast power 
contracts.  She isn't sure whether the Purchase and Sale Agreement they have 
in place with us would cover East Coast power, and whether it would cover 
firm and non-firm power.  Also, she was wondering whether we trade power 
transmission (I had no idea, silly me).  Further, even if we have a master in 
place with them, I don't know whether we would want to transact under it or 
under a GTC.  My records show they have come thru before through EOL and 
Legal shut down for power (Credit has them open). 
EMISSIONS:  They would also like to transact SO2, and want to get a master in 
place with  us.  I told her I would have one of the emissions lawyers talk to 
her (they are already open w/Legal & Credit to trade emissions).
MASTER USER CHANGE:  She already has a password set up with us and would like 
to change the master user.   Taffy, I just spoke to Marie and she needs a set.  Also, take Susan Flynn and 
Jason Peters off your distribution.

Does this apply only to the North American contracts and weather trades for

Does the instruction below apply to Australia and Japan ISDA's?

Subject: Online Weather Trading

Per my conversations with Mark Taylor, we should continue to put any weather 
trades done online under any relevant master agreement with the 
counterparty.  Further, there is no prohibition against doing a trade online 
with a counterparty when we do not have a master in place.  Any non-master 
trades would go under the respective GTC.  It appears to be only a 
coincidence that we are trading online only with counterparties we have 
masters in place with.



With respect to the referenced list, my instructions from power was to shut 
down Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Lower Colorado River Authority 
from both execute and view status for power.  With respect to Lower Colorado 
River Authority and bandwidth, I spoke to the Broadband team, and they 
haven't considered the governmental angle with respect to bandwidth, so they 
are running it by outside counsel (who happens to be in Singapore this week), 
and will get back to me.  So until I hear otherwise, I am shutting them down 
for bandwidth.

Tana-

I see that ENA is a contemplated counterparty for Japanese weather 
derivatives.  There are both legal and tax issues that require 
consideration.  

I am unsure if Susan Musch has had the opportunity to review the tax issues, 
therefore I have copied her on this note.

With regard to Japanese legal issues, there are certain matters that must be 
dealt with in the GTCs, if entering into transactions between ENA and 
Japanese counterparties are being considered, including issues of an 
underlying legitimate business purpose to avoid gambling restrictions etc.

Please inform me with whom I should be in contact to ensure that these issues 
are appropriately handled.

Thanks,

John

I am not in power any longer, but I would like to comment.  The creation of 
this contract is the most ridiculous waste of time.  How could you create a 
new contract when the existing contracts (PV and COB) should be shut down?

KJM
Just a reminder that if you change any of the resolutions contained in our 
Swap Resolutions Notebook, you need to update the Index, and substitute the 
revised resolutions into each of the Swap Group's persons Notebooks.  These 
would include for any of the trading companies, the resolutions that approve 
what we trade (which also includes who can sign the appropriate documents), 
as well as the brokerage approval resolutions.  It does not include the 
Confirmation signatories.Why, I do believe the three Tudor deals gets us to 451!

We have received an executed Master Agreement:


Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)

Effective Date:   May 31, 2000

Enron Entity:   Enron North America Corp.

Counterparty:   The Tudor BVI Global Portfolio LTD.

Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of:  Pulp 
and Paper








Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa...!

We were in the process of revising our form, so I just have to draft up an 
Canadian version of the sample ISDA master and get yoou a draft.  I'll try 
and get to it the next day or two.

Tana, I know we exchanged a couple of e-mails since the below about you 
providing to me the Canadian financial trading precedents described below, 
but I forget where it was left.  We do need to get these precedents to the 
counterparty as soon as possible and I apologize for not following up on it.  
As suggested, I need the actual base ISDA agreement, paragraph 13, credit 
support annex, etc. as well as the short form financial GTC but I do not need 
the municipal government schedule at this point.  Could you gather together 
these precedents and forward them directly to Chris Gaffney in Toronto?

Let me know if you need anything else from me.

Cheers

Greg

Subject: Canadian Precedent Form of ISDA

Tana, Enron Canada is currently negotiating a transaction with 6 major 
municipalities in Ontario (the "G6") to provide various services to a company 
those 6 entities are setting up, which services will include physical and 
financial trading (both gas and electricity).  John Suttle is working with 
Jan Wilson of our Toronto office to set the credit terms applicable to this 
entity on both the physical and financial trading side, but they have not yet 
made a final determination.  In the interim, the G6 has requested that we 
send them a copy of our precedent form of master financial trading agreement 
(both the ISDA and our short form financial GTC).  I assume you get requests 
like this all the time and was hoping that you could e-mail to me (i) the 
ISDA, credit support annex, Paragraph 13, etc. that we would typically put in 
place between ECC and a Canadian counterparty to financially trade gas and 
electricity in Canada (ie. incorporating the Canadian provisions), leaving 
the credit terms blank for the time being and (ii) the financial GTC we use 
for Canadian counterparties.

Call me if you have any questions or if there are any problems with preparing 
and forwarding these documents to the counterparty.

Thanks

Greg

I could not believe my ears when I heard from Ms. Heard that you are working 
covertly behind the scenes to ensure a Broadband win to the signed master 
competition.   I would think that Credit would have no biased interest in the 
outcome of this race.  Could such slanderous allegations be true?Upon further reflection of the undue influence you have attempted in the past 
and are currently attempting (need we forget you trying to get Bob Crane not 
to sign my agreements!), it seems like you have a lack of confidence in your 
abilities and are therefore unable to run a clean race!Per our conversation yesterday, we would like to open the "Other Agreements" 
information in the Financial Trading Agreement Database to members of the 
Interest Rate and Currency Desk.  If possible, we would also like them to see 
the comments screen.  The people who will need access are Laurel Adams, 
George Garcia, Sheila Glover, Kelly Templeton, Teresa Brogan.

As usual, we would like to get them access ASAP.  Can you keep me posted on 
their access.  Thanks!

Stephanie,

Recently, Enron has introduced a new product, US Power Financial Swaps in New 
York.  I noticed customers are not transacting often on those products and I 
believe it is due to financials not being open to trade with a number of 
companies.  Below I have listed  key customers that need to have this option 
to trade.

American Electric Power Service Corporation
Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc
Florida Power & Light Company
HQ Energy Services (U.S.) Inc.
New York State Electric & Gas Corporation
Select Energy, Inc.
Ontario Power Generation Inc.
Sithe Power Marketing Inc.
Allegheny Energy, Inc.

Please open these companies if they can trade financials online.  Keep me 
posted on the status.

Thank you very much for your time.

Joe,

I got a call from the Coral people that a corrected confirm had already been 
sent to them PRIOR to us getting them to sign the consent to assignment of 
the trade.  I'm sure whoever prepared it on the confirm desk didn't know I 
was working on this, but I told the Coral people I still needed the 
assignment back signed to keep our paperwork straight.  Even tho I hate to 
have to do the additional work, with these EOL trades, there is no "oops" 
trade.  Once we enter into the trade with 1 entity of a counterparty, we 
cannot just "move" the trade.  We need the consent of the assignor and 
assignee so there is not question later on down the line that the trade was 
not legally moved.   If eveyone on your team is not aware of this, can you 
mention it at your next group meeting...thanks!

I'm working on my backlog of lists.  I thought I'd send thru a few so you 
could get started.


HS Energy Services is relying on a parent guaranty to be able to meet the ESP 
criteria.  It does not meet the financial test on its own.  However, we have 
approved them to trade financial and have an ISDA Master in place.  Should I 
shut them down for the Australia products?

On the 9/11/00 list, Credit wants to open Ontario Power to trade financial 
power, but I cannot until we speak to Canadian outside counsel.  They are 
part of the split up of Ontario Hydro, which was the Province of Ontario, and 
obviously, a governmental, before the split up.  They are still a wholly 
owned sub of a governmental and we cannot open them up until we talk to 
outside counsel about the governmental issues.  I have a call into Canadian 
counsel right now.

Also, on the 9/8/00 list, Sempra Energy Solution called me to find out when 
they could trade, so if you could open them up pronto...


I'm working with Mike Corbally's office to get the missing information on 
Reporting Service, Reporting Agency and Datasource for the European based 
weather confirmations.  As soon as I have that information available, I will 
plug it into the confirms and email the confirms to you.

Mark Taylor said someone there in London Legal was working on a list of 
approved jurisdictions for derivatives.  Is it ready yet?  Can I get a copy 
of it?  I need it to continue my work on the approved counterparty list.

I know you prepared the Grupo Calidra Deemed ISDA, so thought you should see

Everyone,

The current value of existing fmtm is ($3.2MM).  Fred and this customer have 
had a falling out and the customer has decided to unwind his position and 
take his business elsewhere.  Because of this, an opposite trade was entered 
into that exactly reciprocated like terms.  This trade has not yet been 
confirmed and is currently pending credit.  As a cost of agreeing to do this, 
the customer was to provide $5.25/bbl on the remaining 92,000 barrels.  This 
amount totals $483,000 which, in the normal course of doing business, is owed 
and due as of tommorrow, September 13.  Fred and his customer, while I was 
listening on a taped line, agreed to structure settlement of trade NY9319 as 
such:

Amounts to be paid;

$483,000 Premium Payment Owed and Due
$192,375 Amount ENA owes this customer for Sept financial settlement - being 
withheld and netted against the $483M
$290,625 net amount to be financed until final payment is made on September 
30.
$1,353  amount of interest on the principal, using interest rate of 10%, 17 
days of tenor
$291,978 exact amount to be paid on September 30

Please structure the above referenced terms into appropriate language for the

Per instructions from Davis Minns in Australia, I have to shut down HS Energy 
Services from trading Australian power (not that they are going to!).  I am 
attaching an amended spreadsheet.
Attached is a resend of the Deemed ISDA that Stepahnie sent to Diane Anderson 
9n 8/13/00.


Attached is the proposed draft of the ISDA.  I think two substantive issues 
we are going out with are adding arbitration and not deleting "Affiliates" 
from the setoff section (which we agreed to in the original).  With all the 
bankruptcies going on right now Carol feels that we should at least make a 
stab at keeping Affiliates in.

Let me know if the draft is OK to send out.

I thought I might try to sum up.  It seems to me that we both need to 
finalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that 
we all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of 
next week.

1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap 
structure including the credit and covenant package.

2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have 
one prepared.  Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global 
Finance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its 
external counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements, 
documents, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or 
exchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among 
each other and we are therefore working at cross purposes.  Frankly, unless 
and until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and 
financial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations 
are, it is difficult if not  impossible to prepare documentation.  For 
example:

 (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee 
they were expecting from Enron Corp.  I was trying to require the Bank to 
accept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking 
for a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and 
warranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities.  Based upon 
this disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may 
have a problem to resolve.  However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by 
voice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a 
long form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact 
been provided (by whom I'm not sure) to the Bank.

 (b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the 
Enron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law.  However, I 
now understand there may be some agreement (by whom I'm not sure) to have the 
Enron Corp. Guarantee governed by New York law.

 (c) In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of 
enforceability opinion from Enron Corp.'s outside legal counsel with respect 
to the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron 
Corp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect 
to the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas/New York) being enforceable.

 (d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to 
me that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to 
Enron Canada.  Blake, Cassels & Graydon is prepared to provide those legal 
opinions.

 (e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of 
the underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine.  I 
suggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable.

 (f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the 
Bank's external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of 
Swapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed.

 (g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this 
afternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank.  This 
presents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps 
involving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults.  At 
the same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be 
capable of being set-off.  We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation 
through broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements.

 (h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on 
the credit/collateralization/margin requirements, which I think is dependent 
upon a final understanding of the swap structure.

 (i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not 
clear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap 
structure.  Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the 
principal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate 
"fee letter" to recover its fees.  More problematically, the Bank was not 
clear as to how "increased costs" would be accounted for in the swap 
structure.  Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions 
that if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a 
change in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those 
increased costs are flowed through.  They were not sure how this could be 
accommodated in a swap structure.  I suggested that there may be some way to 
fix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes 
or through a separate indemnification in the "fee letter".

 (j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the 
paper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank.  For 
example, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements 
and related documentation (which I believe Mark T's group will prepare in 
Houston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I've indicated above seems to have 
already been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs 
to be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels & 
Graydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the 
Bank in connection with the transaction.  Of course this depends on 
finalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants 
package.  In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, 
that the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same 
as the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank 
of Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper 
as soon as possible.  Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon 
as possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning.

Frankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a 
measure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external 
expectations.  It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all 
relevant groups (i.e. Legal/Global Finance/Credit/Origination) on Monday 
morning.

Regards,
PeterClem called wanting to speak to someone about the guaranty issue.  Who should

already been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs 
to be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels & 
Graydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the 
Bank in connection with the transaction.  Of course this depends on 
finalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants 
package.  In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, 
that the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same 
as the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank 
of Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper 
as soon as possible.  Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon 
as possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning.

Frankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a 
measure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external 
expectations.  It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all 
relevant groups (i.e. Legal/Global Finance/Credit/Origination) on Monday 
morning.

Regards,
PeterPer our conversation, attached is the form of confirmation we use when we 
adopt by reference the preprinted form of ISDA Agreement into a form of 
confirmation.
Fred wanted to get this draft out today, so I had to get it back from Mary 
and get Robert Bruce to review it, then sent it out.At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am enclosing a redlined draft of the 
guaranty.   Please let me (713/853-3399) or Sara (713/853-5620) know if this 
change meets with your approval.  Further, I am in the process of drafting 
the Enron Corp. Guaranty with respect to ECT Investments, Inc. and hope to 
have it to you shortly. 

 Attached is termination revised with Mary's changes.  Per Mary's conv. 
w/Fred, if the Counterparty failed to make payments hereunder, the contract 
would not be void ab initio, but instead, any payments to the counterparty 
would be offset against any amounts owing to us.

Mike,

Jason Peters, who was a lawyer seconded with us from Andrews & Kurth, has now 
gone back to A&K, but is still doing some work for us.  Is there some way for 
us to get him access to the Financial Trading Agreement database?  He is a 
lawyer, and is bound by client confidentiality with respect to all the 
information in the database, so I don't think we need to worry about granting 
him security access.  Can we get him access?

There are only two ways that I can think of that would allow him to access 
the Financial Trading Agreements information if he is no longer with Enron:

1.) if A&K uses Notes and has been granted a connection to our network and 
are cross-certified to access the ecthou_ln1 server
2.) Jason has a desktop/laptop with Terminal Server Account access to our 
network and he continues to maintain an Enron NT account and Notes ID (or 
Cross-Certified A&K Notes ID).

Please keep in mind, my Notes administration knowledge is a bit rusty and 
limited, but I'm pretty sure that this is the way it would have to work.  In 
any case, remote access in this capacity should be coordinated through 
Information Risk Management/Notes Administration.    I'm sure this is not 
very clear, maybe you can call me and we can discuss.

tm I need the following 3 files 1st thing:

Wabash Valley Power Association, Inc.
Ontario Power Generation
Royal Bank of Canada/Enron Canada Corp.

Thanks!Online would like to open this counterparty immediately for trading.  Can you 
let me know ASAP whether you have any legal issues with them.  Thanks.Per our conv. earlier, attached is our standard form of Enron Corp. Guaranty.
The revised form of ISDA exhibit.doc (which contains the credit support annex 
and letter of credit forms) has been moved into the attorney forms bank under 
atty.fms/current forms/isdaexh.doc.  The old form of ISDAexh.doc is now under 
"old forms" in the attorney forms bank as atty.fms/old forms/oldISDAexh.doc.  
Again, per my last email, the revised Multicurrency Schedule is already in 
attorney forms.  You may want to circulate blacklined drafts.  The Index to 
the swap forms is now also located in the attorney forms bank for your 
reference for the most current forms.  It is called "formlist.doc."

London and Singapore, FYI, in addition to making changes to the ISDA 
collateral annex, we made changes to the MAC definitions (which we inserted 
into ISDAexh.doc for ease of the paralegals) and made changes to the letter 
of credit terms, as well as the form of Letter of Credit.   We also added in 
an alternative "Credit Support Amount" provision on the front page of the 
ISDA credit support annex to deal with situations when we do not want to 
return the Credit Support Amount during the term of the Master Agreement.

We moved the guaranty forms (Enron Corp. and Counterparty) as a separate 
document(s) in the attorney forms bank, atty.fms/current forms/guaranty.doc.  
The guaranty form was revised to (1) make it cover both confirms and masters 
so we don't need two separate forms on an ongoing basis, and (2) we changed 
the procedures for timing of demands made on Enron (deleting the 15 day 
period).  We are also discussing adding an assignment provision to the Enron 
Corp. guaranty with Clement and will keep you posted.

We are close to finalizing changes to the Industrial Master, as well as 
making changes to the Omnibus form of confirmation.
Also, by the end of the day I will have moved our standard forms of 
Secretary's Certificates into the attorney forms bank.The above counterparty is approved to trade all products.Attached are the two ISDA's.


We have been pressured by the online team to open up all counterparties to 
trade financial unless we have a LEGAL reason not to trade with them.  With 
both those counterparties, you are correct, it is the companies' intention 
and direction that we trade financial with those entities, but still for 
online I have to say "yes" unless I have a "legal" reason to say "no".

All of the counterparties on today's list are ESP's, so I will approve them 
for all financial products.  If the aren't ESP's I would not approve them for 
financial products including Australian financial products.  Further, if they 
cannot meet the ESP test on their own, i.e., they are relying on a parent 
guaranty or a letter of credit to make them an ESP, I would approve them for 
all financial products, except Australian power (but they could trade weather 
per our earlier emails).

I'm having a little online brain drain today...am I correct in my thinking 
that all these "spreads" are financial...?Can you provide Stephanie Sever with the Online team view access to the 
referenced database.  Can you let us know when the access has been granted.  
Thanks!This list is all amended counterparties, most of them being opened up for 
financial power.  My records reflect that all of them were already open for 
financial products, except the three I have marked.  If you run across any 
others that you show as not being open for financial, let me know, because 
all of the counterparties on this list are ok for financial.
Also, on this list, my records reflect that Superior Natural Gas Corporation 
was shut down for physical power.  If you records do not reflect the same, 
can you shut them down...thanks!

Peter,

We revised the incumbency certificates for our U.S. master swap agreements to 
include the authority of the officer as well as the officer's incumbency.

I made the same changes to the Canadian form, but don't want to make any 
final changes to the Canadian form without your approval.  When you get a 
minute can you take a look at it and see if the change meets with your 
approval.

Nella, I am enclosing the current form of certificate as well as the revised 
one (which is #1 documents below).  Can you print them out for Peter.

Thanks!

  I don't know about you, but I LOVE lists with only one counterparty to 
approve, how about you?!!
I have a database where I maintain my online approval, and my the basis for 
my approvals/declines.  If you want to review counterparties we have 
previously approved/disapproved and why, or want to go in and to see what I 
approved on a specific counterparty, this would be the place to go.  Would 
you like me to get you access?Well, I do believe this makes 450!  A nice round number if I do say so myself!

We have received a proposed assignment from PPL Corporation to PPL Energy

Hi Mike!
A parent guaranty is no problem.  I'm attaching a copy, so you know what it
looks like.
We have a standard "long form" confirm ourselves, that is used until an
ISDA is signed.  I attached a draft below so you could see it as well.
We typically send these standard confirms to all our customers, so it may
expedite things if NYPA doesn't have any aversion to this confirm.  What
are your typical procedures? Would you accept our confirm, or should I go
head and get our documentation people to get started looking over yours?
Was the annual report on the web site sufficient, or would you like me to
Fed-Ex one? Let me know what else can do.

Hi Mike!
Our legal/documentations department tells me that we started putting
together an ISDA with NYPA over a year ago, but never completed it.  What
we need prior to any deals being executed is a legal opinion that contracts
are enforcable and statutory authority (I suppose this is compliments of
Orange County).  Can I have our documents person call you...or is someone
else there more appropriate

Rick, could you please let me know how I need to set up the execution lines 
on the two ISDA Master agreements for RBC and Bow Valley.  Does the bank 
require two signature lines?  What is the wording you need for Bow Valley's 
execution line (I assume it will be something like "Bow Valley Trust, by its 
duly appointed Trustee, X"?

Can you let me know as soon as possible so that I can have the standard forms 
of the actual ISDA agreement and Credit Support Annex prepared for execution 
tomorrow.  For logistics, can you also let me know whether the people who 
will be executing the documents on behalf of RBC and Bow Valley in Calgary or 
Toronto.

At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching our current from of ISDA 
Schedule for governmental entities and our sample form of legal opinion for 
such entities.  With respect to NYPA, we do have a copy of an authorization 
to hedge approved by the Board of Trustees of NYPA that they faxed us a year 
ago and I will fax a copy of it over to you shortly.


We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 8/23/00 amending the 
Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced Counterparty.  Copies will 
be distributed.FUNB sits stalled on my desk waiting for me to have time to work on it.  We 
are in the miiddle of a rush with Financial Power counterparties in need 
immediate assistance (many of them govt'ls which are demanding my attention) 
and structured financing w/swaps in the middle and I'm just putting out 
fires.  That master is really not a priority at all for ENA, and it is only 
Enron.Credit.com wanting to mirror it that is giving it any priority.  What 
is your proposed timing for a deal on that one?

Tanna,

Thanks for your help on the Goldman Sachs and Deutsche negotiations.  If you
could keep me posted on the timing of the Deutsche agreements being put in
place that would be really helpful.  I also have another quick request and
that relates to the ISDA Master Agreement with FUNB.  I have spoken to
Delene Travella at FUNB.  They are negotiating an ECTRIC Schedule with you
in Houston which they want to finalise before commencing EnronCredit.com's
negotiation.  Can you give me an update on where this negotiation stands and
how long before it is likely to be finalised?

Many thanks,

Clare Godson

The one I have is the blue (deep purple) flower.  I think it is a new color.

It has a little light orange fruit on it, hence the name 'Golden Dewdrop'.

It is not really a big deal if you don't want it.  I was just offering it to
you first because it is a neat plant.

Per my conversation this morning with the lawyer at NYPA, they would like to 
transact business on a going forward basis under the attached form of what we 
consider an "ISDA Confirmation" (it seemed to me their lawyer thought this 
document was a sufficient ISDA Master).  Sara has a call into him to get his 
thoughts about this document  Per my conversations w/Sara, we would like to 
get our standard governmental form of ISDA Master in place.  We wonder what 
your thoughts are on his document.  Further, he seemed quite firm that they 
would not be issuing a legal opinion, but would give us a certified copy of 
the resolution I am about to fax to you.   We look forward to getting your 
comments.

I was a little dismayed after our lunch when you disclosed the number of 
broadband masters potentially close to signature. However, I was a little 
cheered up when I got back and checked with the Swap Group and found out we 
have 13 masters out for signatures right now.  It still may be hard to beat 
you at your going rate...but, all I have to say is we're still in the 
game...GO TEAM!!!FYI,

I will be preparing this assignment for signature.

read access.
2.  Public Service Electric & Gas Co. - My notes show I already opened them

On the list for 9/21/00:  I am OK for shutting Aquila Energy Marketing 
Corporation down for financial, since they are now trading financial out of 
Utilicorp.  However, I didn't want to put "X's" in all those darn boxes, so I 
hope by my note only it will do the job.  I am also preparing an assignment 
of the online trades that I will send to the Confirm Desk when it is executed.

  Per your request, attached is the form of Duke Capital Corporation Guaranty.

Hi Tana,

I know that you are expecting to get back to me next Wednesday but our
traders faced credit issues with Enron today and they asked me to push
forward the process of getting all agreements in place as soon as. Thus, I
am sending you a draft of a restated and amended guaranty agreement hoping
that this will help to speed up the process. I will call you on Monday.

Attached are revised commodity swap confirms.  I didn't change the rate swap 
and we're still waiting for input from the bank.

At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am enclosing clean and blacklined drafts 
of each of the Bow River Trust and Royal Bank of Canada ISDA Schedules.

 

 Leslie Hansen asked me to forward to you our draft list of Legal contacts for 
online trading issues, and see if there is anyone you deal with on a regular 
basis that I may not know of that we need to add to the list.  
I hope you're OK?!   You probably don't remember (especially after getting

Hi tana

We have recently negotiated and signed an Isda with Barclays Bank ,(ECTRIC 
being the Enron Entity) which included some additional clauses in the 
Schedule( regarding Enron online trading) which Barclays want to include in 
the already existing ISDA  between ENA and Barclays. The details and The

look at this  wording.The clauses are identical to those that we have argeed

Subject: Barclays Guarantee and requested Amendment Agreement

 Hi  Justin,

Just to let you know the Guarantee arrived from Houston this morning. I have 
sent it on to Leigh. Also she requested that we amend the other Existing ISDA 
Master Agreement Barclays has with Enron North America, dated 13 Jan 1994 to 
include the Part 5(h) and(o)  wording dealing with  Procedures for entering 
into Transactions(Online and others), and also the Part 6 wording dealing 
with Additional Provisions for Commodity Derivatives Transactions.

I attatch her proposed amendment agreement. The wording of the clauses is 
identical to that which was agreed in the ECTRIC  Master that has just been 
signed, although the numbering of Part 5 (o) differs in the recent Isda with 
ECTRIC. Barclays cannot trade with ENA until the Isda has been amended.  Are 
we able to accommodate the   agreement?

Just a note to let you know that per my conversation with Tanya, after review 
by Brent, today I will be sending out am amendment to BMO allowing for the 
provision of Cash as Eligible Collateral under the ISDA.  When we get this in 
signed I will send my usual email out to the world explaining this amendment, 
but you may want to think about what procedures you will need to put in place 
to make sure this happens EVERY time we take collateral in (not to mention, 
we will also have to pay Canadian counsel to file releases as well , and this 
will cost us money too!  We don't want to have to do this too often.)  
Anything you want to tell me before I send this out today?!The execution documents were sent over to Duke Energy yesterday.  I spoke to 
them this morning and they we going to forward the documents internally for 
signature.  I, or Marie upon her return from vacation, will keep you posted 
on the progress of execution.Yes, except for weather, the financial GTC's are designed to cover all energy

Tana,

Enron Canada Corp. will be offering a Canadian power financial swap on EOL 
within the next couple of weeks.  Can you confirm that the current EOL 
financial GTC is sufficient for power trades.

Thanks!

We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated August 23, 2000 amending 
the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  Copies 
will be distributed to Frank Davis and to Peter Keohane for the Enron Canada 
Talisman file. Per our conversation, attached is the proposed form of amendment to the ISDA 
Master to provide for cash collateral under the Credit Support Annex.  Please 
call me at 713/853-3399 or Tanya Rohauer in our Credit Department at 
713/853-3263 if you have any comments or questions.
Per our conversation, the above counterparty is approved by Legal to trade 
online physical pulp & paper only.  We cannot trade financial until Credit 
receives financial statements and can determine whether they are an eligible 
swap participant or not.Chris,

Per our conversation, I am attaching  a sample form of ISDA for both a 
Canadian corporate and a Canadian governmental.  With the governmental, the 
proposed form of legal opinion attached to the ISDA Schedule would have to be 
modified depending on your particular situtation (see footnotes in opinion).  
As I also mentioned, we are making some revisions to the guaranty we are 
getting from Hydro-Quebec in response to comments from counsel, and we may 
want to make some of the same changes to guarantees we receive from any 
governmental guarantor.  If you end up having a governmental guarantor, let 
me know and I'll send you down the revisions.

By copy of this email to Joe Hunter on the Confirmation Desk, I am asking him 
to email you copies of the form of Omnibus Confirmation and Annex A thereto 
for an ECC/Canadian Counterparty Deal.  I have to say that if you end up 
transacting with a governmental entity, our form of confirmation will not 
include the reps and warranties required to transact with such 
counterparties, since we never trade financial with governmentals prior to 
execution of a master.  If you go down that road we may have to come up with 
some kind of form, but the best route is to get the ISDA in place first.

 
The bottom of this email will explain my email to Gaffer.

Tana, I know we exchanged a couple of e-mails since the below about you 
providing to me the Canadian financial trading precedents described below, 
but I forget where it was left.  We do need to get these precedents to the 
counterparty as soon as possible and I apologize for not following up on it.  
As suggested, I need the actual base ISDA agreement, paragraph 13, credit 
support annex, etc. as well as the short form financial GTC but I do not need 
the municipal government schedule at this point.  Could you gather together 
these precedents and forward them directly to Chris Gaffney in Toronto?

Let me know if you need anything else from me.

Subject: Canadian Precedent Form of ISDA

Tana, Enron Canada is currently negotiating a transaction with 6 major 
municipalities in Ontario (the "G6") to provide various services to a company 
those 6 entities are setting up, which services will include physical and 
financial trading (both gas and electricity).  John Suttle is working with 
Jan Wilson of our Toronto office to set the credit terms applicable to this 
entity on both the physical and financial trading side, but they have not yet 
made a final determination.  In the interim, the G6 has requested that we 
send them a copy of our precedent form of master financial trading agreement 
(both the ISDA and our short form financial GTC).  I assume you get requests 
like this all the time and was hoping that you could e-mail to me (i) the 
ISDA, credit support annex, Paragraph 13, etc. that we would typically put in 
place between ECC and a Canadian counterparty to financially trade gas and 
electricity in Canada (ie. incorporating the Canadian provisions), leaving 
the credit terms blank for the time being and (ii) the financial GTC we use 
for Canadian counterparties.

Call me if you have any questions or if there are any problems with preparing 
and forwarding these documents to the counterparty.

Thanks

Greg

Local Currency ISDA form.  I gave that redraft to Mary to sign off on the

Samantha,
Tana,

I have attached an amended credit worksheet for the referenced counterparty.  
This amended worksheet includes a Guaranty from its parent company of $5MM, 
thus increasing the collateral threshold to $5MM, and amending other credit 
covenants.

Per the Legal Comment in the Master Swap Lotus Notes Database, Tana received 
a call from the counterparty requesting a 'less complicated' agreement.  In 
the comment, Tana suggested using an Industrial Master, if this agreement is 
OK from a Legal standpoint, I am OK using the Industrial from a Credit 
standpoint.  

Please draft this amended credit worksheet to an amended Industrial Master.  

Thank you,

Russell

E:mail:  Susan.Bailey@enron.comIt appears that we have now opened up our first Japan based financial product 
on EnronOnline, and I need to get some direction from you as to what 
restrictions, if any, we have on (1) counterparties located/incorporated in 
Japan trading Japan based financial products, and (2) counterparties not 
located in Japan trading Japan based financial products.

Previously, the only Japanese financial product we had was weather, but it 
wasn't being sold by a Japan based Enron company, so my understanding was 
that I didn't have any particular restrictions under Japanese law for 
counterparties located in or outside Japan in trading this product.  Now that 
the product is being sold by a Japan based company I am wondering was 
restrictions I might have to keep in mind when doing my daily online 
approvals.

The only are Japan based direction I am getting is from the Broadband legal 
team (Robbi Rossi) which have told me Japanese counterparties can only trade 
US bandwidth segments.

P.S. we do have a Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list.Thanks, I appreciate it!  What should I do with the Japanese counterparty on 
the 9/26/00 list?  Shut them down for all trading on Japan based products 
until I hear from you?  Will you be coming to the Legal Conference here in

We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated 9/12/00 which amends the 
ETA to provide that Ameren Energy, Inc. can act as authorized agent for and 
on behalf of the following entities ("Operating Companies") under such ETA:

1.  Union Electric Company (d/b/a Ameren UE)
2.  Ameren Energy Generating Company
3.  Ameren Energy Marketing Company

The amendment to the ETA makes additional changes with respect to the agency 
relationship between Ameren Energy, Inc. and the Operating Companies.

In connection with such amendment to the ETA we have also received:

1.  The originally executed Password Application 
2.  Consent and Acknowledgement executed by the Operating Companies with 
respect to such agency relationship

Copies will be distributed.Julian,

The "Confirmation" will be the actual written Confirmation, which confirms in 
writing the terms of the deal agreed to on the phone.  I don't know if what 
they're looking for is a form of Confirmation (not deal specific) of what a 
Confirmation might look like if they did a trade, or if you actually have 
done or are proposing a particular trade and need to see the Confirmation 
filled in with the proposed deal terms.  I left Roni Cappadonna with Duke a 
voicemail asking her which specifically she was looking for.  As soon as I 
hear from her I'll get her what she needs.  If you have any more questions, 
email me back, or call.  I'm at your service!In don't know anything about this, do you?

Effective Date:   May 11, 2000

Enron Entity:   Enron North America Corp. 


Counterparty:   Small Ventures USA, LLC

Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of: Pulp 
& Paper
          Foreign Exchange

Confirming Entity:  Enron North America Corp.








Is anyone working on a confirmation for the Argentina office for a swap 
between ECT and Duke Energy International out of Argentina, Don Black would 
be the business person on this.  If you know, I need to get the draft faxed 
ASAP to Duke here in Houston.Per an email from Soma yesterday, Brian Hull wanted to transact out of their 
Toronto Branch, so I used their Toronto address in the agreement.  We do not 
have "transactions numbers" on our ISDA's.  I would take it if things proceed 
today, that we will date the agreement as of today, so the date of the 
agreement will be the only identifying information.  Toronto-Dominion will 
need to look at the notice information I put in the agreement and confirm 
that it is acceptable.  I pulled it from a recent agreeement they sent us.

As per my voicemail, attached are the officer's certificates we will require.

Do you know what address TD Bank will be using on the ISDAs?  (presumably 
their Calgary Main Branch)  also, are there transaction numbers for each of 
the ISDAs yet so that we can fill in the blanks on the certificate and 
opinions (RE ISDA Agreement Master No. ?)

Thanks

Dear All

This is just a quick note to let you know that I will be leaving Enron next 
Friday to return to New Zealand in order to enjoy an extra summer and to 
study a bit more law.

I'll be around until Friday 6th August should you have anything specific you 
would like me to deal with, but Michael Slade will now be dealing with all of 
my files. Michael has joined us from Covington & Burling and can be contacted 
on 0171 970 7433 or at mslade@enron.co.uk.

Thanks to all of you for your assistance and advice over the past few years, 
it has been a pleasure working with you.

Kindest regards,
Sasha


Per,

What's the deal he's talking about?  I also do not think we could put ENA and 
Enron Metals Ltd. trades under the same master.  When you have a mingute give 
me a ring.

My guess--- we trade with most of Per Sekse funds and this issue should be 
clarified

I do not know the answer to your question.  I suggest you talk to Credit.  
Financial does indeed have a master with Weyerhaueser Company Limited.  I 
have no idea what we trade physical under or what other Weyerhaueser  
companies we may have business with.

		 Subject: Clickpaper Credit Response 090700

Karen et al.,

To begin with, I contacted Legal (Tana Jones) in reference to Weyerhaeuser 
Company listed on the Clickpaper Credit Response 090700, and left her a 
voicemail message since she was not available.  She has not yet responded.

Since then, I have been in contact with Global Counterparty and they have 
advised me that the CP#11319 Weyerhaeuser Company (the CP reported on 
Clickpaper 090700) is the parent to CP#81012 Weyerhaeuser Company Limited 
(the CP that we currently have an executed contract ). 

Based on similar issues in the past, and supported by Mary Solomonson's 
agreement with the Legal department, the Global Contracts group will not 
provide a response until Legal clarifies the issue.  Accordingly, we will not 
include the current Global Contract number given to CP#81012 Weyerhaeuser 
Company Limited unless and until Legal approves the contract for Weyerhaeuser 
Company.

Regards,
Bridgette


I am just confirming with each of you that I will be opening up The Toa 
Reinsurance Company Limited, a Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list to 
trade all physical and financial products, including Australian and Japanese 
weather, which seems to be the products they are truly interested in 
trading.  Let me know if you have any problems with that immediately.I sent down the list for 9/27/00 on Friday.  On the 9/26/00 list, for Edison 
Mission Marketing & Trade, I am showing them as "amended-no change" becuase I 
already had them open for emissions.  Same on FPL Energy Power Marketing, I 
am showing them as "amended-no change" because I already had them opened for 
physical gas.


I confirmed w/Brad that they are still an ESP, so it's OK to open them up for 
all financial.

Tana, I have a second user applying for this company.  I show them as not 
open for trade - is this still correct? Not really urgent...
Thanks,
Camille

Will do, I'll send you a copy too.  I'm just waiting to get Sara's direction 
on one comment to the Legal Opinion, then I'll be ready to send it out.

As you all are probably aware, we trade physical and financial products with 
Northern Illinois Gas Company under each of the following names:

1  Northern Illinois Gas Company (the legal incorporated entity)
2.  Nicor Gas Company (an assumed name for Northern Illinois Gas Company as 
reflected in the Assumed Name Certificate dated 12/15/99 filed with the 
Secretary of State of Illinois.  The name needs to match the Assumed Name 
Certificate, no "Co.")
3.  Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company

The EnronOnline counterparty has been set up as "Nicor Gas Company".

Pursuant to Bob Bruce's conversation with our Illinois outside counsel, we 
are comfortable transacting business in the State of Illinois under the 
assumed name "Nicor Gas Company".  In connection therewith, it is OK to set 
up the online entity as "Nicor Gas Company", and attach the relevant physical 
or financial products to the relevant master under each of the above 
counterparty names.  Further, it will be OK if the confirmations go out as 
"Nicor Gas Company" even though the masters may be under one of the above 
names.

PLEASE NOTE, HOWEVER, this should be considered an exception to the rule.  We 
do not want counterparties to be set up under assumed names, d/b/a's or 
divisions for EnronOnline.  As previously agreed with the Online team, every 
attempt should be made to incorporate the legal name as part of the 
counterparty name (such as "Northern Illinois Gas Company d/b/a Nicor Gas 
Company" or "Koch Industries, Inc. acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon 
Company Division").   Any exceptions to this should be run by Legal for 
approval.Did you make a note under H.Q. Energy Services in Lotus Notes...?

Mike, have you been able to figure out how to get Brent Hendry, who is now in 
Buenos Aires, access to our Master Swap Agreement database?  Can you let me 
know.  I'm getting bugged about this.At the request of Sara Shackleton, Senior Counsel, I am attaching a copy of 
our proposed form of Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement and proposed form 
of counterparty legal opinion.  If you have any questions, please call Sara 
at (713) 853-5620 or me at (713) 853-3399.  We look forward to getting your 
comments.
We have received a revised Unanimous Consent of Directors dated 8/28/00 
("Board Resolution") from the referenced Counterparty which expands the 
approval given in their initial Board Resolution (provided when we executed 
the ISDA Master Agreement) to allow them to enter into "pulp, lumber and 
paper commodity price swap and options, and other commodity price swap and 
option transactions"  with ENA.

For ClickPaper, this should allow them to trade all the financial products we 
trade.  For EnronOnline, this should allow them to trade all commodity swaps 
and options.  If Credit will add this to the next spreadsheets for both 
ClickPaper and EnronOnline, I will amend my approval.

I will circulate a copy of the revised Board Resolution to Global Contracts 
and Camille Gerard.Pretty funny!  I went over to harass him, but he must be on vacation!

Hi!

Thanks for your help.  According to Matt Dawson, it looks like a signed ISDA 
has been executed between ENA and Utilicorp United Inc. in the past.  We will 
also need an ISDA between ECTRIC and Utilicorp United Inc.  You mentioned 
perhaps mirroring the existing ISDA however with the restricted lists I 
believe you will be to obtain the copy easier than we will.  However, if you 
would like Utilicorp to produce a draft, let  me know and I can request that 
from the woman in the e.mail below. 

Please advise and I will pass the information on to Utilicorp.

Thank you

Good Morning Tana,

Thank you so much for faxing the ISDA with Utilicorp.  However would you be 
so kind to send the 1st 18 pages again.  They seem to have disappeared in our 
office.  I have everything after that (Schedule to the Master Agreement, 
Credit Support Annex, Paragraph 13 Annex, Exhibit A to Paragraph 13, and 
Exhibit A Guaranty)

I would greatly appreciate if you would fax the first 18 pages of the ISDA 
(footer states "ISDA 1992") to +47 23 10 25 50.

Thank you for your help.

Have a great day and weekend.
Sincerely,
Yumi Takei

r=20
Trading on NYMEX ACCESS


Notice No. 00-347
October 6, 2000

MEMORANDUM

TO: ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS

FROM: Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

DATE: October 6, 2000

RE:
Notice of CFTC Approval of Executive Committee Resolution Amending Price=20
Fluctuation Limits for Trading on NYMEX ACCESSc
____________________________________________________________________

Please be advised that the CFTC has approved a Resolution of the Executive=
=20
Committee of the Board of Directors.  The Resolution amends on a temporary=
=20
basis a number of Exchange price fluctuation limit rules for trading on NYM=
EX=20
ACCESSc so as to ensure the successful implementation of the new implied=20
order functionality on NYMEX ACCESSc. (The price fluctuation limit rules th=
at=20
are now in effect for the Exchange=01,s contracts will remain the same for=
=20
trading occurring during Regular Trading Hours ("RTH") on the trading=20
floor.)  The Resolution is attached and will become effective with the=20
commencement of the NYMEX ACCESSc session on Sunday, October 8, 2000.

By significantly expanding the price fluctuation limits applicable to tradi=
ng=20
activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc, the Resolution reduces the possibility=
=20
that a price limit would be triggered by the implied functionality.  The=20
Resolution amends the Exchange=01,s price fluctuation limit rules with rega=
rd to=20
trading on NYMEX ACCESSc in three ways:

(1) The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange=
=20
futures contract that has such limits) would be expanded to 200% of the=20
initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two=
=20
contract months for energy contracts, or to the first contract month with=
=20
limits in effect for metals contracts, of that futures contract under the=
=20
applicable rule.

(2) This expanded limit (e.g., 200% of the limits for the front two months=
=20
for energy contracts) would be applicable to all contract months for that=
=20
futures contract.

(3) In the event that an expanded price limit was touched by a bid or offer=
,=20
trading on NYMEX ACCESSc generally would be halted immediately, rather than=
=20
requiring the market to trade at that price for five minutes. During the la=
st=20
90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market would be halted only far =
as=20
long as it takes for the system to incorporate expanded price limits.

Finally, notwithstanding the changes noted above, in the event that a=20
contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded for five minutes at a price=20
fluctuation limit applicable to RTH trading, then the RTH session would ope=
n=20
with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided under the applicable rul=
e,=20
even though there had been no temporary cessation of trading during the NYM=
EX=20
ACCESSc trading session.

If you have any questions, please contact Stu Homler, Director, NYMEX ACCES=
Sc=20
Operations, NYMEX ACCESSc Department, at (212) 299-2754, Matt Morano, NYMEX=
=20
ACCESSc Department, at (212) 299-2679, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate=20
General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.

APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING PRICE
FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby

Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for=
=20
each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESSc and that=
=20
has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below=
=20
with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESSc:

The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange=20
futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the=20
initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two=
=20
contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the=
=20
applicable rule.

This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limit=
s)=20
shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract.

In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide=
=20
bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low pri=
ce=20
fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESSc shall be halted immediately=20
except as directed otherwise by the President or the President=01,s designe=
e. =20
Following resumption of trading, the price limits in effect shall be 200% o=
f=20
the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched=
=20
during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESSc session, the market shall be=
=20
halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter

In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESSc traded f=
or=20
five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESSc session at a price fluctuation limit=
=20
applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the RTH session shall=

rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading occurred during the NYM=

HI Tana 

Here is the Amendment Agreement containg the additional "online" wording 
agreed for the ECTRIC ISDA  that  Barclays want included in the ENA Isda. I 
hope this is O.K. If you need anything else please call. Will also  enter the 
new ISDA in data base ASAP.

Subject: Barclays Guarantee and requested Amendment Agreement

 Hi  Justin,

Just to let you know the Guarantee arrived from Houston this morning. I have 
sent it on to Leigh. Also she requested that we amend the other Existing ISDA 
Master Agreement Barclays has with Enron North America, dated 13 Jan 1994 to 
include the Part 5(h) and(o)  wording dealing with  Procedures for entering 
into Transactions(Online and others), and also the Part 6 wording dealing 
with Additional Provisions for Commodity Derivatives Transactions.

I attatch her proposed amendment agreement. The wording of the clauses is 
identical to that which was agreed in the ECTRIC  Master that has just been 
signed, although the numbering of Part 5 (o) differs in the recent Isda with 
ECTRIC. Barclays cannot trade with ENA until the Isda has been amended.  Are 
we able to accommodate the   agreement?

  





Attached is the referenced list.  I am saying "amended-no change" because for 
Calpine, I originally had them open for power & financial, and I am not 
changing that approval, and for Nicor, I originally had them open for 
financial and shut down for power and I am not changing that approval.I'm preparing for a presentation I have to give tomorrow.  Once I'm done with 
this I'll give you a call...

Enron Canada has a Master Agreement [ECT form, non ISDA] in place with Energy 
West Incorporated (which ENA could trade under per the Services Agreement 
with ECC covering financial trades only).  Per my conversation a second ago 
with Credit, Energy West Incorporated and Energy West Resources are not 
showing up in their records as being one and the same corporation.  Sounds to 
me you need to call Credit for approval.  If we do not have a master, they 
would have to get Credit approval to do a trade w/o a master in place.

Tana,

Here's a Draft I had in my personal file.  I thought this would be easier 
than deleting the coding from the system template

Joe










Can you pass this on to the next person...thanks!

Subject: Northern Natural Gas Company

It has been brought to my attention that we have done several internal trades 
the last few days with the referenced wholly owned Enron company (right 
Tony?!).  With Tanya's approval, we need to get out an ISDA Master between 
Northern and RMT with no credit except the standard change of ownership 
clauses.   If that is OK with Tanya, Susan, can you pass on this master to 
the next paralegal in the rotation.  Tony will attend to getting the master 
signed from Northern's side.

Thanks.

On the 10/05/00 List:  Tembec, Inc.'s bylaws require that agreements signed 
by the company must be signed by any two of the following officers:   the 
President or a Vice President together with any Director, Secretary or 
Assistant Secretary.  If you are going to trade with them online you must 
ensure that the Password Application gets signed by those officers, or if not 
by those officers, they must provide a resolution if any officer except those 
above signs the documentation.  Because of this signatory restriction 
EnronOnline was hesitant to open them for financial trading.  It's up to your 
group, but you must comply with these special signatory requirements.  If you 
would like Legal to pass on the documentation if you are unsure, forward it 
up to me.

I have been given your name by Justin Boyd as someone who can help me or 
point me in the right direction.

We need to raise a power of attorney to enable Amita Gosalia of Enron House 
to execute EnronOnline Password Applications for each of the above company.  
Please could you let me know if you can prepare such a document and also what 
if any additional information you require.  I have attached a copy of the 
Power of Attorney which we use in the UK for such authority for your 
information.



Unfortunately this is becoming quite urgent and any assistance you can give 
will be greatly appreciated.

Please let me know if you have any queries.

Thanks and regardsBrent,

I am having this woman with Duke here in Houston, Roni Cappadonna, calling me 
wanting to get the form of the confirmation.  I don't know what to tell her.  
Can we get her a draft of a confirm with proposed deal terms or do we have to 
wait until the trade is done?  I think the person that really needs to be 
handling this is Dale Neuner, not me.  I am kinda just in the middle of the 
confirm thing.  Can we get Scott Neal, or whoever needs to relay the confirm 
information, to deal with Dale Neuner directly, so we can get Dale dealing 
with Roni.FYI-waiting for direction.

Thanks.Just a reminder that we have the Customer Access Agreement that Craig Breslau 
sent up for our review.  We need to (1) determine what procedures, if any, we 
need to put in place with respect to user ID's to other online trading

I do not know of any reason that they should not be able to transact UK oil 
and products. However, it would be best to also check with London on this 
request.

As some of you may be aware, there have been substantial revisions to the 
U.S. Tax Code which will require revising the tax language in our swap 
agreements.  I will be providing Steve Douglas in the Tax Dept. copies of the 
current tax language in our swap agreements and will coordinate with him 
revisions to the forms.  I'll keep you posted when the changes occur.Can y'all help me get the document below signed by an officer of ECC and 
return the originally signed document to me.  I will send them all out 
together back to the counterparty.  FYI-Andy Zipper is second in command to 
Louise Kitchen for EnronOnline.  Thanks for your help!

Per Leslie's earlier email, she wants power trading for Tri-State only under 
one entity, so I have shut down Tri-State Power Marketing (the division), and 
have opened them up under Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, 
Inc., which, per my conv. w/Stephanie, is being amended to add "through its 
Tri-State Power Marketing Division" to the PA.
For the online trading project, I am trying to track down for the U.K., the 
Datasource, Reporting Service, and Reporting Agency for the GTC.  I 
understand that you might either have that information or be able to direct 
me to someone who does.  I appreciate whatever help you can give me!I just spoke to Frank, and spoke to Jeff Blumenthal earlier this week about 
tax issues arising out of Amita executing documents on behalf of EOL and 
ENA.  Frank just informed me that the Japan office has also been provided 
with stamp of Sheri Thomas's signature so they can execute PA's out of 
Japan.  Frank and I were thinking we might want to get together sometime next 
week to discuss this.In order to improve communication between the Legal Department and our Online 
team, Mark Haedicke has asked us to prepare a list of legal contacts which we 
will be providing to the Online team.  Before we send this out, I have been 
asked to send the list to each of you for your input.  Please let me or 
Leslie Hansen know of any additional contacts or changes that you feel we 
need to make to the list.


I do not believe that statement is correct.  The limitation was required in 
the corporate documents of the company, so it should apply to all 
agreements.  Can you send me up a copy of the Password Application and I will 
give Steve Norris a call.  Thanks.

Tana,

We now have an application from Tembec, Inc.   Steven Norris, as Treasurer, 
is the one signing the Password Application for Tembec.   When John Cummings 
met with him last week, Steve stated that he would be involved in setting up 
the users for Physical transactions.

After reading the requirements below, it sounds like the two signature rule 
applies to Financial transactions only.

In other words, can we set up Steve as well as his users with Physical access 
without two officers' signing?

If so, then we could get them on-line with Physical access and then work on 
whatever we need for Financial access.

Thanks for your help!

Subject: ClickPaper Approvals for 10/05/00 and 10/06/00

On the 10/05/00 List:  Tembec, Inc.'s bylaws require that agreements signed 
by the company must be signed by any two of the following officers:   the 
President or a Vice President together with any Director, Secretary or 
Assistant Secretary.  If you are going to trade with them online you must 
ensure that the Password Application gets signed by those officers, or if not 
by those officers, they must provide a resolution if any officer except those 
above signs the documentation.  Because of this signatory restriction 
EnronOnline was hesitant to open them for financial trading.  It's up to your 
group, but you must comply with these special signatory requirements.  If you 
would like Legal to pass on the documentation if you are unsure, forward it 
up to me.

		 Subject: EOL-Weather trading-Password applications

Dear Tana,

Re Japanese counterparties generally, we are preparing a list of documents to 
be submitted at time of application for passwords, as well as a check box for 
use by EOL staff in considering applications to deal with the various general 
legal issues which have been raised.  (The idea is that anything which falls 
out of the boxes comes to me for separate consideration but we trying to do 
it to minimize this need.) 

Re Japanese counterparties which want to do weather, the safest approach for 
a would-be counter party which is not a bank, securities company or insurance 
company (or at least does not have these words in its name) is for the 
application to come back to me in Tokyo for consideration in the context of 
the laws which prohibit gambling and what we can do to protect ourselves.  

Thanks.

Jane McBride

Per a head's up from Tanya, LG&E Power Marketing was merged into LG&E Energy 
Marketing and is no longer an active corporation.  Take it off the executed 
master list. Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of 
Engage Energy US, L.P., now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P., which 
guarantees the obligations of ENA under an  ISDA Master Agreement.  We will 
need the standard executed copy.  This guaranty will supersede and replace, 
in part, the prior guaranty with respect to ENA and Counterparty.  The 
guaranty will be fully replaced when counterparty receives the new Enron 
Corp. Guaranty with respect to the obligations of Enron Canada and Engage 
Canada (still covered under the existing guaranty, and such replacement is 
still under negotiation).

 Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the 
documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
Attached is documentation filed with the Delaware Secretary of State 
reflecting the name change of Engage Energy US, L.P. to Coastal Merchant

I have been asked by Credit.com whether there are ISDA agreements in place 
with the above mentioned banks (who are about to merge). I suspect the answer 
is No but please can we find out.
Thanks.


I  think maybe if we could get together with Frank and call Jeff then we 
could resolve this w/o continuing circular conversations.  Jeff is familiar 
with the issue now.

I just spoke to Frank, and spoke to Jeff Blumenthal earlier this week about 
tax issues arising out of Amita executing documents on behalf of EOL and 
ENA.  Frank just informed me that the Japan office has also been provided 
with stamp of Sheri Thomas's signature so they can execute PA's out of 
Japan.  Frank and I were thinking we might want to get together sometime next 
week to discuss this.


Below is an icon that will get you view access to the financial agreement 
database.  This lists all the financial agreements we either have executed or 
have drafts out to the counterparty (except Australia, which we are currently 
loading into the database).   This database is available with view access to 
any Enron employee.  If you have any questions about a specific entry, please 
do not hesitate to call me (or email me!).

These could take a few days (or more!).  They have to be circulated to the

go ahead and start signing now and I'll make her appointment effective as of

First, this counterparty is OK to trade physical power.  I just spoke to 
Leslie, and she said it was OK to set up "Ameren Energy, Inc. as  Agent " 
under one cpy id # for the three utilities and that's how they would trade.  
We spoke to Melissa Murphy on the Power Confirm Desk and she is going to set 
up a special confirmation template that will add the three utilities names to 
the confirmations before they go out.  I think this is how Global 
Counterparty already set them up.  If this doesn't compute, let me know...

The Confirmations would then go out as Ameren Energy, Inc., as Authorized 
Agent for and on behalf of Ameren Energy Marketing Company, Ameren Energy 
Gathering Company, and Union Electric Company (d/b/a Ameren UE).Are you holding up this cpy for any reason?

I ran into Gaffer for the 1st time in months.  By his traveling schedule, I

Hi Tana

Michael has asked me to get in touch with you to apologise for not contacting 
you earlier and to say that unfortunately Clarissa is very ill and in and out 
of hospital so he will not be able to contact for the next couple of weeks.  
Consequently, he will not be in the office the  rest of the week and will 
also not be in next week.  He is not picking up his emails but is picking up 
voicemails.  If you would like me to pass any message on to him, please just 
email me or call me on 0207 783 7212.

Thanks
Fiona
I'm OK all day long, so just email me when you want to chat (our time) and 
I'll make sure I'm at my desk.

Just a note to remind you to add the "ESP' and "Country" information to 
clickpaper spreadsheets too so I can get those out while you're gone.At the request of David Minns their short name in Lotus Notes will be EAF 
(for Enron Australia Finance).   David gave me a list of their masters, so I 
am going to enter just the names and agreement.  David and Alison will flesh 
out the rest of the data when he gets back.Leslie Hansen just called me and it appears the power traders have asked her 
to review the ETA for trading on the Dynegy Website.  I told her we were 
meeting to develop a policy about the opening of such websites, that we had 
no board resolutions passed allowing the opening of them, nor do we have 
control procedures in place about where statements go, etc., so we can 
control and prevent "rogue" trading.  She said before she sent this out she 
would contact you.The Australia office gave me a list of their masters and I have entered them 
into the database.  We still don't have copies.  Further, I don't know more 
than if it's executed and the date.   They need to flesh out the additional 
information that is required.ANP Marketing Company has faxed in their PA and ETA amendment and we should 
get the originals in by fedex today.  They are hot to trade ERCOT online, and 
I don't know if they can trade it or not, but if we could move them up to the 
top of the credit review list they would be most happy.The critical documents are usually the masters and any guarantees issued.  
Thanks for your help.

TO:
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS
ALL MEMBER FIRMS

FROM: Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice-President

SUBJECT: PROPOSED RULE TO ALLOW STRIP TRADING IN PROPANE
______________________________________________________________________________
___

The NYMEX Board of Directors has voted to allow strip trading in the Propane 
Contract.  The proposed amendment to Rule 6.08D must be reviewed by the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) prior to implementation.  The 
proposed rule amendment is attached below.

This rule amendment will become effective after CFTC approval is received.  
The Membership will be notified when strip trading will begin.

If you have any questions, please contact Daniel Brusstar at (212) 299-2604.

PROPOSED RULE AMENDMENT
(*Asteriks* surrounding a word or phrase represent an addition, and 
[brackets] a deletion)

NYMEX Floor Rules
Rule 6.08D.   STRIP TRANSACTIONS

(A) Definition:  A strip transaction shall consist of either the simultaneous 
purchase or sale of an equal number of contracts in each of two or more 
consecutive contract months for crude oil futures, natural gas futures, 
heating oil futures, gasoline futures, *propane futures,* or electricity 
futures for a single account that is quoted and traded at a single price.

(B) Floor Members executing strip transactions shall properly record them in 
writing so as to permit the identification of the strip transactions and the 
parties thereto.  All strip transactions for futures contracts for crude oil, 
natural gas, heating oil, gasoline, *propane,* or electricity on the Exchange 
trading floor must be made by open outcry in the trading rings for crude oil, 
natural gas, heating oil, gasoline, *propane,* or electricity, as 
applicable.  All strip transactions must be in line with prevailing contract 
prices for strip transactions and the prices of futures contracts for crude 
oil, natural gas, heating oil, gasoline,  *propane,* or electricity, as 
applicable, comprising the strip transaction shall be within the permissible 
price limits of the contract months traded.

(C) The seller in each strip transaction must report on the hard copy ply of 
his or her trading card the price of the strip transaction to the Exchange.  
The Exchange shall then assign the prices for each of the crude oil, natural 
gas, heating oil, gasoline, *propane,* or electricity futures contracts 
months comprising the strip transaction pursuant to a methodology as 
established by the Exchange.

(D) Except as provided in Rule 6.08C(C), strip transactions shall not set off 
stops in any contract.

I assume you have heard that EOL is soliciting HoustonStreet.com and 
QuickQuote.com in order to 
increase their volume and market coverage.  The message below is from Ron 
Nolte, our IT person
for the confirmation systems.  I think he is asking some very pertinent 
questions that may need your
legal opinion.

I guess my fear is that you have not been included in the conversations and 
set-up of EOL's discussions
with HoustonStreet.com and QuickQuote.com.

To: Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Torrey 
Moorer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Johnson/Corp/Enron@Enron
cc:  
Subject: City Streets


Just came back from a meeting in which Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny and Torrey 
Moorer informed everyone about the new venture 
between HoustonStreet.Com and Enron and QuickQuote.com and Enron.   In 90 
days, HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com will be offering products offered 
on EOL.

I solicit comments from everyone.

As I understand it, a party wishing to trade gas and power can log onto 
HoustonStreet.Com and  deals offered on EOL will 
magically appear. The party might think, "Hey, I can't do better than this on 
EOL, I'll take this deal".  The deal is transacted   
and HoustonStreet.Com number is assigned.  As soon as the "Do the Deal"  
button is clicked, the transaction is sent to EOL where
it is validated.  An EOL deal number is assigned but as far as the party 
doing the deal is concerned, the deal is a HoustonStreet.Com deal.

In the case of a gas deal,  the deal will be bridged to both Sitara and 
TAGG.  The deal at this point would have four deal numbers:

  HoustonStreet.Com Deal #
  EOL Deal #
  Sitara Deal #
  TAGG Deal #

Based on the meeting, the following requirements surfaced.  If you are in 
TAGG,  you should be able to access the deal using
HoustonStreet.Com  Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the TAGG Deal #.

If you are in DCAF II,  you should be able to access the deal using 
HoustonStreet.Com Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the Sitara Deal #.

This requirement implies that the capture windows in TAGG and Sitara ( I 
assume ) will need to be changed to capture both
the HoustonStreet.Com Deal # and EOL Deal #.  The TAGG Deal number itself  is 
assigned by the Capture program.

This will require a database change as well as fairly significant ( it was 
assumed that there is only one "Originating System")  program modifications 
to TAGG Deal Capture, TAGG Deal Clearing,  DCAF II, and Enpower Autoconfirm ( 
clears Power deals ).

Now for some issues:

1) Who is the internal party on the deal that is to appear on the 
confirmation?  Will a HoustonStreet.Com and
 a QuickQuote internal party be set up in Global Counterparty?  

 There are implications for Global Counterparty since all address information 
is set up based on who the external party is doing business with.

 In other words, if there are new internal parties, the address information 
set up for these same external  parties that do trades on EOL will
 have to be set up again for doing business with the new internal parties.

2) Is the confirm to sport a HoustonStreet.Com logo and a QuickQuote.com logo?

3) Who is to sign the confirmation letters when signatures are required?

4) Contract numbers will have to be set up just as they are for trading under 
EOL.  But who are the contracts between?  If
 new internal parties are set up for HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com, 
then contracts will have to be set up
 between the new internal parties.  But since a HoustonStreet.Com deal goes 
through EOL, how will the appropriate
 contract be assigned?; i.e., if Koch does a deal through HoustonStreet.Com, 
is  a different contract assigned 
 in EOL versus if Koch does the deal through EOL itself?

Last week Tana and I discussed geeting the Australian ISDA Masrer Agreements 
loaded onto the the international data base. I already have access to this 
data base through Lotus Notes.

The agreed actions were

Tana would arrange for Alison, Rob and myself to have update and view access.
Tana would work with Alison on getting existing Australian ISDAs loaded up 
and explaining functionality.

Tana how are we going with access? We can then get things moving.  



Attached is a clean and blacklined draft of the changes to the ISDA 
Schedule.  We have also attached the proposed form of Enron Corp. Guaranty 
and the legal opinions of Enron North America and Enron Corp.  The opinions 
of Cadwalader with respect to the ISDA and the Guaranty will be sent shortly 
under separate cover from Susan Lobel at Cadwalader.  It appears the only 
remaining issue on the ISDA is the "Conditions Precedent" provision which 
NYPA is still considering.

Please let me know if these changes meet with your approval.

The attached GTC should not be used in relation to any financial product.  It 
reads as if it is to apply to physical lumber deals.  However, by copy of 
this memo to Tana, I ask that she verify that it has been an approved 
document for physical online lumber.

Mary,

Should the following document be attached to all lumber deals?  Recently, 
there was a clickpaper deal for lumber; the online GTC was attached to the 
confirmation.  But, a question on this document has since been raised.

Please advise.



Thanks,

We have received the originally executed Letter Agreement amending the 
referenced Electronic Trading Agreement.  Copies will be distributed.

We also received the originally executed Password Application and Customer 
Registration Form.  I will send those down to EOL and no copies will be kept 
in Legal.Mark Taylor asked me to run something on Online Trading by you.  We got a 
list of questions on various Online Trading issues from the Products Control 
Group which appears to be the group the will be managing the Online Trading 
HelpDesk.  One of their questions related to the desire of HelpDesk managers 
to periodically listen in on phone calls with the customer to ensure what 
they explained as a "quality control" over the responses given to customers 
on the HelpDesk.  They explained it as being like when your credit card 
company has an announcement that says the calls may be monitored from time to 
time.

Is this something we want to do?  If we do, that brings up other issues, and 
we will have to run this by our outside counsel, Sullivan & Cromwell.

Can you let me know your thoughts...Thanks!----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 10/20/2000 09:49 AM -----

		 Subject: ISDA Master Agreement Data Base

Last week Tana and I discussed geeting the Australian ISDA Masrer Agreements 
loaded onto the the international data base. I already have access to this 
data base through Lotus Notes.

The agreed actions were

Tana would arrange for Alison, Rob and myself to have update and view access.
Tana would work with Alison on getting existing Australian ISDAs loaded up 
and explaining functionality.

Tana how are we going with access? We can then get things moving.  



Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  You 
should have edit access (non-Legal or Credit employees can get view access 
only.  They should not see our comments.  That information is confidential 
and subject to attorney/client privilege).   Let me know if you do not have 
edit access.  Please do not edit entries for companies or agreements outside 
your area of responsibility.  A few notes...

There is some great reporting functionality in this database.  Check out some 
of the sorts on the left.  There is a drop down called "Pending Swap 
Update".  That sort will create a list of all executed and draft financial 
agreements.  There are ways you can sort the Pending Swap Update to generate 
reports for you compan

The "restrictions" column should be limited to only those issues that are 
critical to trading/confirmations/settlement.  Kinda, before you do/authorize 
a trade read this.  Not for general legal notes.  

Once an agreement's status is coded "executed", it should never be coded 
elsewise (it will mess up reporting).  If you are amending an agreement or 
superseding and replacing one, code the status "executed-under amendment".

 I should be the only one coded to change the "keywords" in the drop downs.  
If you need keywords added, send me an email and I will add them for you.  

Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

Group-

Earlier this week, we met Tana Jones (Senior Legal Specialist) and Leslie 
Hansen (Legal Counsel) with ENA (servicing ENW) to discuss the process for 
executing NDAs.  Leslie will serve as in-house legal counsel for EMS while 
Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all documentation such as NDAs.

There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is 
bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business 
information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly 
articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is 
the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact 
Tana via email (tana.jones@enron.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the 
following information:
 1.  Which form you would like to use
 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared
 3.  Counterparty's legal name
 4.  Counterparty's address
 5.  Contact name at Counterparty
 6.  How/where to send NDA and appropriate information (fax or email and 
number or address).

counterparty should wire funds per an ISDA.  We have a counterparty that 
wants this info in case a confirm doesn't specifically provide it.

Thanks,

Jason

There are a number of Argentina counterparties on this list that I will need 
your sign off on.  Brent said he things they will probably be OK to trade 
Argentina Gas, but to run it by you.  Can you let me know if you have any 
issues.

I am going to have to add you to the distribution for my daily lists too.  
Initially, we should have a rush of Argentina counterparties, but after 
awhile, it should dwindle.  The rule is, you have ONE DAY to respond  or I 
will consider you have no legal problems with a counterparty on the list.

London to get this counterparty approved ASAP.  Since you are the key person, 
I thought I'd pull you into the loop.  This counterparty should be coming 
thru on tomorrow's approval list.  I know you've got to do your due

Anna,

I just wanted to confirm with you that all fuel & liquids customers, 
including those from Singapore, are being handled by credit in Houston now 
that the responsibility for Global Products has moved from London to Houston. 
I spoke with Sheri Thomas & Tom Moran (Houston credit) this morning & they 
both agreed that these (Asia Pacific) counterparties should now be handled by 
Houston. However there still appears to be some confusion over this issue so 
I would appreciate it if you could send a reply confirming that this is the 
understanding at your end so as to avoid any further confusion.

Many thanks

Justin

I spoke with Frank Davis in Houston yesterday about this PA and he agreed 
that Houston PCG would ensure that this customer was reviewed in Houston and 
set up as soon as possible.  I have also confirmed with Frank and Amita 
Gosalia the situation with regards to responsibilities for Japan when 
processing PAs.  Japan has always been the responsibility of the Houston PCG 
except in the case of metals customers which are approved by credit and legal 
in London.

It would seem that this is an issue that needs to be discussed further 
between the London, Houston and Australia groups to establish responsibilites 
further. Hopefully this will ensure that this type of confusion does not 
occur again and delay the processing of a customer application.

Bo,

I put Idemitsu's PA into the database  for credit review on Sept 26 & it was 
picked up by John Suttle in Houston. I haven't heard anything since & seeing 
as they appear to be a fuel & oils customer I have today changed the RAC to 
London so that the PA can be processed over there, which is probably where it 
should have gone in the first place. I apologise for the delay and 
inconvenience however there was initially some confusion between myself & 
Houston as to where Asia Pacific fuel & oil customers should be processed.

Justin,

Idemitsu Kosan in Japan sent in a PA on 29 Sept to your office.

Bo Petersen of our Global Products team has been getting calls from them 
wanting to know the status of their PA as they are very anxious to get online.

The database says 'Credit Reviewing' - can you please feed back any comments 
or updates to Bo and the London PCG directly?  I will be out of the office on 
Monday and want to ensure that Bo knows what to tell the customer should they 
call again.

Thank you,

Per Jane's email, I think we can definitely approve them to trade Japanese 
products.  I want to confirm with her the approval for the rest of the 
products, tho I think they'll probably be OK too.  So today, you could open 
them for Japan.

Dear Tana,

I was surprised to see that Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. has not been approved 
for (did not apply for approval for I guess) any Japanese products; in which 
case I wonder why they are using the Japanese parent company and not a US or 
other sub.  As per email yesterday, fine for them to do EOL trading generally 
but could you just check that it is the Japanese entity which has been 
approved and that they will not be doing any Japanese products.

Thanks.

Just following up from our conversation last week.  We continue to do a large 
amount of transactions with this counterparty which are being confirmed 
through our long form agreements without credit terms.  To the extent that 
you decide not to forward the ISDA at this time, please let me know so that I 
can make a determination whether or not we need to reduce trade in order to 
control Enron's credit exposure.  Please let me know the status.

Euromoney stopped doing their great seminar a few years back.  We have not 
yet found any other seminar that equals it.  I'll keep my eyes posted, 
though.

Are either of you aware of any master documentation workshops being offered 
in NYC or London in the next few months that would be worthwhile for Jane 
McBride to attend?  I remember several years ago going to a program that 
Euromoney (or Eurocurrency) put on for 2-days focusing on ISDA's. 

Please advise. Thanks.
You bet.  I faxed a copy out to them earlier this afternoon.  We also faxed a 
copy to London, and hope to get it back signed by EnronCredit.com first thing 
tomorrow morning.

Unfortunately Euromoney is no longer offering their courses.  They were by 
far the best around and it's a real shame.  There is a PLI course being 
offered in NY in mid November (at which I'm speaking on commodity 
derivatives) and ISDA has a conference in London on collateral arrangements 
and the ISDA Credit Support Documents.  Neither is anywhere near as good as 
the old Euromoney courses but both would probably benefit Jane.

Attached are some of the new steel counterparties.  I need to give EOL 
responses by Friday for all these counterparties.  In addition, we should 
have more coming through, for a total of about 100-150 new counterparties we 
have to approve by Friday.  I will need your responses, if any, ASAP, as I 
still need to fill in Legal's approvals and return them.  Thanks!

Mark, It seems to me Erica's advice needs to apply not only to this NDA, but 
probably all of the NDA's that are going to originate from the Houston based 
EnronCredit.com business team.  Further, it should apply not only to NDA's, 
but their whole business they are originating from Houston, yes?  Maybe you 
need to talk to Erica...

Michael Slade forwarded me your advice  with respect to the Non-Disclosure 
Agreement with i2 Technologies.  We appreciate your help on this.  Per my 
conversation with Mark Taylor, this NDA will probably be the first of many 
coming from the EnronCredit.com business group located here in Houston and 
pursuing US based customers.  We wanted to confirm with you that on a going 
forward basis that are no tax problems with these EnronCredit.com employees 
executing NDA's as well as other contracts here in Houston.  Thanks for your 
help with this.We have received the fully executed Non-Disclosure Agreement by and among 
Pure Markets Corporation and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Works LLC 
and EnronOnline, LLC dated 10/25/00.  Copies will be distributed.Per our conversation, my name is Tana Jones and I am a paralegal here in 
Houston Legal.  I am your first point of contact when you need to get an NDA 
out to a counterparty.  I work with Leslie Hansen, an attorney in our group.  
She will negotiate any comments to the NDA's or review forms of NDA's 
provided by counterparties.  We can also assist you with other types of 
contracts you might need.  My # is x33399 and Leslie's is x36121.

To draft an NDA I will need the following information:

1.  What form of NDA do you want.  We have 2 forms, one where only Enron is 
providing confidential information, and a bilateral agreement where both 
parties are providing confidential information.  If we have a situation where 
we truly are the only one providing confidential information we prefer to use 
the one-way form, it is drafted much more in our favor.
2.  What is the project or nature of your business with the cusomer?
3.  The counterparty's full legal name.
4.  Counterparty's address.
5.  Contact name at the counterparty.
6.  How you would like the NDA sent to the counterparty.  If you would like 
to to fax it, please provide the fax and phone number.  If you would like me 
to email the agreement, I'll need an email address.  If you would like to 
send it yourself, I will forward it to you.
7.  If you have a deadline for execution, please let us know.

I look forward to working with you!

		 Subject: NDA process

Group-

Earlier this week, we met Tana Jones (Senior Legal Specialist) and Leslie 
Hansen (Legal Counsel) with ENA (servicing ENW) to discuss the process for 
executing NDAs.  Leslie will serve as in-house legal counsel for EMS while 
Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all documentation such as NDAs.

There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is 
bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business 
information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly 
articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is 
the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact 
Tana via email (tana.jones@enron.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the 
following information:
 1.  Which form you would like to use
 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared
 3.  Counterparty's legal name
 4.  Counterparty's address
 5.  Contact name at Counterparty
 6.  How/where to send NDA and appropriate information (fax or email and 
number or address).

Regards,

-DovieAttached is the one way (counterparty) only form you requuested.

Actually, can we amend it so that it is "unilateral" on the part of Enron (we 
agree not to disclose information they give us, but not the other way 
around)?  EnronCredit is not providing Duke with any confidential

Just a note re: "Miller Balish O'Neil PC" on the list from the 25th.  I just 
had a conversation with Mark about that one, it sounds awfully like a law 
firm to us.  Unless a member of the Legal Dept. requests a guest ID for a law 
firm doing legal research for us, we should never grant guest ID's to a law 
firm.  It can only hurt us!  It's possible it could be an accounting firm.  
Per Mark, we wouldn't want to grant accounting firms access either.  "PC" 
(for professional corporation) is a good giveaway that we might have one or 
the other.We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement with the referenced 
Counterparty dated 10/26/00.  Copies will be distributed.Nikki,

How do we dial that number from the US?  Is there a particular country code 
we have to use?

Stacy needs to talk with her to decide if it's appropriate to trade under the 
GISB.  If she agrees, we shouldn't need to amend the ETA -- the GISB will 
become an "applicable master" under the terms of the ETA and all nat gas 
transactions eligible for trading under the GISB would be confirmed under the 
GISB contract, to the extent the nat gas group sends confirms.  Give Denise a 
call back and let her know to expect a call from Stacy.

Stacy:

Please all this woman and discuss her request re the GISB agreement.  Then, 
give me a call so that we can discuss your determination and to make sure I

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  You 
should have edit access (non-Legal or Credit employees can get view access 
only.  They should not see our comments.  That information is confidential 
and subject to attorney/client privilege).   Let me know if you do not have 
edit access.  Please do not edit entries for companies or agreements outside 
your area of responsibility.  A few notes...

There is some great reporting functionality in this database.  Check out some 
of the sorts on the left.  There is a drop down called "Pending Swap 
Update".  That sort will create a list of all executed and draft financial 
agreements.  There are ways you can sort the Pending Swap Update to generate 
reports for you compan

The "restrictions" column should be limited to only those issues that are 
critical to trading/confirmations/settlement.  Kinda, before you do/authorize 
a trade read this.  Not for general legal notes.  

Once an agreement's status is coded "executed", it should never be coded 
elsewise (it will mess up reporting).  If you are amending an agreement or 
superseding and replacing one, code the status "executed-under amendment".

 I should be the only one coded to change the "keywords" in the drop downs.  
If you need keywords added, send me an email and I will add them for you.  

Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

Last week Tana and I discussed geeting the Australian ISDA Masrer Agreements 
loaded onto the the international data base. I already have access to this 
data base through Lotus Notes.

The agreed actions were

Tana would arrange for Alison, Rob and myself to have update and view access.
Tana would work with Alison on getting existing Australian ISDAs loaded up 
and explaining functionality.

Tana how are we going with access? We can then get things moving.  



When you have a minute to review this, can we meet so you can handle this 
response to Anthony.  Thanks.

Tana,

Per our last discussion, could you please verify the Contracts listed below 
in the following attachment along with their corresponding Confirming 
Entities?  These results shall be given, along with the other list of 
Agreements that have been researched, to Bob Bowen.

Thank You,
Anthony



When you get back into the office, can we visit about updating the ENA 
resolutions re: confirmation signatories.  I think we need to clean out some 
of the data in the Corporate Database re:  confirmation signatories.

Thanks!Fred,

Per our conversation, this link will get you access into the Master Swap 
Agreement database, where you can look up the status of any master 
agreement.  If you have some time, why don't you take a look at it and see if 
your group would find this helpful.

A few news flashes re: limitations on products:

1.  The only parties that can trade Argentina physical gas are Argentina 
counterparties.  They have licensing requirements similar to US physical 
power.  All existing counterparties that are not Argentinian should be shut 
down for this product.
2.  Mark Taylor just found out in a meeting with the tax guys that only ENA

Tana-

Here are the companies that we are currently talking with that require an 
NDA.  I believe that all of these are covered under NDA via EBS.

I assume it's common practice to have to go through this process due to our 
group's move from one company to another, but have been asked by one of our 
originators if there's a way to work around it;  the point being that it's an 
inconvenience to the counterparty to jump through another hoop because of our 
situation.  

Let me know if there's anything I can do to help you!

I was asked to contact you regarding your proposed confidentiality
agreement.

As drafted, we think the confidentiality agreement is overly broad, and
potentially could limit our ability to speak with and participate in other
ECNs.  Consequently, I suggest that we create a definition as to what items
specifically constitute confidential information, and attach a list of those
items as a schedule to the agreement.  Using this methodology, we prevent
putting ourselves in the position where we need to worry about the broad
definition currently contained in your agreement every time we speak with a
competing ECN.

If you wish to discuss this matter further, I can be reached at (212)
566-9647.

		 Subject: Springs SWAP Confirmations


From a Credit perspective, I informed Allison that credit provisions are not 
required for these particular deals since I learned of the trades 2 days ago 
(after the deals had been executed without our approval upfront).   Credit 
believes it does not make sense to execute stand alone financial deals.  
These deals should be executed as amendments to the pricing component of the 
physical contracts (i.e., a restructuring).  This process would mitigate the 
operational, credit and legal risks of this proposed business.  My 
understanding of the business strategy of EES is to enter into financial 
transactions to hedge the portfolio, not to execute financial trades with end 
users.  Please advise if the legal position is changing.

Assuming we are unable to achieve the aforementioned solution, these deals 
raise more significant issues regarding support and control of new business 
endeavors for EES which already has significant infrastructure and control 
issues.  It raises issues to be resolved on:

Credit approval and monitoring
Credit provisions
Legal support in EES with financial and ISDA experience
Netting issues and additional credit risk from having multiple masters with 
our clients (physical and financial)
Execution of masters post trade execution
Capturing and monitoring these OTC financial trades separate from financial 
settlements of physical trades
Managing portfolio position risk
Operational issues capturing and properly valuing the trades
Operational support for confirmations and ensuring timely execution


In short, we need to establish processes to support this business.  I will 
set up a meeting with relevant parties to discuss further.

In respect to the attached confirmations for Springs, additional questions 
should be raised with regard to operational/billing and legal implications 
for consolidated billing of financial and physical invoices.  This has been 
specified in the payment date.  Is EES capable of accomplishing this 
operationally today?  Doesn't this raise legal issues of consolidated billing 
and settlements under two different contracts which do not stipulate netting 
(physical with financial)?

Regards
Molly

Subject: Merger of NationsBank and Bank of America - Enron Corp.

Re:  Enron Corp.

 We have received a letter agreement from Bank of America setting forth the 
terms of the referenced merger as they relate to our ISDA Master Agreements 
currently in place with Enron Corp. and each of  Bank of America and 
NationsBank.  Credit and Legal have agreed to the terms set forth therein.
 
1. On July 5, 1999, NationsBank, N.A. ("NationsBank") changed its name to 
Bank of America, N.A.
2. On July 23, 1999, Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association 
("BofA") merged with Bank of America,  N.A. and the surviving bank is named 
Bank of America, National Association.

Effective July 23, 1999, as a result of the merger, the following will 
occurr:  

1. The ISDA Master Agreement, dated February 8, 1995,  between Enron Corp. 
and  and NationsBank, N.A.  will remain in place.  Bank of America, National 
Association as successor by merger, shall be our counterparty.

2. The ISDA Master Agreement, dated February 4, 1994 and effective as of 
August 14, 1992,  between Enron Corp. and Bank of America National Savings 
and Trust Association  is terminated.  Any existing trades under this 
agreement shall be transferred to the ISDA  Agreement under number 1 above.

 A copy of the letter agreement will be distributed.

I spoke to Ed Sacks in Credit re: AEP.  We have an ISDA in place with AEP 
Energy Services, Inc.  When they trade under that master they are trading for 
their own account.  When they trade as American Electric Power Service 
Corporation they are actually trading as the service company for the family 
of utilities under their umbrella.  So it's 2 different counterparties.We had the attached agreement executed by each of Enron North America, Enron 
Canada and Enron Power Marketing.

 This is to invite you to the annual Litigation Unit In-house Ethics CLE

An open bar will be available from 4:30-5:00 p.m.; the presentation will take 
place from 5:00-6:00 p.m.; and there will be a post-presentation open bar

this presentation.  We will be videotaping it for the use of those who 
schedules do not permit them to attend.  As always, this is at no cost to 
you.

Tana-

Here are the companies that we are currently talking with that require an 
NDA.  I believe that all of these are covered under NDA via EBS.

I assume it's common practice to have to go through this process due to our 
group's move from one company to another, but have been asked by one of our 
originators if there's a way to work around it;  the point being that it's an 
inconvenience to the counterparty to jump through another hoop because of our 
situation.  

Let me know if there's anything I can do to help you!

I assume you have heard that EOL is soliciting HoustonStreet.com and 
QuickQuote.com in order to 
increase their volume and market coverage.  The message below is from Ron 
Nolte, our IT person
for the confirmation systems.  I think he is asking some very pertinent 
questions that may need your
legal opinion.

I guess my fear is that you have not been included in the conversations and 
set-up of EOL's discussions
with HoustonStreet.com and QuickQuote.com.

To: Bob Bowen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Torrey 
Moorer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Johnson/Corp/Enron@Enron
cc:  
Subject: City Streets


Just came back from a meeting in which Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny and Torrey 
Moorer informed everyone about the new venture 
between HoustonStreet.Com and Enron and QuickQuote.com and Enron.   In 90 
days, HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com will be offering products offered 
on EOL.

I solicit comments from everyone.

As I understand it, a party wishing to trade gas and power can log onto 
HoustonStreet.Com and  deals offered on EOL will 
magically appear. The party might think, "Hey, I can't do better than this on 
EOL, I'll take this deal".  The deal is transacted   
and HoustonStreet.Com number is assigned.  As soon as the "Do the Deal"  
button is clicked, the transaction is sent to EOL where
it is validated.  An EOL deal number is assigned but as far as the party 
doing the deal is concerned, the deal is a HoustonStreet.Com deal.

In the case of a gas deal,  the deal will be bridged to both Sitara and 
TAGG.  The deal at this point would have four deal numbers:

  HoustonStreet.Com Deal #
  EOL Deal #
  Sitara Deal #
  TAGG Deal #

Based on the meeting, the following requirements surfaced.  If you are in 
TAGG,  you should be able to access the deal using
HoustonStreet.Com  Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the TAGG Deal #.

If you are in DCAF II,  you should be able to access the deal using 
HoustonStreet.Com Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the Sitara Deal #.

This requirement implies that the capture windows in TAGG and Sitara ( I 
assume ) will need to be changed to capture both
the HoustonStreet.Com Deal # and EOL Deal #.  The TAGG Deal number itself  is 
assigned by the Capture program.

This will require a database change as well as fairly significant ( it was 
assumed that there is only one "Originating System")  program modifications 
to TAGG Deal Capture, TAGG Deal Clearing,  DCAF II, and Enpower Autoconfirm ( 
clears Power deals ).

Now for some issues:

1) Who is the internal party on the deal that is to appear on the 
confirmation?  Whichever Enron entity  offers that product on EnronOnline 
will be the party for these trades as well.  Will a HoustonStreet.Com and
 a QuickQuote internal party be set up in Global Counterparty?  

 There are implications for Global Counterparty since all address information 
is set up based on who the external party is doing business with.

 In other words, if there are new internal parties, the address information 
set up for these same external  parties that do trades on EOL will
 have to be set up again for doing business with the new internal parties.

2) Is the confirm to sport a HoustonStreet.Com logo and a QuickQuote.com 
logo? No.  The confirms may reference the platform on which the trade was 
done but otherwise it should look just like a regular Enron confirmation.

3) Who is to sign the confirmation letters when signatures are required?  
Same process as exists for EnronOnline transactions.

4) Contract numbers will have to be set up just as they are for trading under 
EOL.  But who are the contracts between?  If
 new internal parties are set up for HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com, 
then contracts will have to be set up
 between the new internal parties.  But since a HoustonStreet.Com deal goes 
through EOL, how will the appropriate
 contract be assigned?; i.e., if Koch does a deal through HoustonStreet.Com, 
is  a different contract assigned 
 in EOL versus if Koch does the deal through EOL itself? Seems to me it 
should be the same - we only have one agreement with Koch.



 












We have received the following executed documents from counterparty:

1.  First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated as of 04/27/99 between ECT 
and Engage Energy US, L.P. (i) making certain changes to setoff provisions 
and (ii) changing Counterparty's exposure threshold; and

2.  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) between ECT Canada and 
Engage Energy Canada, L.P. executed 05/03/99, effective as of 01/31/97.

online.  She said she spoke to counterparty and they are a distribution 
company and not FERC approved to sell power.  So we will not change that 
profile.I am looking for the merger documents dated 12/30/99 wherein Devon Energy 
Corp. merged with Devon Energy Production Company, L.P., and PennzEnergy

These are all Enron Online deals.  Evidently, the Coral traders are logging

Re: Navajo Tribal Utility Authority:  Per Leslie, not a FERC approved

Leslie spoke to Dinanna Dechilly at the authority and they are not interested

I take it you signed off on this new product.  It is pretty common that we 
just copy the profile for a similar product for the existing 1500-2000 
counterparties.  Let me know if you think this is a problem.

Just an update on the status of the signing.  As of Friday, Duke supposedly 
had signed their documents but wouldn't fax them over because they didn't 
like the certificate that Enron Corp. provided with respect to the guaranty.  
Clement Abrams,  Enron Corp.'s lawyer, spoke to Duke's lawyer this morning 
and is preparing an additional certificate that should address their 
concerns.  He is getting it signed and will then fax it directly to them and 
give me the original for transmittal.  I'll keep you posted on how things 
progress...OK for me.

Subject: Norwegian Contracts

Philippe has uncovered a group of contracts in Norwegian that are not 
translated in English at all.  Here is his note :

Norwegian Power Contracts have not been translated into English.  This has 
not been an issue for the Power Deal Clearing and Documentation Group because 
Ellen Wallumrod is from Norway.  She is able to make 'confirms' in her native 
tongue.  However, this is an issue from Global Contracts because no one can 
speak Norwegian! 
I have spoken with translation companies regarding translation fees.  It is 
very costly to have all of the contracts translated.  There are perhaps a 
dozen contracts.  Should legal cover the translation expenses?  Ian believes 
that only parts of the contract need to be translated.  But, how do I know 
which parts need to be translated?  And, with Auditors in mind, shouldn't we 
have English copies on hand?






Do we need to have a complete English version ?

If not, would it be acceptable to translate only certain paragraphs ?

Should we (Global Contracts) target building a multi-lingual staff for the 
future - esp. in London office ?

Got any ideas or opinions ?


I'm talking to their lawyer right now.  He's checking with his power team to 
find out what name their FERC license is in.  However, we still do not have a 
Credit sign off on power yet, so I am also working with ("nagging") the power 
Credit person to get me some headroom.  Let's just say ANP is "evolving" as 
we speak!

US Legal would have no problem doing business with a Connecticut limited 
liability company (subject, of course, to Credit approval).  There are some 
legal considerations with respect to certain products.  In order to trade any 
financial products the counterparty would have to meet the U.S. "eligible 
swap participant" standards (which sets certain asset and net worth levels) 
and to trade U.S. power they would need to have a FERC license.  Otherwise, 
we have no problem with limited liability companies.

In Justin's absence, please could you let me know if we would be able to 
consider an application from a Limited Liability Company organized under the 
laws of the State of Connecticut, USA?  If possible, could you provide me 
with an answer on this today or latest tomorrow as this customer is coming in 
to the office on Thursday?  The history behind this customer is that the 
original company that Mr Papaeconomou wanted to trade under (NEWCO) was 
incorporated in Liberia.  As we do not have the relevant documentation to 
support trading from Liberia we rejected his application.  This would be a 
good customer for Andy James (Seafreight) to get online and Mr Papaeconomou 
is obviously very keen to obtain execute access as soon as possible through a 
viable company.

before or after my appointment, I would very much appreciate to meet you in

would now be solved!)

Can we open up ANP for gas ASAP.  They have been dying to trade.  They want 
to trade power but so far Credit has not given them any headroom for power 
and they do not appear to have a FERC license in this name.  We are working

We do have an ISDA Agreement in place between Koch Energy Trading and ENA, 
but Anthony is correct on a number of accounts.  First, we could not put Oslo 
trades under this master.  It is a Local Currency form and could not be used 
for any non US transaction. Second, it is quite old and our forms have 
evolved since then and we would not want to replicate this form.  Lastly, it 
has the old "ERMS" style collateral annex, and we would want to use an ISDA 
Credit Support Annex on a going forward basis.  I would suggest contacting 
Matt Dawson in London Legal and Rod Nelson in London Credit and getting a new 
master based off our current form.

Hi Yumi,

Yes I realise the entities are going to be different if this turns out to be 
a ENA ISDA but the by already having an ISDA with the counterparty we can 
quicken the negotiation process, i.e. 'mirroring' the contract as you say, 
and having the correct entities in place. Thats what I am proposing we do. 
This is something we'll need to work with Martin on.

Thanks

Matthew

Hi Matt,

I believe we may need to set up a new ISDA since ECTRIC is a different entity 
than ENA.  In the past we have mirrored an existing ENA ISDA in order to 
create one between the CP and ECTRIC.  However, I'll wait to turn in any 
requests until I hear what we already have with Koch.

Thank you,
Yumi

Hi Anthony,

Can you do me a favour and take a look into this ISDA. The traders in our 
Oslo office have done a weather deal with Koch Energy Trading Inc.  The 
counterparty mentioned they had an ISDA in place with ECTRIC. We are trading 
as ECTRIC.   But maybe the CP was confused and thought it was ECTRIC instead 
of ENA.

The trader here said she plans to do many more future trades with Koch, and 
has been asking if we can amend the ENA ISDA to cover Oslo.

If you can just confirm what you've got, whats covered etc and if possible 
send through a copy and I can liaise with Oslo and our legal dept to get them 
covered.

Thanks

Matthew

Matt,

I spoke to Matthew Dawson, and he said there is an old ISDA out there, with 
an effective & contract date of 23 May 1994 with ECT.
It was apparently negotiated in Houston, and the contact there is Tana Jones.

There is no copy here in London, but Matt said he would ask Tana, if we could 
see one.

I also noticed the ISDA memo, and was rooting around looking for the 
attachments that went with it, and couldn't find them.  There was also a few 
updates in a second memo there to some country opinions.  If and when Mark 
calls in I was going to ask him if he knows where the attachments went, 
because the one will cost $100 if we have to order it.A fellow from Western Publishing Company called Anthony Camppos in Global 
Contracts and said something to the effect that that wanted to terminate the 
master with us and trade(s) thereunder.  He referenced Deal No. EK9839.1.  
I'm not sure by this note if the company is being liquidated or just this 
trades, but you might want to give them a call.  Jim McClymont at (308)

Miss Tana,

Are you interested in going to the Nutcracker Market this Saturday morning
and being there for the early bird special (8 a.m.)??  It costs $25 to get
in early, but that covers $10 admission, $5 parking, coffee and
refreshments.  Otherwise, you can go at 10 a.m., pay $10 to get in with the
rest of the crowd and $5 for parking.  I think I am going to plan to be
there around 7:40-7:45.  Let me know if you are interested.

We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement dated October 31, 
2000 between webMethods, Inc. and Enron North America Corp., Enron Net Works 
LLC and EnronOnline, LLC.  A copy will be sent to Dovie Keprta.We have a really old agreement with the referenced counterparty and I don't 
think we use it to trade under anymore.  I spoke to the Confirm Desk and it 
appears all of our trading is under Dynegy Marketing and Trade.  If you 
concur, I would like to inactive that master, since I'm afraid it might get 
attached for online trading.?

(713) 853-6121Per my conv. w/Tanya, the above master should be inactived (which I have 
already done in Lotus Notes) and taken off the executed Master List.  All the 
Dynegy Trading is done out of Dynegy Marketing and Trade.

Thanks.Peter, I hate to say, but I had the same thought earlier this morning.  Is 
there not one thing we can do in this country without having a lawyer in the 
middle of it.  We've all lost our common sense and direction.

It sure makes for good TV, though!  I sat all last night flipping from news 
station to news station getting their spin on what's going on.  I can't say 
I've ever paid this much attention to a presidential election before.  I've 
been telling everybody your spin on the electoral college and the 3 party 
system.  That was a good thought.

Robert Jones appears to be a VP of Enron Net Works, but not EnronOnline. 

By copy of this email to Deb Korkmas, I would like to confirm that the above 
is correct, and if it is, can we please get Robert Jones added as a VP of 
EnronOnline.

Thanks!

Tana:

Does Robert Jones, HR VP, have signatory authority for Net Works and 
EnronOnline?   Per Michelle Cash, he needs it since he signs employment 
contracts, ect.  If he does not, we'll need to have some retroactive 
resolutions prepared.

Please let me know.

emailed Tana JonesSara Shackleton, an attorney in our group, is drafting some language that we 
will be proposing to Deutsche Bank in response to their request that we add 
the Enron companies they do financial business with to the definition of 
"Specified Entity".   We have some concern that by adding certain Enron 
entities to Specified Entity, a default in a swap transaction could possibly 
default certain structured loan transactions with a swap component, and we 
are trying to carve those transactions out.  

Sara is also working on the FUNB agreement.  I checked with her and the FUNB 
agreement we had been working from was so old that we agreed to start from 
the latest form of our agreement, so Sara sent Dee Travella at FUNB a revised 
draft on 11/8/00.  Sara's direct phone no. is 713/853-5620.

the ISDA Schedule is in the hands of Deutsche Bank and I need them to turn
around the revised draft.  I'm still working on it.

Thanks for this.  It would be very helpful if you could send me the latest
versions of the Guarantee and the Schedule just indicating which is the
only
outstanding point.  That way we can prepare the versions for
EnronCredit.com
Limited based on these and get things as close to finalised pending the
outcome of this last credit point that you refer to.

My fax number is 0207 330 9999.

Many thanks for your assistance.

The lawyer up at Enron Corp. just called me and said he just got off the
phone w/Deutsche Bank and they have come to an agreement as to the proposed
form of guaranty.  We have one more credit issue on the master that Credit
would like us to revisit with them, but otherwise I think we close to being

you need with Enron Corp., I will be happy to assist you.

Jennifer McQuade with EOL called checking on the status of your conv. 
w/Elzear Lemieux with cpy.  Have you resolved the ETA questions yet?I checked w/Mark Taylor, and he can't approve me going to Calgary until he 
checks it with Mark Haedicke to see if it's OK, which he won't do until he 
gets back in town, which is in two weeks.  I hope that isn't going to cause 
any problems...

I actually received the last document I need to put otgether binders this 
week.  Linda and I will compile closing binders with all the relevant 
documents next week and send you one set for your files.  I will send copies 
of the RBC documents to Rick at the same time.

So, when are you going to come and enjoy our crisp weather?  Mark Taylor 
e-mailed me saying he thought it was a good idea for you to come up here to 
train Linda and Sharon.  It ain't Stampede, but at least Peter and I can 
return the hospitality.

My favorite election comment to date comes from Gore who said today he was 
not "focused on the contest, but our democracy".  Such a thoughtful, selfless 
person!For this list of amends, my comments mean:

Cinergy-already had them open for financial & power, Credit's changes should 
have no impact on my prior approvals.
Dynegy Power Marketing-shut them down for financial (& Argentina gas)
Nui Energy Brokers-already had them open for all financial, OK with Credit's 
changes.

polls."

GCP does have the correct name on file. The company changed its name from 
Cyprus Amax Coal Corporation to RAG American Coal Sales Company and then to 
RAG Coal Sales of America. I had talked to the legal when I first found out 
and provided Cheryl Johnson in Global SAP, with all the name change 
documents. You may contact her at x33103 in order to request 
those........................Adnan

Can you check on the name of RAG American Coal Sales Company.  We have a note 
in our Financial Trading Agreement database that pursuant to a Certificate of 
Amendment filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, RAG American Coal Sales 
Company further changed its name to RAG Coal Sales of America, Inc. on 
4/6/2000.  Our file is missing so I cannot find the hard copy of the name 
change.  Thanks.

Your call to Mark Taylor in Houston Legal was forwarded to me for response.  
Mark is on vacation in Germany until the end of next week.  Per your 
voicemail, you has some US market descriptions that you need to have 
reviewed.  I just left Mark a voicemail on his cell phone, I'm not sure if I 
will hear from him tonight or not.  If youcould email or fax me the 
document/information you need reviewed, I will run it by Mark as soon as I 
hear back from him.  I'm sorry I can't be of more help for the immediate 
moment, but I will respond as soon as I hear from Mark. Can you fax me the merger documents to 646-3490.  Thanks!

Its NOT a name change, the Two calpine companies are merging and the survivor 
company is Calpine Energy Services. Calpine Power record will be inactivated 
on the 1st of next month. Merger docs had been forwarded to you. If not give 
Cheryl Johnson a call and she can forward that.

For RAG......At the time I sent out the spreadsheet in order to meet the EOL 
deadline the GCP system showed the old name. Now the system had been updated 
by Cheryl to reflect the correct name. For further details, on that contact 
Karen Lambert since we have to send the spreadsheet out ASAP everyday to her, 
by a certain time, with the information as it appears in GCP.

P.S. Check in GCP System since thats the most updated information you can 
find. If a name change, merger or acquisition is in process, CHERYL JOHNSON 
or MARILYN COLBERT would know best why?

GCP does have the correct name on file. The company changed its name from

RAG Coal Sales of America. I had talked to the legal when I first found out 
and provided Cheryl Johnson in Global SAP, with all the name change

		 Subject: Nice VP and possibly Pres.

When I look at Al Gore I continue to be amazed that one, let alone 50 
million, Americans voted for him.  Both Clinton's and Gore's continued 
shamelessness, and disregard for doing the right and decent thing, is only 
slightly less amazing than the American people (or at least half of them) 
continuing to find reasons to support them.  My only, yet substantive, vested 
interest in the outcome is that we are inundated with US T.V. and I can't 
bear the thought of looking at Gore (and God forbid Hillary) for the next 
four years.  If they don't settle this Florida thing, I am going to have it 
have my cable disconnected.

We vote in our federal election on November 27th.  We will not have any such 
problems however - not because we are any better than anyone (in fact, I am 
not entirely confident that most of my fellow Canadians will understand, or 
have ever have understood, the ballot or voted for who they thought they were 
voting for) - but rather because of the political system which Jon's 
ancestors were so kind to bestow upon us, which I refer to as "parliamentary 
dictatorship''. 

(Sorry Tana if you are a Democrat, but that is the independent middle of the 
road - yeah right - view of a Canadian observer.  Jon, I cannot, however, 
apologize for the political ruin which your system of Government has brought 
upon us, other to acknowledge that the problem my not be the system but 
rather our screwed up regionalization of your unified parliamentary system 
into 11 separate parliamentary systems - and I suppose that could be 
construed as an apology of sorts, except, for the record, I will never 
apologize to you for anything until you make a public, i.e. to Tana and me by 
e-mail, confession of your sins on San Felipe.  For that matter, you are as 
bad as Clinton and Gore.)

Peter.
As you requested, to clear up any confusion regarding the responsibilities of 
the paralegals in the financial trading group:

We have four paralegals, myself, Susan Bailey, Samantha Boyd and Stephanie 
Panus.  Marie Heard is no longer is our group, she works for Enron 
Broadband.  Below are responsibilities of the paralegals in our group:

Tana Jones:  Primarily all EnronOnline issues.  (1) I am the primary Legal 
contact for counterparty approvals for all Legal Groups.  Individual contract 
problems should be sorted out with the relevant Legal group (i.e. physical 
gas, power, etc.) the same way as they would be resolved offline.  (2) As my 
time allows, I try and help on ISDA negotiations, so if you see a master with 
my name on, feel free to call me.

Day to Day Financial Contract Drafting and Questions:  Can be directed to any 
of Susan, Samantha, or Stephanie.

Copies of Executed Masters:  Call our assistant, Taffy Milligan at x57373, 
she can get you copies.

Merger/Name Changes:  Stephanie Panus

Executed Master List:  Susan Bailey

This Counterparty is on the 11/9/00 EOL List.  We have received documentation 
that reflects that Calpine Power Services Company, an entity where we have an 
ISDA Master in place, has merged with and into Calpine Energy Services, L.P., 
an entity where we don't have an ISDA in place with.   Is Credit OK with this 
merger?I am sending down this list, with all counterparties approved except Calpine, 
which I am still waiting on Credit approval on the Calpine Power 
Services/Energy Services merger.  As soon as I get their sign off I will send 
down an amended spreadsheet.
Pursuant to the Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware Secretary of 
State effective 11/1/00, Calpine Power Services Company, a California 
corporation has been merged with and into Calpine Energy Services, L.P., a 
Delaware corporation.  The ISDA Master Agreement with Calpine Power Services 
Company dated 10/20/99 will be changed accordingly.Per a call from Rod today, our executed master list hasn't picked up the 
following name change:  Lomak Petroleum Inc. to Range Resources Corporation.

Thanks!Nope, it's a merger.

clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a
much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the
press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of
the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the
Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. "The fact remains that

claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won
the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.

"It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees," said

Hi Tana -

We are trying to put in place an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron

I have prepared the following documents but not sure if they are most up to 
date:

1. Certificate of Assistant Secretary

2. Certificate of Secretary

3. Unanimous Consent of Directors (this is incomplete cos I am not sure of 
the part starting from RESOLVED ..)


Is there any other documents that I have missed out?  Would appreciate your

anything incorrect, please guide me accordingly.

Per Mark's request, can we rename the headings on two charts with our gross 
numbers to match my list:  "Net long or short position in all months 
combined" should be the net of our aggregate position, and "Gross Long or 
Short Position" should be our gross position on either side of the market, 
with the positions not netted out.At the request of Mark Taylor, can you get Sara Shackleton and Brent Hendry 
passwords too so they can review the Dynegydirect GTC's.  P.S.  Do we have 
any particular deadline for getting them approved?  

Thanks!

I'm afraid I'm still none the wiser . Anyway , points of history : (1) Yes , 
we did , technically , lose the American War of Independence but it was 
because we got sick of it and had other "fish to fry" in Asia and Africa , 
plus it was really a civil war because the people who "beat" us were , 
largely , first or second generation "Americans" and , therefore ,  Brits 
(for example , George Washington's family home is still there close to my 
home town of Sunderland in North-East England ) and (2) we never lost to the 
French , we agreed to give them the worst bit - Quebec - in return for some 
tastier possessions elsewhere .

Subject: Re: Nice VP and possibly Pres.  

That fact that you asked "who?" begs the further question of what exactly you 
were up to in Houston.  Have the Brits ever really won a battle any way?  
(Their failure to beat a bunch of colonized farmers with pitch forks has 
resulted directly in this Florida mess, and their failure to put away the 
French (of all people) has resulted directly in me and the vast majority of 
my fellow Canadians being subjected to official and legally mandated 
bilingualism).

To the point, I believe San Felipe is the battle field adjacent to the 
Westheimer battle field, where the Brits (or at least one of them) were 
purportedly waging a more efficient war, until being caught red handed on the 
battle fields of San Felipe, where, all the while, the Canadian forces (or at 
least one of them) were so successfully conquering the enemy.

Peter.

Subject: Nice VP and possibly Pres.

When I look at Al Gore I continue to be amazed that one, let alone 50 
million, Americans voted for him.  Both Clinton's and Gore's continued 
shamelessness, and disregard for doing the right and decent thing, is only 
slightly less amazing than the American people (or at least half of them) 
continuing to find reasons to support them.  My only, yet substantive, vested 
interest in the outcome is that we are inundated with US T.V. and I can't 
bear the thought of looking at Gore (and God forbid Hillary) for the next 
four years.  If they don't settle this Florida thing, I am going to have it 
have my cable disconnected.

We vote in our federal election on November 27th.  We will not have any such 
problems however - not because we are any better than anyone (in fact, I am 
not entirely confident that most of my fellow Canadians will understand, or 
have ever have understood, the ballot or voted for who they thought they were 
voting for) - but rather because of the political system which Jon's 
ancestors were so kind to bestow upon us, which I refer to as "parliamentary 
dictatorship''. 

(Sorry Tana if you are a Democrat, but that is the independent middle of the 
road - yeah right - view of a Canadian observer.  Jon, I cannot, however, 
apologize for the political ruin which your system of Government has brought 
upon us, other to acknowledge that the problem my not be the system but 
rather our screwed up regionalization of your unified parliamentary system 
into 11 separate parliamentary systems - and I suppose that could be 
construed as an apology of sorts, except, for the record, I will never 
apologize to you for anything until you make a public, i.e. to Tana and me by 
e-mail, confession of your sins on San Felipe.  For that matter, you are as 
bad as Clinton and Gore.)

Peter.












Per the request of Sara, I am attaching Annex A and Annex B to the Omnibus 
Confirmation for the referenced counterparty.

I believe that this was authored by James Carville:


NEW YORK (AP) --The New York Mets announced today that they are going to
court to get an additional inning added to the end of Game 5 of the World
Series. The batting, pitching, and bench coaches for the Mets held a press
conference earlier today.  They were joined by members of the Major League
Players Union. "We meant to hit those pitches from the Yankee pitchers,"
said the Mets batting coach.  "We were confused by the irregularities of the
pitches we received and believe we have been denied our right to hit."

One claim specifically noted that a small percentage of the Mets batters had
intended to swing at fast balls, but actually swung at curve balls. It was
clear that these batters never intended to swing at curve balls, though a
much higher percentage were not confused by the pitches. Reporters at the
press conference pointed out that the Mets had extensively reviewed film of
the Yankees pitchers prior to the World Series and had in fact faced the
Yankees in inter-league play earlier in the year. "The fact remains that
some of the pitches confused us and denied us of our right to hit," said the 
Mets
batting coach. "The World Series is not over yet and the Yankees are
celebrating prematurely."Major League Baseball has reviewed the telecast of
all the World Series games and recounted the balls and strikes called by the
umpires of each game. "While some of the strikes called against the Mets
were, in fact, balls, there were not enough of them to change the outcome of
the World Series," the commissioner said. Another portion of the Mets legal
claim stated that, based on on-base percentage, the Mets had actually won
the World Series, regardless of the final scores of the games.

"It's clear that we were slightly on-base more often than the Yankees," said

a Mets spokesman.  "The World Series crown is rightly ours."The manager of
the Mets has remained in relative seclusion, engaging in some light jogging
for exercise.  He has stated that he believes "we need to let the process
run its course without a rush to judgment."

Mark Taylor has asked me to forward the attached email to each of you.  Per 
Mark's direction and the email, we need to sign off, from a Legal (not 
business) perspective only, on the attached descriptions of the 12 product 
areas to be traded online.  So far we have only received 5 of the referenced 
12 descriptions.  I will forward the additional descriptions to the relevant 
Legal group when I receive them.  Per the attached email, Awais needs our 
Legal sign off by Friday.

I understand Alan may be out for the rest of the week so the attached 
descriptions on Coal, SO2 and NOX will need to be approved by someone else in 
his group.  I'm not sure who that would be.  Could you let me know?  Mark 
asked if Shari and Sara could sign off on the weather and pulp & paper 
description for our group.

Thanks for your help!

Tana,

I am afraid there is more than one description.  Some are quite lengthy,  US 
West Power (11 Pages) and US Natural Gas (5 pages).  There is a quite urgent 
deadline to get these uploaded into the web pages and then integrated into 
the site by the end of this week.  So any comments you can provide ASAP would 
be much appreciated.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to phone, or email me.  Tel

Thanks

Steven & Carol,

I am working for Louise Kitchen on the EnronOnline project.  As part of the 
site we are incorporating market descriptions of all the main market that we 
will be trading on the system to give users some general information.

I have collected and rewritten these into a standard format and am currently 
in the process of obtaining Legal and regulatory approval of these 
descriptions that will be visible to anyone on the web.

In Total there are 12 descriptions covering North Amercia.  These are listed 
below.

Canada Gas
LPG
NOx Emissions
Oil & Oil products
Plastics and Petrochemicals
Pulp & Paper
SO2 Emissions
US Coal
US Natural Gas
US East Power
US West Power
Weather Derivatives

I have below the completed descriptions to date.  Please could you pass to 
the respective people in your groups for their review and comments.  I would 
appreciate it if you could provide your comments as soonas possible as these 
have to be approved and loaded into the web site this week.  

Below are 5 of the descriptions.  I shall send the remainder to yourselves 
tomorrow.



If you have any questions my telephone number in London is  44 171 970 7377.

Thanks

Awais

NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE

To the citizens of the United States of America,

In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to 
govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your 
independence,effective today.

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over 
all states, commonwealths and other territories.  Except Utah, which she does 
not fancy.  Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 
97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside 
your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for 
further elections.Congress and the Senate will be disbanded.  A questionnaire 
will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.

To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules 
are introduced with immediate effect:

1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then 
look up "aluminium".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You will be amazed at 
just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise 
your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up "vocabulary".  Using the same 
twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you 
know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.  Look up
"interspersed".

2. There is no such thing as "US English".  We will let Microsoft know on 
your behalf.

3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.  It 
really isn't that hard.

4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good 
guys.

5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The Queen",but 
only after fully carrying out task 1.  We would not want you to get confused 
and give up half way through.

6. You should stop playing American "football".  There is only one kind of 
football.  What you refer to as American "football" is not a very good game. 
The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may 
have noticed that no one else plays "American" football.  You will no longer 
be allowed to play it, and should
instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with 
the girls.  It is a difficult game.  Those of you brave enough will, in time, 
be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American "football", but does 
not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar 
body armour like nancies).We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby 
sevens side by 2005.

7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they 
give you any merde.  The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a 
world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky.  The Russians have 
never been the bad guys."Merde" is French for "sh*t".

8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday.  November 8th will be a new 
national holiday, but only in England.  It will be called "Indecisive Day".

9. All American cars are hereby banned.  They are crap and it is for your own 
good.  When we show you German cars,  you will understand what we mean.

10. Please tell us who killed JFK.  It's been driving us crazy.

Thank you for your cooperation.

5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The Queen",but 
only after fully carrying out task 1.  We would not want you to get confused 
and give up half way through.

6. You should stop playing American "football".  There is only one kind of 
football.  What you refer to as American "football" is not a very good game. 
The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may 
have noticed that no one else plays "American" football.  You will no longer 
be allowed to play it, and should
instead play proper football. Initially, it would be best if you played with 
the girls.  It is a difficult game.  Those of you brave enough will, in time, 
be allowed to play rugby (which is similar to American "football", but does 
not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar 
body armour like nancies).We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby 
sevens side by 2005.

7. You should declare war on Quebec and France, using nuclear weapons if they 
give you any merde.  The 98.85% of you who were not aware that there is a 
world outside your borders should count yourselves lucky.  The Russians have 
never been the bad guys."Merde" is French for "sh*t".

8. July 4th is no longer a public holiday.  November 8th will be a new 
national holiday, but only in England.  It will be called "Indecisive Day".

9. All American cars are hereby banned.  They are crap and it is for your own 
good.  When we show you German cars,  you will understand what we mean.

10. Please tell us who killed JFK.  It's been driving us crazy.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Subject: FW: Notice of Revocation of Independence


NOTICE OF REVOCATION OF INDEPENDENCE

To the citizens of the United States of America,

In the light of your failure to elect a President of the USA and thus to 
govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your 
independence,effective today.

Her Sovereign Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will resume monarchial duties over 
all states, commonwealths and other territories.  Except Utah, which she does 
not fancy.  Your new prime minister (The rt. hon. Tony Blair, MP for the 
97.85% of you who have until now been unaware that there is a world outside 
your borders) will appoint a minister for America without the need for 
further elections.Congress and the Senate will be disbanded.  A questionnaire 
will be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.

To aid in the transition to a British Crown Dependency, the following rules 
are introduced with immediate effect:

1. You should look up "revocation" in the Oxford English Dictionary. Then 
look up "aluminium".  Check the pronunciation guide.  You will be amazed at 
just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it. Generally, you should raise 
your vocabulary to acceptable levels. Look up "vocabulary".  Using the same 
twenty seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you 
know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.  Look up
"interspersed".

2. There is no such thing as "US English".  We will let Microsoft know on 
your behalf.

3. You should learn to distinguish the English and Australian accents.  It 
really isn't that hard.

4. Hollywood will be required occasionally to cast English actors as the good 
guys.

5. You should relearn your original national anthem, "God Save The Queen",but 
only after fully carrying out task 1.  We would not want you to get confused 
and give up half way through.

6. You should stop playing American "football".  There is only one kind of 
football.  What you refer to as American "football" is not a very good game. 
The 2.15% of you who are aware that there is a world outside your borders may 
have noticed that no one else plays "American" football.  You will no longer 
be allowed to play it, and should

body armour like nancies).We are hoping to get together at least a US rugby 
sevens side by 2005.

document. Can we send it to you to help us get the necessary signatures for

1. Certificate of Assistant Secretary

2. Certificate of Secretary

3. Unanimous Consent of Directors (this is incomplete cos I am not sure of 
the part starting from RESOLVED ..)


Is there any other documents that I have missed out?  Would appreciate your

anything incorrect, please guide me accordingly.

Dune, I've reviewed the NDA and all of their changes are acceptable, except:

--  The additions to the two sentences in Section 1 don't make sense as
written, so should be restated as follows:
Any written Confidential Information will be clearly labeled "Confidential
Information" or, in the absence thereof, will be deemed Confidential
Information if it is of such nature as should be known to the receiving Party
to be confidential.  Any Confidential Information transmitted orally will be
clearly identified as such by the Party disclosing such information at the
time it is disclosed or, in the absence thereof, will be deemed Confidential
Information if it is of such nature as should be known to the receiving Party
to be confidential.

--  We can't agree to the new language in Section 10.

Feel free to forward my comments to Enron if you would like.  I would have
revised the CDA accordingly, but they use a different redlining system than we
do.

Thanks.

 - dune.thorne.vcfOn First Energy, we originally had them open for financial and shut down for

I thought this might be helpful.

Tana, 

The counterparties below are about to be approved in Credit. It would be 
great to get your Legal response before you leave for
vacation.  We can then minimize approvals that go through Mark Taylor next 
week.  

Thanks,
Camille

Attached are ClickPaper approvals for November 20, 2000.  Please note that 
the credit limits in the spreadsheet reflect one-tenth of the actual credit 
limit that we have assigned for a given counterparty since the headroom 
within ClickPaper is calculated using Sigma Factor * Volume rather than 
Pprice * Volume.  We will assign all future limits by using one-tenth of the 
assigned credit limit since using the Sigma factor in these calculations 
generates a value of roughly one-tenth of the full limit.  Hopefully this 
will eliminate some of the recent problems we've had with counterparties 
busting their credit limits.  Please call or send a note if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

Walter

I sent Scott Sefton and email and he responded that at this time he doesn't 
know the exact Brits that will be coming for the conference, he expects 6-8.  
I think we should order 8 mens shirts in large.  So I don't think you need to

Tax advise that this would create a permanent establishment for tax purposes, 
thus drawing EnronCredit.com Ltd into a US tax net.
NOT a good idea!
(It would be OK if Jeff lived in the UK!)
The solution is to set up a dedicated US entity, which we are working on.

Subject: EnronCredit.com Houston signatory

Gillian spoke to Jeff Kinneman and he would like to get whatever 
documentation would be required to permit him to execute documents here in 
Houston on a going forward basis for Credit.com.  We don't know what it will 
take to do this, but it really isn't practical for us to get Jim Derrick or 
Mark Frevert to sign.  







Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have recently upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

With respect to Deutsche Bank (""DB"), we have one credit issue remaining, DB 
would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as 
Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat 
hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured 
loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement.  Sara and Bill 
Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this 
remaining issue.

With respect to First Union National Bank, the draft we were working from was 
so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was 
sent to them on 11/8/00 for review.  Sara is working on that with Susan 
Bailey, another paralegal in our Group.

Can you please give Greg Johnston, Peter Keohane and Mark Powell, lawyers in 
our Calgary office, as well as their assistants Linda Sietzema and Sharon 
Crawford,  full edit access to the Financial Trading Agreements database.  
Can you please let me know when their access has been granted.

Thanks!Per your request, I am attaching the Executed Masters List.  Please feel free 
to call me anytime I can be of help!
Help me...I don't understand this LME Contract.  Mark says that even though 
we trade it on EOL and the trade is still done directly with us, it is still 
considered an LME contract, and not a lookalike.  I think I might need to 
talk to you about this tomorrow, because I'm confused.

Also, I am getting a lot of calls from the MG people in New York about 
pursuing metals counterparties, and I think we need to figure out whether 
they should be talking to Houston or London Legal...I'm not sure who their 
lawyers should be...also, the online team here in Houston is pursuing their 
business, and it's not clear to me if I should also be having them call you 
about potential metals customers?

Anyway, when I get in can I give you a call?

Also, I left a voicemail for your assistant, I'm trying to track down 
Edmund's address so I can send him a gift, but no response?  Do you know when 
he'll be back, or how I can get in touch with him?As usual, you're the best!

The attached legal name changes have been made in GCP.  The CXY Marketing 
entities and Canadian Occidental records were overlayed due to a name change 
to Deven.  See attachment for details.


.On a going forward basis, can we add the type of corporation or entity the 
counterparty is into the "Corporate History" drop down in Lotus Notes (like 
Delaware corporation, North Dakota non-profit electric cooperative 
corporation, Texas state agency, or whatever).  It helps me and some of the 
non-US lawyers with their approvals for EOL..

On Basin Electric Power Cooperative, Credit wants to open them up for power, 
but Leslie's records are showing they are not a FERC approved marketer.  If 
we want to open them for power, we're going to need the name and phone number 
of someone at the counterparty so we can talk to them about their FERC status.

For HS Energy Services, no change to my prior approval, which would have them 
open for all financial except Australian power.  (Also, shutting down 
Argentina gas...)


This link should be ok.

One of the tools that she will be needing is the Financial Trading Database.  
Before I forward this email to Georgi so that she can access the Financial 
Trading Database, I wanted to make sure that this link is the most current

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

Can you let me know if the following products are approved for trading for 
Singapore counterparties, and what restrictions, if any, they might have 
(like the eligible swap participant rules in the U.S.):

Commodity Derivatives (energy commodity, metals)
Weather Derivatives
Credit Derivatives

Further, would there be any limitation for a Singapore counterparty to trade 
any of the products we offer, physical or financial online?  I am going to 
attach to this one of our recent excel spreadsheets showing all the products 
we trade.

Are there any counterparties that are problematic for derivatives in 
Singapore?  For instance, here in the U.S., we flag governmental entities for 
no trading until we have a master in place, or upfront due diligence required 
before we can approve mutual funds or hedge funds, etc.

Tana, I will be on leave until 2 January 2001. Over that period I have made 
arrangements for the legal review of the daily EOL credit responses to be 
reviewed  outside counsel. Accordingly over that period would you forward the 
daily spreadsheets to my admin. assistant Alison Keogh. She will then 
coordinate the review. Whilst counsel have been briefed on the process and 
what is expected of them  it would be of assistance if you would continue 
your current practice of highlighting in your covering email any particular 
counterparties on which you would like a response from us.

   
Matt,

 As you may or may not know, I am the liason in Houston between the Online 
Team and Legal, coordinating all responses for counterparty approvals for all 
products.  I am asking because until recently I have not been approving 
Singapore counterparties to trade any financial products.  It has been my 
understanding that there are not problems for any counterparties trading 
physical products.  I can continue my practice of not opening Singapore 
incorporated counterparties to trade financial products online until I get a 
real push from a counterparty that wants to trade financial.  Should that be 
my continuing practice?

Hi Tana

Trust you are well.

OTC derivatives are not regulated in Singapore. The issue is whether a 
particular product type may infringe gaming or insurance regulations. This is 
particularly pertinent to Weather and Credit, for which I would need to 
consult external counsel for definite answers. Is there a new commercial push 
to do so at this time? We haven't any Weather and Credit traders here in 
Singapore.

As for metals, if they are exchange traded futures contracts (eg. London 
Metals Exchange contracts), the trading of gold would be regulated.

There is no category of counterparty that would be particularly problematic. 
Capacity issues would be determined by each company's constitutional 
documents.

Hope this helps.

Regards
Matt

403-974-6731It was good to hear from you!

We had a nice Thanksgiving here too.  It's funny, because usually it's just 
me, Mom, Craig and Danelia, and Danelia doesn't really like roasted turkey or 
roast beef (not that she would say it to me!), so there is not just the same 
joy in cooking it would be elsewise.

It was good having the girls down.  We played a new version of Uno called 
"African Uno" that was complex, fast and at times, physically challenging.  
It's not for the meek.  It was incredible what a good player Alena was.  She 
had her cards memorized as well as everyone elses (when you play you'll see 
why you can know everyone elses hands!).

I expect Craig didn't want Mom to see his place because it was messy.  I 
think compared to my house, he's embarrased about his apartment.  Then, also, 
he's got so much stuff in there right now, that I don't know how he's going 
to fit baby stuff.  They would only give him a 6 month lease when he renewed 
his lease last month because they don't want 3 people in that small 
apartment.  So he's going to have to start looking for another place.  And 
his apartment is so run down down I'm afraid roaches might be crawling over 
the baby.

I guess Mom is going to come back down sometime in March or April to see the 
new baby.  You'll have to come visit to check out my new house.  The upstairs 
"guest suite" is pretty neat.  It's got its own bathroom and tv, and is 
pretty cozy.

As far as the call with Uncle Ben goes, if he was thrilled to hear from me I 
couldn't tell by his voice.  It was a pretty stilted conversation for both of 
us.  But, I guess, it's a start...

I've already made my XMAS plans.  I leave the evening of the 21st, my flight 
comes in about 10 pm, and leave the morning of the 27th at 6 am.  

It's good chatting with you.  Keep in touch!

Attached is the referenced agreement.  Let me know if the notice information 
is OK with you.  If so, I'll get it signed by Craig Breslau today, then bring 
it to you for countersignature.  Thinking about that, what's your title?  I'm 
not sure you have the authority to sign documents w/o special authority...
No, it does not mean that.   Adding all the Enron "Specified Entities" would 
only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron 
entities a default under this agreement.   Our concern is that we don't want 
any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan 
transaction which has a swap as a component.

With respect to Deutsche Bank (""DB"), we have one credit issue remaining, DB 
would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as

I spoke to Mark Taylor about your signing authority, and he agrees that you 
do not have the authority to execute documents on your own, but as long as 
you are only co-signing documents signed by an authorized officer as a

will they always be standalone under the GTC?If possible, can we hold this meeting until Mark gets back.  I think Mark's

We have Confidentiality provisions in many of our swap agreements that 
prohibit us from providing copies of our master swap agreements to other 
parties, including, other Enron affiliates.  All requests by non-Enron North 
America employees for copies of swap master agreements should be forwarded to

With respect to the agreements listed below, I will take a look at those and

Bill Bradford in Credit had a conference call today with the Deutsche Bank 
Credit person and I think we have come to agreement on not adding any 
specified entities to the ISDA Master Agreement.  He also discussed  proposed 
credit limits for the three other Deutsche Bank masters we want to get in 
place (including EnronCredit.com).  I think we are done now and hope to get 
execution documents from them, since the documents are on their system.  Our

any changes necessitated by change of law, and otherwise turn around the 
remaining masters quickly.  I'll keep you posted.

Tana,

Thanks for keeping us updated on the Deutsche negotiations.  If, as you
suggest, Deutsche can prepare a Master for the EnronCredit.com Limited
Master as the docs are on their system then this would be useful, and I will
review and comment on those.  The one thing they will need to ensure as you
mentioned is that the Master Agreement is governed by English law.  In
addition, I  am not sure if you have put a CSA in place with Deutsche, but
if you have (presumably a Paragraph 13 under the NY law CSA?) we would need
the corresponding Paragraph 11 to the English Law CSA.

Many thanks again and we look forward to progressing this matter.

Kind regards,

Clare

Per email from Leslie Hansen, one of our power attorneys, counterparty cannot 
transact US physical power.  On the financial side, we just got an ISDA 
Master Agreement in place with this Counterparty, so they should be ok for 
all financial (except Credit Derivatives (bankruptcy swaps)).  We will only 
consider those on a case by case basis.  Per Sara Shackleton, an attorney in 
the Swap Group, there is nothing about this counterparty that would require 
any special reps and counterparty should not in any way be considered a 
"governmental".  No Argentina gas for any non-Argentina counterparties.  All 
other US products appear to be OK.

Click on the following  link to add the 'Financial Trading Agreements' 
database to your Notes Workspace:

Link -->We have received the following fully executed documents back from 
EnergyGateway:

1.  Provider Agreement dated 12/04/00.  This Agreement provides that the 
Monthly Membership Fee of $1,500 shall be waived for the first six months of 
the contract, starting November 30, 2000 thru May 31, 2001.

2.  Natural Gas Marketplace General Terms and Conditions dated 11/30/00.

A copy will be sent to Sheri Thomas and Craig Breslau.A woman named Janette Bertel at McLaren Energy just left a message for Genia 
who had just sent them a power master, that they also want to get an ISDA 
Master in place with us.  The woman's phone no is 819/986-4616.  If you could 
send up some credit for this, we'd appreciate it!  The wheels of DeutscheBank turn very slowly.  It appears their Credit guy 
didn't communicate our agreement regarding Specified Entities to his legal 
team, so Sara Shackleton said they are confirming that information before 
they send a revised draft.  Further, he said all changes have to be sent to 
Germany first for approval, so now we need to wait on Germany...!

Tana,

Thanks for keeping us updated on the Deutsche negotiations.  If, as you
suggest, Deutsche can prepare a Master for the EnronCredit.com Limited
Master as the docs are on their system then this would be useful, and I
will
review and comment on those.  The one thing they will need to ensure as you
mentioned is that the Master Agreement is governed by English law.  In
addition, I  am not sure if you have put a CSA in place with Deutsche, but
if you have (presumably a Paragraph 13 under the NY law CSA?) we would need
the corresponding Paragraph 11 to the English Law CSA.

Many thanks again and we look forward to progressing this matter.

Kind regards,

Clare

For those of you keeping track, Carrizo makes 475 master swap agreements.  
Conferring with Team Swap, we have at least 20 masters out or going out for 
sigature this week (including the 9 Merit Energy Partner masters).  Unlike 
the media in the Presidential Election, I hesitate to call this one an early 
win (especially after seeing the Board in Marie's office!), but I must say, 
Team Swap is looking strong.

For those of you keeping track, Carrizo makes 475 master swap agreements.  
Conferring with Team Swap, we have at least 20 masters out or going out for 
sigature this week (including the 9 Merit Energy Partner masters).  Unlike 
the media in the Presidential Election, I hesitate to call this one an early 
win (especially after seeing the Board in Marie's office!), but I must say, 
Team Swap is looking strong.

Justin & Matt,

Beth Cowan is a member here of the EnronOnline Marketing Team.  Her 
Counterparty, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, would like to get an ISDA 
Master Agreement in place with ECTRIC (per Beth, they don't like our form of 
GTC).  We already have a Local Currency form in place with ENA, but 
obviously, that would not be an appropriate form for London to use.  It is 
also on our form of Schedule from 1996, which we wouldn't want to work off of 
either.  In addition, I've checked the Confidentiality Provisions, and they 
do not have affiliate language in that would allow me to provide a copy of 
the agreement to you w/o counterparty's consent.  Saying all that, could you 
please help Beth out...

Tana-

Should I direct Anadarko's initial questions about the ISDA to you - they had 
been directed to Edmund Cooper, but we would like to get them online to 
transact and it sounds like they need the ISDA in place first.

Thanks,

Beth,

Don was correct in that I handle matters dealing with physical hydrocarbons.

However, Leslie Hansen of the Legal Department generally handles  GTC matters 
for EOL. Please consult with her on the Marathon matter.

Mark Taylor and his group in the Legal Department handle financial trading 
and ISDA matters.

I hope this is helpful.

Please advise if you have any other questions.

Harry- 
I have recently begun working on marketing EnronOnline to the crude 
customers.  Don Schroeder told me you were the attorney who works with that 
desk.  I have some questions that have arisen that I was hoping you could 
answer. 

Don said Marathon Ashland Petroleum had some legal issues that were 
preventing them from trading online and I was hoping you could tell me where 
they stand or if you have had any conversations with them.  

Also, I spoke with Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and they want to do some 
crude financial deals but do not have an ISDA in place with Enron Capital & 
Trade International which is who he said he understood the contract needed to 
be in place with because he has some problems with the GTC's - does he speak 
with Edmund Cooper about those problems or should he address his concerns to 
you?

Thank You for your help,
Beth Cowan

the internal masters are kept in Houston.  I will send you a copy.
2.  Moravske Naftove is an agreement that London Legal got in place.  We do 
not have copies here, I suggest you contact Matt Dawson to get a copy.
3.  Risk Mangement & Trading/ECTRIC-I will send you a copy.
4.  State Street Bank, as Trustee/ECTRIC-this was for the Cash VI Project and 
is not for general trading purposes.  I will send copies to you.
5.  Elf Trading S.A./ECTRIC-London Legal should have copies.  Contact Matt

Sorry for the delay.

Here are the next four descriptions.



Only the three liquids one waiting now.

I have sent these to David Forster in our Project group to review first 
before I send them to yourself.  If I don't get them back today I will send 
them over the weekend so they are there for you on Monday.

Could you please send me comments back on all the other descriptions today.  
Is your fax machine at your end OK?  It's just that the other fax you sent 
came through a dark background making the comments a little hard to read.

My fax is 44 171 316 5420.

I have forwarded the descriptions you have sent us thus far to the respective 
Legal Trading Lawyers to sign off as far any legal issues we may have with 
the descriptions.  I understand your deadline is the end of the week.

When can I expect the remaining descriptions?

This report does not have volume or prices.  If you need this info, let me 
know.
I would like to amend my earlier approval with respect to the ISDA Master 
Agreement we recently executed with this Counterparty to limit their 
financial trading to energy commodity trading only.  This counterparty is NOT 
approved to trade any other products including , but not limited to, weather, 
pulp & paper, plastics, steel, metals, interest rate & currency, fx, or 
credit derivatives.I'm just sitting here worrying about one of my side deals with Frank, so just 
to reiterate a global shut down (like-no one does Credit Derivatives unless 
we really mean it), no non-European based counterparty (in all probability, 
no counterparty originating from U.S. Credit) should be approved to trade 
European physical power products.  They have licensing requirements similar 
to our FERC licensing.

Thanks!So far, I can probably leave on time today, which would be about 5:30 pm.  
Let's just check again as the end of the day gets closer.  I think it would 
be a good idea to meet there, since we're coming from opposite directions.  
Dinner sounds good to me....

be a good time for you to go.  We can meet there and then go to dinner.  Or,
you could come by my place and get a look again and help me pick out the

Oops, already had to make change!
Can she get it wrong twice within 1 minute?  The answer is YES!
For the two amended counterparties listed, I have amended-no change, because 
neither was approved for physical power or financial trading, and I do not 
want that to change.  I don't care about Credit opening them up or shutting 
them down for physical gas.
Are you there.  I tried calling and no one picked up.  I'm ready to go...

ENA does not have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy Trading Power 
L.P.  Enron Canada does have an ISDA Master in place with PG&E Energy 
Trading, Canada Corporation.  Could the trades be done under that master?

Also, below is an agent that should connect you to the Financial Trading 
Agreement database, where you can look up what master agreements we have in 
place.

Can you let me know if ENA has an ISDA signed with PG&E Energy Trading Power 
L.P.  I am looking at doing a financial swap against the Ontario IMO spot 
price with PG&E and was wondering if it could be done under and existing ISDA

Southern transaction).

Please contact Chris or myself with any questions.

West Power (11 Pages) and US Natural Gas (5 pages).  There is a quite urgent 
deadline to get these uploaded into the web pages and then integrated into

Steven & Carol,

I am working for Louise Kitchen on the EnronOnline project.  As part of the 
site we are incorporating market descriptions of all the main market that we 
will be trading on the system to give users some general information.

I have collected and rewritten these into a standard format and am currently 
in the process of obtaining Legal and regulatory approval of these 
descriptions that will be visible to anyone on the web.

In Total there are 12 descriptions covering North Amercia.  These are listed 
below.

Canada Gas
LPG
NOx Emissions
Oil & Oil products
Plastics and Petrochemicals
Pulp & Paper
SO2 Emissions
US Coal
US Natural Gas
US East Power
US West Power
Weather Derivatives

I have below the completed descriptions to date.  Please could you pass to 
the respective people in your groups for their review and comments.  I would 
appreciate it if you could provide your comments as soonas possible as these 
have to be approved and loaded into the web site this week.  

Below are 5 of the descriptions.  I shall send the remainder to yourselves 
tomorrow.



If you have any questions my telephone number in London is  44 171 970 7377.

Thanks

Awais

3.  Add door knocker to middle of front  door (cute kitty door knocker!).
4.  Replace light in front sunroom with new light.

__________________________________________________________

The expiration date for the January 2001 options contract for Gasoline-Crack

representative present at their normal work station promptly at 5:30 p.m. 
until released by the Exchange staff as specified below.  All adjustments 
and/or corrections, must be accompanied by relevant supporting documentation 
prior to being incorporated into expiration processing, in essence making the 
expiration processing an extension of the afternoon trade resolution 
procedures.  All input to the NYMEX Clearing Department will conclude no 
later than 30 minutes after floor representatives are released.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110), Floor Trade Correction (299-2068 and 299-2169)

Laurel Adams provided me your name to help us with the information regarding 
the legal contracts we are needing.  I am forwarding you the request that was 
originally sent to Laurel.  At this time, we would like to review the 
contracts that are listed below as part of our deal test.  As we need to 
complete our testing by Friday the 15th, we would like to review these 
contracts sometime today or tomorrow.  I apologize for the short notice; 
however, we received your name as the contact person yesterday.   Please let 
me know if can help us with this request.  If you have any questions or need 
additional information, please contact me at 3-1951.

Thank you,

We have been unsuccessful in getting the contract numbers in order to pull 
the contracts for the deals in our deal test.  We have talked with Bridgette 
Anderson and Anthony Campos in Global Contracts to obtain these numbers; 
however, we have had some difficulty.  What we are needing is the ISDA Master

Your email captured the concern of our lawyers concerning business review of 
these descriptions.  They are being forwarded to our business people now for 
review, but I don't expect that we will have them ready until Tuesday (Monday 
being a federal holiday here).  I don't know what problems this is going to 
cause, but our lawyers feel it is very important that we get this business 
input on these descriptions.   Jeff Hodge left a voicemail with David Forster 
to this effect.Taffy, can you please copy these masters for Carrie ASAP.  Thanks.

I couldn't check to see if they have revised this, so by copy of this to Matt

Derek,

I think we just need to revise the header on the Chilean Annex to say "Annex 
A-Chile".  When it was renamed, it wasn't renamed in the front of the 
confirmation, so we just need to fix that glitch.

Please find attached our proposed Second Amendment, which would replace the

have in place with an ISDA Credit Support Annex and Paragraph 13 thereto.  If 
you have any questions or comments concerning the form please call me at 
(713) 853-3399 or Sara Shackleton, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-5620.  Tanya

With respect to Commercial Risk Re-Insurance Company, a Bermuda company, 
although they are being sent thru to specifically open them for weather, 
Brent Hendry says I can't open them up until we review their Memorandum of 
Association (like their articles of incorporation) to confirm that nothing in 
them would prohibit this type of transaction.  Can you contact whomever sent 
you the Password Application and ask them to fax their Memorandum of 
Association to us.  Thanks!

Steve, I don't know if we are duplicating your effort, but our ECT lawyers 
here were also concerned about business review of these product descriptions, 
so they have forwarded these descriptions on to their respective business 
groups for approval.  If we are duplicating your work, or doing something 
contrary to what we should be doing, please call me or Jeff and we will try 
to coordinate our responses.  Otherwise, we will continue the review we are 
doing.

Steven I have a special favour to ask.  All the descriptions were written by

The following descriptions need some attention which I would appreciate if 
someone from your dept could give. 

LPG  This is missing a complete section.  Is it possible to insert a couple 
of paragraphs here.
US Nat Gas A have written this anfroma alot of material I got fromt he 
group.  However I still feel the reg section is more of a historical 
recounter than a statement of the current environment.  The last paragraph 
mentions about the reg bodies for LDC's.  Is it possible to add a little bit 
more on the current reg bodies and regulations themselves.

The Paul's

In short it is suggested we have a disclaimer at the front of each 
description as well as a link ot the Legal & Provacy statement.

I do not like the idea of a disclaimer on the front of each description so 
what about putting one at the bottom of the market info page where the names 
of the markets are displayed?

Justin, would this be acceptable.  The Market Info page is a page which lists 
the names of the markets and the user selects the appropriate description 
from there.  Can you suggest an appropriate discliamer to put in?

Justin,

I have now reviewed the market descriptions. As instructed, I have not
sought advice from Nick O'Neill or Charlotte Stalin on the regulatory issues
which may arise from this. I understand that you will be considering these.

I confirm that there does not appear to be anything obnoxious in these
descriptions. However, I should say that I am not an expert on the subject
matter of the descriptions and therefore, I would only be able to spot very
obvious problems. Clearly, you need to be comfortable that the contents of
them are true and not defamatory. For example, where you have stated that an
entity is a monopoly you must be sure that this is the case.

Ideally, you should have a statement on the screen that this is provided for
information purposes only and should not be relied on. If this is
unacceptable (and ideally in addition to that statement), there should be a
link to the legal and privacy statement.

Kind regards.

Andrew

Tana,

the descriptions were written by the commercial groups themselves on the 
whole.  So There should not be any consern fromt he business.  What I was 
going to do is give the final descriptions after Legal and Regulatory 
amendments to them again for final OK.

Your email captured the concern of our lawyers concerning business review of 
these descriptions.  They are being forwarded to our business people now for 
review, but I don't expect that we will have them ready until Tuesday (Monday 
being a federal holiday here).  I don't know what problems this is going to 
cause, but our lawyers feel it is very important that we get this business 
input on these descriptions.   Jeff Hodge left a voicemail with David Forster 
to this effect.

not had a chance to see an overview or have people in your group that could

project continues to be confidential in nature so please limit participation

I will be attending the online presentation today at 4.Just wanted to let you know I faxed the OMnet Agreement over to Susan Gill 
today about 3:30 pm our time.  I have the originals and asked her to tell me 
what address she wants me to send the originals to.  I didn't date the front 
page of the agreement because I didn't know what date you wanted them to be 
effective so I'll leave that to y'all to work out.  I'm working on getting 
the other documents signed and I guess I can get them all out in the same 
package, maybe tomorrow.   I'll visit with you tomorrow about what to do.Here's coal.  That just leaves power and any revisions to pulp & paper we may 
get from the business people.

I spoke to Steve Kean's assistant, and told her your deadline to get all 
these descriptions done was the end of today.  She said she would pass the 
word on and try and get you comments by the end of the day.  Let me know if 
that doesn't happen.Either day is fine for me.De nada!I guess I still need your market descriptions for LPG, Oil & Oil Products and 
Plastics and Petrochem.  Will I have them by the end of the day?Thanks Shari!We are in the process of filing our annual hedge exemptions with the NYMEX 
for 1999.  In connection therewith, I will need to provide the NYMEX with an 
updated copy of the alphabetical list of Enron Corp. and Subsidiary 
Companies.  My last list was dated June 8, 1998.

Thanks Kate, as usual, for your help!I am getting ready to fax you Steve Kean's comments to the language.  Steve 
Kean is marking this material as to regulatory information only.  Not as to 
legal.  He told me he also passed these market descriptions to Karen Denney 
in Public Relations for her comments and she supposedly is going to send her 
comments to me for forwarding to you.  I will let you know as soon as I 
receive your comments.Were you serious about our conversation Friday, or were you kidding me?  If 
you were serious I'd like to talk to you about it.After our meeting last week I spoke to Mary about getting a list of the 
products trading restrictions in our financial master and I haven't received 
it.  With Mary out I don't know who to contact to get it, can you help me 
with this?  Also, would it be possible to get a list of the global contract 
numbers for our financial masters?  Thanks!Below is the memo from ISDA that needs to be read in conjunction with that

Tana, Steven,  here are the last three descriptions



Steven I have a special favour to ask.  All the descriptions were written by 
the commercial groups and they are a bit scanty on regulatory in places.
The following descriptions need some attention which I would appreciate if 
someone from your dept could give. 

LPG  This is missing a complete section.  Is it possible to insert a couple 
of paragraphs here.
US Nat Gas A have written this anfroma alot of material I got fromt he 
group.  However I still feel the reg section is more of a historical 
recounter than a statement of the current environment.  The last paragraph 
mentions about the reg bodies for LDC's.  Is it possible to add a little bit 
more on the current reg bodies and regulations themselves.

Thanks

I have sent these to David Forster in our Project group to review first

Could you please send me comments back on all the other descriptions today.  
Is your fax machine at your end OK?  It's just that the other fax you sent

Attached is the latest version of the counterparty/product type matrix.  The 
matrix consist of four colour coded counterparty sections.

Section 1 (white) is the fully approved list from credit with limits noted. 
Section 2 (green) is a second approved list from credit which does not have 
limits noted, yet (credit work in progress). 
Section 3 (blue) consist of counterparties included in the external marketing 
company mailshot, but have not been reviewed by credit, legal, or tax. 
Section 4 (orange) includes counterparties received from the originators & 
marketers that will be manually mailed on Sept 13, but have not yet been 
reviewed by credit, legal, or tax.

The product types at the top (row 10) of the matrix have been updated also to 
the "final" upload version.  Some product types have been deleted and some 
have been added.  The product types that have been added are highlighted in 
yellow.

All of the counterparties on this matrix will be mailed a brochure on 
September 13.  (High credit risk counterparties from section 4 will be pulled 
if we receive notice immediately)  This should be the final pre-launch 
counterparty matrix and will serve as the goal for pre approved 
authorisation.  The counterparty system upload will occur within the next few 
days.  Any approvals/adjustments  received after this upload will require 
manual entries through the GUI by product control.

We understand that this has been a long process with many changes.  This 
matrix has been refined since the initial distribution to Tax, Credit and 
Legal on July 30, 1999.  I apologize for the tough task.

The goal now is to obtain sign off on this pre launch matrix ASAP: 

Credit should provide the limits for Section 2, review Sections 3 & 4 to 
ensure adherence to the Enron Credit Policy  and work closely with Legal and 
Global on providing a Master Agreement matrix

Tax should review the additions to the matrix to ensure that the profile does 
not breach any tax laws or create a tax exposure and work with Global resolve 
the issue of country of incorporation

Legal should fill in the matrix to ensure that there are no legal or 
regulatory impediments to trade and work closely with Legal and Global on 
providing a Master agreement matrix

I will be co-ordinating with Jeff Hodge (US Legal); Justin Boyd (UK Legal); 
Debbie Brackett (Global Credit); Janine Juggins (UK Tax); Connie Sutton 
(Global)  and Stephen Douglas (US Tax) tomorrow to see what it will take to 
finish this task off.  Please call me with any questions at X30397. 

Thank you for the work you have done to date and for all that is yet to be 
completed.

Bob

Dave,
Awais's records show that you (or Marcello)  haven't reviewed the following 
ones yet:
LPG
Oil and Oil Products
Plastic and Petchems
Nordic Power

Thank you all,
Elena

All the descriptions except weather have already been emailed to Awais and I 
have asked him to provide them to you.  I understand you have weather which 
was faxed.  Mike,

You may recall that I have asked that Brent Hendry, an attorney in our Buenos 
Aires office, be given access to our Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement 
Database and that appears not to have happened yet.  Can you please let me 
and Brent know what needs to be done to grant hims access.  

Brent will also need additional attorneys added to the database.  Brent, can 
you provide Mike with a list of any other individuals 
(Legal/Credit/Secretarial only) you would like granted access.

Mike, it also appears Brent would like to copy our database to set up a 
document tracking database in B.A.  Who should he contact here to get a new 
database created similar to ours?

Thanks for your help!
Brent,

I have asked several times to get you access to Lotus Notes.  If we don't get 
you access in response to this latest email, we may need to kick it higher.

Hope you are doing well...we miss you!I just thought of one other thing we need to discuss with Credit in our 
meeting.  I've asked them to get back to me about this several times and 
haven't heard.

In the collateral annexes, we have interest on collateral computed at 360 
days.  So we don't have problems with Canadian counterparties, I would like 
to change that to 365/366 accross the board.  I asked them if there was any 
specific reason why we've got interest on collateral at 360, like maybe it's 
the custom in the bank/dealer markets.  Anyway, I'd like to get that 
answered.One personal day this monday.Following up on our conversation re: a visit to Santa Fe when you come to 
Houston, check out the Website for The Bishop's Lodge in Santa Fe 
(www.bishopslodge.com).   Some friends of mine bought a weekend there at a 
silent auction at a charity event recently and their brochure looked great.  
The website has pictures, prices, activities at the resort, and a hyperlink 
to the Website for the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce which lists the 
activities going on in Santa Fe.  I think you are going to be too late for 
their summer opera series, but I took a look and there appears to be other 
fun things going on.  The website for the lodge shows a fabulous looking 
pool, horseback riding and shooting.  Take a look.I don't know if your directory is supposed to be the place where all the most 
current GTC's are kept, but there have been some changes while you've been 
gone.  I think Stacy has created  new firm GTC's, and Leslie Hansen has 
revised the power to change the tax language and also change some of the 
reps.  I told her to coordinate any changes she might have with David 
Forster.  Janice has also been revising her forms to deal with some EFP 
issues.We have added the new One Way, Cash and Letter of Credit Collateral Annex to 
the back of the Industrial Master.  It is still located in my form directory, 
called industrial-u.s.#5.doc.I'll put together some sample stuff and send it to you today.  We really do 
have a problem getting responses from our computer people, so I hope a 
relentless bird-dog effort may bring a response.It's not clear to me that our draft of the referenced agreement is the 
latest.  Mark thought London may have made some additional changes.  Can you 
email me the latest draft.  Thanks!Blue Range Resources Corporation is an executed ISDA Master we have for ECT 
Canada that went into bankruptcy.  It shows up on my list because I'm working 
off the original list, but it is not a good Credit counterparty so it doesn't 
show up on Credit's approved counterparty list.  I just want to make sure 
that we don't send them any mailouts.Just checking to get a status report on your offsite.  I hope there was no 
frivolity or frolickling had by anyone...!I've found a great website to check on utilities (trying to figure out if a 
counterparty is one, or whether its a governmental one).  It's at 
www.utilityconnection.com.  It even has non-U.S. utilities.  When you have a 
minute, give it a look.Taffy, can you check Grant's list against our list of executed masters for 
ECT Canada.  The Canada office is missing some of the masters we have in 
place, and we have to provide them copies.  See me and I'll show you how to 
do a sort on Lotus Notes to figure out what executed masters we show Canada 
has in place, vs. the masters they think they have in place.  Thanks!

Hi Tana, as per our conversation this morning here is list of counterparites 
that we think we have ISDAs with.

Please review and update at your convenience.  If there are any changes could 
you please edit the file and return it to me? 

 If there are counterparties that we indicate as having no ISDA, could you 
forward the appropriate documentation to Nella so that we have our files 
current.


Thank you very much.

Attached please find my proposed revisions to the East and West Power Online 
Market Descriptions.  I have revised the first section (Background) of each 
document from an editorial perspective.  The remaining changes are intended 
to correct inaccuracies in the documents.  I've spoken with Allan Aronowitz 
about the fact that it might be a good idea to include some general 
disclaimers relating to any projections or the like included in these 
descriptions and think that it would be an excellent idea to include such a 
disclaimer.  I have accordingly left in some forward-looking type projections 
that I might otherwise recommend revising or deleting altogether.  If you do 
not intend to include any general disclaimers, let me know so that I can 
further revise as necessary.

Please feel free to call me at (713) 853-6121 with any questions or comments 
relating to the attached.

Regards, 

Leslie Hansen

 


Brent,

I'm sure there would be no problem with you copying our Master Swap Agreement 
database and using it for your contract applications.  It is my hope to use 
it for all the ECT trading groups, the Power group has already copies it, I 
spoke to London about copying it for their other trading groups, and I have 
shown it to other groups, from Global Contracts to EES.  All you would need 
to do is change the contract drop downs.  Contact Mike Neves, who is working 
on this database for us, and either he, or someone else can be assigned to 
developing a similar system for you.Sent again.

It turns out that Jeff Hodge made plane reservations for 1:30 pm on 
Wednesday.  Can we move that meeting up to 11:00 am?We have dinner reservations for Saturday at 7:30.  Reservation #189.I will be able to attend.Access to the online trading system?  If that's the questions, probably none 
of us.There will be a demonstration of the Online Trading Application for trading 
lawyers and paralegals on Wednesday at 11:00 am in EB2601a.

This project continues to be highly confidential.For online trading I am also going to have to sign off on whether we can 
trade with the UK based counterparty list, and I am probably going to need 
your help and your list to be able to do that.  I am totally unfamiliar with 
the UK based counterparties and in most cases their names aren't even in 
English so I can't even guess whether it would be an appropriate counterparty 
or not.  I am, obviously, most concerned about not approving trading with 
utilities and governmentals.  I've been searching that utility website trying 
to figure out which are utilities from that, and guessing at the names if it 
sounds like a utility or governmental.

Is your list done, or when will it be done?  Do you spell out if the 
counterparty is governmental/utility?  What help can you give me?I am faxing you both the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement executed between 
Enron Gas Marketing (merged now into ECT) and Aquila Energy Marketing 
Corporation (merged now into Utilicorp.) with respect to Utilicorp. "signing" 
the agreement in lieu of giving a guaranty.   Actually what Utilicorp. did in 
this agreement is sign as a co-obligor under the agreement (see Section 16.12 
of the agreement).  They signed accepting joint and several liability with 
respect to the obligations.   If we can get them to agree to the same 
language in your master agreement that would effectively be as good or better 
than getting a guaranty.   Anything less (like just sticking their "name" on 
the signature line) may not get us much or be worthless.

All this, of course, is subject to any differences between US and UK law or 
issues under UK law which I will leave in Edmund's capable hands.

Let me know if I can be of further service...Per the notes below, Jeff Hodge signed off on the description Awais sent us 
with no changes.  NOX and SOX are attached also.

Attached is a new version of the counterparty and product type matrix.  The

counterparties that were included in credits original approved list with 
limits noted.  The second section contains counterparties that were included 
in credits second approved list without any limits noted.  The third and last 
section contains counterparties that will be included in the initial 
mailshot, but have not yet been reviewed by credit.  Please note that there 
are also new product types in row 7 that were not on any of the matrices you 
have previously reviewed.  These new product types are highlighted in yellow 
and inserted next to similar product types.

Please call me with any questions/comments.

Just a note to make sure that I get any updates to the approved Counterparty 
list.  I will forward the list to the trading lawyers preparing their group's 
approved counterparty list here in Houston.Our review of the counterparty list is not considering, for the most part, 
state of incorporation.  The biggest consideration with derivatives is the 
country of incorporation (and additionally, the country(ies) in which trading 
will take place).  For the bulk of our swap counterparties, i.e. energy 
companies, state law currently isn't an in issue on approval of swap 
trading.  It is more of an issues with governmentals, utilities, insurance 
companies, pension funds and the like, and we do not capture that information 
until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty.  With utilities, you 
cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies 
to one utility will apply to another.  Each utility need to be looked at 
individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty.

The bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in 
active negotiation with, so we are not capturing state of incorporation.  I 
know the Global Contracts Group has been trying to capture that information.  
You may want to talk to Mary Gosnell.I am going to meet with Tom at 3:30 (after our ice cream social at 3:00) to 
go over my latest list of questions to the 2nd credit list, so how's about 
discussing any other financial issues we might have then...I gave Shari my whole file on Canadian cash collateral issues to look at.  
You may want to get it from her.  It has Fred Erickson's phone # in there 
also.Per Bill's email, I faxed a proposed form of Enron Corp. Guaranty to the 
counterparty.  Please do not approve any trades with this counterparty until 
due diligence is done on Italian law, which appears the be the place of 
incorporation of the counterparty.  I will not assign the review of Italian 
law to an attorney until we receive your credit worksheet.  If you feel we 
need to proceed with this now let me know and I will get someone to start 
looking at it.Unfortunately, providing Matt with the ISDA Master is a problem.  It's got 
the old confidentiality language in it that doesn't allow provision of the 
agreement to affiliates, so we cannot not send this agreement without 
Citibank's consent.  Matt, if you want it you'll have to get Citibank to tell 
us, Enron North America, that it's ok to provide the agreement to you (ECT 
International).  Sorry...I'm a little confused.  Do I need to contact Gary Bode to (1) get Brent and 
the Buenos Aires legal team access to the current Lotus Master Swaps 
Database, or (2) get the software developed for Brent to copy the database to 
create a document tracking database for the Argentina legal contracts, or (3) 
both?I have added Shari's MAC clause (when there is no collateral annex and MAC is 
an additional event of default) as an alternative in the MAC clauses for the 
ISDA Master Agreement contained in ISDAexh.doc.Yes, I put together a package of stuff and sent it to you.  I don't know how 
long mail takes to get there.  It will probably be there I hope in today's 
mail.I have been trying to get Brent Hendry and Andrea Calo (attorneys in our 
Buenos Aires office) access to the Houston Legal Department's Lotus Notes 
Master Swap Agreement database.  I understand that you are the person that 
can get them access.  This will continue to be an issue as we expand our 
trading offices around the world.  Can you let me, Mark Taylor, the Assistant 
General Counsel for trading, and Brent know what we need to do to get Brent 
and Andrea access.

Also, Brent wants to copy our Master Swap Agreement Database to create a 
database for the Buenos Aires legal contracts.  How does Brent go about 
getting this new database created?

Subject: MAC as an Additional Event of Default

John: Thanks for taking the time to read the email. I have not had many=20
responses!

There are two reasons why I drafted the clause in this way.=20

1) It tracks the "cure" modification clause for Credit Event Upon Merger (a=
nd=20
I think the cures for both clauses need to be consistent).

2) The wording is useful because it describes what the written demand is=20
asking for - i.e. "performance assurance".=20

Maybe there is a more elegant way of expressing #2 - maybe we just use "for=
"=20
rather than "therefor". I was not the original drafter of the CEUM provisio=
n=20
so I don't know why it was written this way but in any event, the concept o=
f=20
#2 needs to remain in clause in some fashion.=20

I will be out of the office from 9/22 to 10/3. Mark Taylor will be handling=

matters in my absence so I will forward this onto him to decide.

Hey John,

Thanks for the favour.  If you could put this in front of the right
person, I would be very gratetful. Do you guys have an office here in
New York or is all the legal work done out of Houston as well.

Hope the markets are treating you well.

Have you sent these to Steve Kean?The Legal/Credit meeting scheduled for tomorrow has been postponed 1/2 hour 
until 2:30 pm.If you find a product that does, keep me in the loop.  We're always looking 
for better ways to do things up here and unless Lexis/Nexis improves, I am 
currently not impressed with their product, compared to the old Information 
America, which was great before they bought it out and ruined it!  How are 
you doing?...you must be a little stressed with this Online project, as well 
as others...!We do not have a copy of the executed agreement for our files.  Can you have 
one of your assistant's copy it for me as well as any relevant guarantees, 
credit support documents, etc.

Much thanks...Well, it turns out that Mark Elliott needs a revised draft of the UK ISDA 
incorporating our form changes since he needs to send it to Gibraltar counsel 
for the legal review he's working on for Gibraltar law.  So, I'll work with 
Mark to come up with the form and then pass it on to you and the London legal 
team for approval.---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 09/22/99 10:01 AM

Shari,

The correct S&P rating is BBB- and as Pat mentioned, we DO want to include as 
part of the definition of Material Adverse Change if the counterparty ceases 
to be rated.  Let me know if you have questions.

I am sure that you noticed in the attachment that Shari has the trigger at 
BBB and not BBB-.  In addition, do we want to add language in that section 
that says an Event of Default also occurs if they are no longer rated by S&P?

Thanks for the material.  I've been really busy at work.  At some point when 
I have more of a break I'll call you.Mark Elliott just introduced me to another charming aspect of English

Please let me know by the end of business May 31, 1999 if you have any power 
of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any commodity futures 
account (other than an ECT account).

I'm working with Mark on approval of our counterparty lists for online 
trading.  Mark asked me to contact you about the approach we should take with 
respect to financial trading with Singapore counterparties.  Should Singapore 
be approved for all types of trading with all types of counterparties?  Are 
there are special counterparties we shouldn't approve for trading outside the 
governmentals, such as the utilites?  Are there any products that might not 
be approved for trading out of Singapore, such as weather, or any others?  
Are there any special types of reps we might need to include in our 
agreements?  Any guidance you could give us with this would be most 
appreciated!

being the troublemaker.  My review hasn't gone in yet and I guess I am going 
to have to mention...that you are the troublemaker!Wonderful job!Per Mark's conversation, you were going to get back to us on the scoop on 
France and utility counterparties.  Any update?What do you want to do with masters where we have a note that we got the 
master in, but we have a bad certificate, and no trading should be done until 
we get a new certificate?How was your trip back?  I hear from Taffy you cut quite the figure in your 
cowboy duds, right down to having the right style of Wrangler jeans.  The 
grapevine says you also did some mighty fine two steppin.  The bright lights

Tana,

ECT Houston can engage in commodity/weather derivatives trades direct with 
French counterparties, without having to use EEFT as the UK regulated 
arranger.  Put another way, whatever ECTRI can do from a regulatory 
perspective, the same applies to ECT Houston.  Please refer to the completed 
list that Edmund sent.

As for engaging in derivatives trades with utilities, this does not give rise 
to the issues as under US laws.  [In respect of new counterparties, standard 
due diligence as to corporate authority, etc will need to be done].

Hope all's well!

France and utility counterparties.  Any update?



That may not be so easy an answer.  I think we would have to talk to 
Utilicorp.'s lawyers.  I  wouldn't be surprised that they had some policy or 
laws that won't allow them to guaranty the obligations of other companies.  
Utilities in the U.S. are odd birds, there are a lot of Chinese walls in 
effect with them, I've dealt with similar issues on other utilities.  If you 
need us to talk to them get me the name and phone number of a contact and 
we'll give them a call.The meeting is to discuss confidentiality agreements.The mad cow disease must have extended to England's venerable sheep, thus 
causing a lack of worsted wool, hence, no new trousers which, I'm sure, is 
the only reason we haven't gotten a fashion bulletin from you in quite some 
time.

The men's fashion news here in the United States says that the current 
fashion in ladies pedal pushers (or knee length trousers) has now extended to 
the gents and is becoming quite the rage.  Fashion trends are quite slow in 
reaching the outbacks here in Texas, but I can see fashionable young swains 
in London and New York showing off their knees and ankles.  Has this trend 
crossed the Atlantic?!  Has Justin bought a pair in red?

We miss our Tim from Texas....stay in touch!

I spoke to Mary Solmonson about the chain of command in IT.  Obviously, 
everyone reports to Phillipe Bibi in the end.  She looked up Gary Bode, who 
Michael Neves, our Lotus Notes contact, reports to, and Gary is a Manager,

or Chris Behney.  (She said we could have her, but she would be very

Hey John,

Thanks for the favour.  If you could put this in front of the right
person, I would be very gratetful. Do you guys have an office here in
New York or is all the legal work done out of Houston as well.

Hope the markets are treating you well.

When you get back, I got a call from Koch about the Morgan "assignment".  As 
you recall, we are acting as agent on behalf of Morgan in connection with 
their commodity business.  Koch called me and they want to get a copy of the 
"assignment".  Since it wasn't an assignment, what should I provide them?  I 
don't know that I can provide them a copy of our Servicing Agreement.  What 
should I do?Per David Forster, they should be doing the online trading simulation 
tomorrow.Per Mark's approval, when we entered into the master with CGAS, we found out 
they never entered into a resolution approving the swap agreement or trades 
thereunder.  So each and everytime we do a trade with them we are going to 
have to get a resolution authorizing entering into the trade.

So for the executed master swap agreement list we need to put:  "Need board 
resolution prior to trading"To the trading lawyers working on counterparty lists:

Per the email below from Louise, the current target date for completion of 
counterparty lists appears to be Tuesday, October 12.  As noted below, an 
additional list of approved counterparties should be provided to us tomorrow.

FYI, per my conversations w/Frank Davis, the first simulation occurred this 
week, and an additional simulation is scheduled for next week.

I just got an update from the OMLX of their rules.  Do you need me to make 
you a copy or are you also getting updates?  Also, I get faxes of all their 
notices.  So far nothing I've received has been interesting.  Do you get 
copies of their notices?  Do you need me to send you anything I feel is worth 
noting?

They've also promoted me to Compliance Director, so I'm going to go in and 
ask Mark for a raise to match my title!I thought of you this weekend.  It was the fall antique festival in Round Top 
and I went, but it wasn't quite as nice as the pleasant day I had with you

Subject: Online Derivatives Trading with Regulated Utilities  

We have not decided "to prevent any regulated utility from completing any 
financial transactions" online.  If we have already satisfactorily concluded 
the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will 
be approved.  It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet 
been researched that we are withholding approval.  The due diligence required 
involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their 
organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant 
state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there 
and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular 
utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the 
utility's counsel.  We usually begin that process only when a trader believes 
there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to 
justify the time and expense.  FYI, the due diligence process has in the past 
revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives 
or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.

A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to 
40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process.

Per Mark's earlier emails and conversations, we have 10 govt's/utilities with 
masters in place that are approved to trade, with about another 30 currently 
being negotiated.  The other 30 or so will only be approved to trade when we 
get signed masters in place and any other relevant documents related thereto 
(like legal opinions).  That's ok.  Our trading policy doesn't allow you to trade anything we trade.We are getting calls from our brokers and the NYMEX telling us the brokers 
still have not received notification of our name change.  This is causing 
problems with the brokers clearing the trades on the NYMEX.  Per my voicemail 
several weeks ago, since you/your desk are our communications guy with the 
brokers,  they need to receive the notice as soon as possible.   When will 
you be able to get this notice our of our name change?I have already notified all the exchanges we deal with of the name change, 
but the NYMEX says the brokers have to file some form with the CFTC, and they 
can't file that form until they receive the notice from us.How can you be on vacation this week if you are responding to this email?---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 10/12/99 05:45 PM

To All

As we near completion of the master review for required collateral provisions 
for counterparts to trade OnLine, please find attached a consolidated list of 
exceptions.  This list highlights those counterparts where EOL should utilize 
GTCs with collateral in lieu of executed masters.  Summary findings are as 
follows:

1) Gas - reject master and use GTC w/collateral for 20 clients

2) Power - Reject 2 counterparts from trading OnLine

3) Financial - No exceptions

4) Canada - TBD

5) London - No exceptions

Thanks to everyone who assisted with this important review of credit 
provisions.   Please feel free to forward this note as necessary or contact 
me for any questions.

As far as your email questions, my responses are following:

1.  The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial 
counterparties.  There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow.
2.  Duke Energy Corporation.  At Mark's direction, I am sending his note 
below regarding utilities.  Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility 
counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal 
regulation or approvals they may be subject to.   We currently have masters 
in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.  We are in the process of 
negotiating another 30.  Until those masters are executed and we have the 
relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot 
approve them for online trading.  I have made every effort to search company 
websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility 
or not.  If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due 
diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or 
federal regulation.   Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only 
make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me.
3.  Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a 
regulated utility.  I am unable to determine from Credit or their website 
what type of regulation they might be subject to.  The note is true that 
Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway.
4.  Petrotemex.   Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel, 
unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to 
enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws 
specifically provide for these types of transactions.  We will not know this 
until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say "no" for 
Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with.
5.  PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an 
eligible swap participant (or "ESP").  CFTC regulation limits the derivatives 
trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain 
financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies, 
banks, etc).  Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth 
and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.  Whenever I say 
"not ESP" or "not eligible swap participant" it means they have not met the 
financial net worth test.
6.  The American Coal Company.  See prior note.

Attached are the revised online GTC's.  The weather GTC's won't change except 
for the credit support language, so I thought that you could make that same 
change when you made it to the rest of the GTC's.


Did we order that special UK sized paper?  I still have to copy that OMLX 
stuff for Mark Elliott's binder there in London.Louis Fernandez was wonderful to work with.  His work was top notch, his 
subcontractors did a great job.  For instance, I put in central air and one 
of the old window units we took out was in the brick in  front of my house.  
I thought when the brick got repaired I would  have this mismatched brick box 
they would look ugly from the front.  Louis's brick guy was so good that you 
cannot even tell the brick was repaired.  Also, his sheetrock guy did a 
wonderful job.  You cannot tell where he repaired sheetrock holes.

Louis is also a good businessman.  He gives you a weekly bill spelling out 
the exact number of hours he or his subcontractors worked and also listing 
any supplies he was billing you for.  A lot of contractors are not good 
businessmen.  I think Louis is honest about the time it will take to do a 
job, he communicates when he has a problem and how that might effect the 
cost, and I also think a lot of homeowners when they do construction have a 
lot of add ons they ask of the contractor, that they don't figure in his 
additional time or money on.  

To sum it up, I think with Louis you will get a good job for the money you 
pay.Just an FYI

About a year ago Kellie Metcalf had me send a sample ISDA Master to the 
referenced counterparty.  She has now left ECT to go with Azurix.  I got a 
call from the counterparty wanting to get some bids on some options and 
Kellie said to pass the trade down to John Suarez.  I called John and gave 
him the scoop and also told him we did not have a master in place and to 
treat this like any other counterparty, i.e. contact Credit for approvals 
before trading, etc.  I just wanted to give you a head's up, in case we get 
the trade, we're not surprised.That power shortage Friday cut us off in the middle of our conversation about 
the appropriate tax language to use for a confirmation evidencing a trade 
between Teeside Power Financing Limited and RMT.  I have attached the 
proposed form of confirmation.  I have combined in it the usual tax language 
we have in RMT confirmations along with the language we use in a cross-border 
trade between a Delaware corporation (usually ECT, now RMT) and company 
(Teeside Power) located in a treaty country acting exclusively through 
non-U.S. branches (England).  Please let me know if the tax language meets 
with your approval.
The 1st list attached here is the one I used for the 1st list you have.

Debbie/Tom,

Attached is a new version of the counterparty and product type matrix.  The 
counterparties are broken into three sections.  The first section contains 
counterparties that were included in credits original approved list with 
limits noted.  The second section contains counterparties that were included 
in credits second approved list without any limits noted.  The third and last 
section contains counterparties that will be included in the initial 
mailshot, but have not yet been reviewed by credit.  Please note that there 
are also new product types in row 7 that were not on any of the matrices you

and inserted next to similar product types.

Please call me with any questions/comments.

Hi Tana

We have entered into an ISDA Master Agreement with Caltex Trading Pte Ltd.    
As we need to put in place a proper resolution, could you please let us know 
whether you have any standard board resolution template so that we may also 
use it to pass the necessary board resolution?

Thanks

Per our discussion...
I had a conversation with Mark Taylor this morning about your board 
resolution.  He looked at the resolution we drafted for ECT International, 
and he said it would also cover the Singapore trading, so I have drafted a 
Secretary's Certificate and Incumbency Certificate for you to use.  With none 
of the Secretary's being located in Singapore, do you need my assistance in 
getting it signed here?  Who will you have sign the agreement?  What do you 
usually do?


Edmund,

Can you help us figure out who in London can help Anita execute her first 
ISDA, which also will include the usual Secretary's Certificates.  I don't 
know if you know, but Singapore doesn't need EEFT to sign as the arranger, 
ECTRIC can sign directly. Per the resolution, it needs to be a VP, President, 
Managing Director or Chairman.   It looks like the London based officers who 
could sign would be John Sherriff, Danny McCarty or John Lush (?), unless you 
are familiar with someone else who can sign for ECTRIC.  It looks like for 
the Secretary's Certificates, all the Secretaries are located here in 
Houston, so we should probably prepare them for the usual Kate Cole's 
signature.

Anita, you will need to have two signed copies, and initial both copies for 
signature, as also will your London Credit person.

Congrat Anita!  This is very exciting!

Hi Tana,

Thanks for your note ....which was totally helpful as usual.

This is the FIRST ISDA that we're executing here in Singapore so it's a Red 
Letter Day for us.  The process has been painfully slow mainly because of 
London Credit's reluctance to provide us with any credit terms unless the 
situation really demands for it.  We've got another one in the pipeline with 
one of the Shell affiliates though I'm not exactly holding my breath about 
it.  We'd sent them the draft last year and they've yet to revert despite us 
sending frequent reminders.  Not exactly on the top of their  list of things 
to do obviously!!!

Anyway - Caltex has executed the ISDA which we have in hand and what I would 
like to know is who is on the slate of signatories for ECTRIC.  Is there 
anyone in the London office who is authorised to sign the document otherwise 
we'll have ISDA couriered over to you in Houston.  If the document is to be 
executed in Houston, I'd be eternally  grateful if you could assist in 
getting the ISDA executed for us on ECTRIC's behalf as well as in obtaining 
the Secretary's signature for both certificates. I'll have my assistant 
Angeline coordinate with you on  the nitty gritties so that you'll know when 
to expect to receive the documents for execution.

Many thanks as always,
Anita

With respect to Online Trading, Mark wanted me to follow up with you re: 
insurance/reinsurance company issues.

Per our earlier conversations, I am saying "no" to online trading for all 
insurance/reinsurance companies we do not have a master with.  The online 
people have come back and said, hey wait a minute, you are already trading 
with insurance companies without a master, i.e. Swiss Re.  They are wanting 
to open up Swiss Re for online trading and any other insurance/reins. we are 
currently trading with without a master in place.   Do you have a list of 
those companies?   What are your feelings about that?  Can we trade online 
with Swiss Re?  How about any other insurance companies you are currently 
trading with without a master in place?  Or do you want me continue to say no?

Thanks for your help! Brent,

I am trying to track down the dealmaker on a deal in Argentina with Duke 
Energy International.  All I know is that Duke is trying to get a waiver from 
us on the confidentiality provision in the master swap agreement so they can 
use it on the Argentina deal.  Credit doesn't appear to know anything about 
the deal.  I'm don't even know if it is an EI or an ECT deal.  It may be EI 
because he mentioned the financing of a generator.  I don't want to waive 
anything until I track the business guy down.  Can you ask around and let me 
know.  Thanks!I looked at Gillian's website and she is adorable!  What a cutie!  I've 
bookmarked it and I'll keep looking for updates.  I'd like to attend!Mark asked me to contact you to get a copy of one of the letters we sent to 
outside counsel requesting updates on their legal advice to deal with the 
online trading issues.  We have to get similar letters out to some of the 
South American countries and Carribean tax shelter islands.

Much thanks!  By the way, weren't you out for vacation?  Did you have a good 
time?Leslie Hansen was out today so Elizabeth forwarded your language to one of 
our power attorneys in the Portland office for review.  I have some minor 
clean up changes from Elizabeth, but except any material changes to come from 
Christian Yoder in our Portland office.  As soon as I receive Christian's 
comments I will add forward them on to you.It just occurred to me after discussing online trading this morning with Mark 
for other countries, that I am approving online trading for Mexican 
counterparties we have a master in place with, however, in my later thinking, 
did our advice from Mexican counsel address the issue of enforceability of 
online transactions?---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 10/21/99 03:01 PM

Tana,

I have faxed to your attention some more issues with Tokyo-Mitsubishi 
documents.  Toky-Mitsubishi has sent a fax requesting a few things be added 
to our Confirmation.  The fact that the Master Agreement does not cover 
Commodity trades is not one of their problems (see below).  However, there 
are some Master related issues that they wish to have included in the 
Confirmation such as Market Disruption Events, Disruption Fallbacks, and a 
Non-Reliance provision.  As well as a couple of changes to our standard 
language ('first nearby month' rather than 'prompt month').

Let us know what you think of their comments.

Thanks,

Joe -

The Master Agreement with TM does not contemplate entering into Commodity 
Transactions. Confirms with this CP will require special language to be 
provided by Legal. Please make a note in Special Handling and contact Legal 
if any further trades comes down. Once we have the language, we will need to 
revise the Confirmation for the trade done 10/15, and Bob will need to create 
a special template for TM.

I have forwarded on your email and fax to Marie Heard.  She was already 
working on that issue, what a happy coincedence!When are you coming in?  When shall we have dinner?Below are my responses to your email:

1.  Masters that limit weather trading or contain another trading limitation 
in the master only:   per our conversation.
2.  CMS Marketing Services & Trading:  Trading is limited to fixed price 
swaps, basis swaps, swing swaps and options.  This limitation is contained in 
the Company's Trading Policy, which they have provided to us.   We cannot 
trade anything except the types of products listed in the trading policy.
3.  Venezuela:  per Mark's conv. w/Dave Forster, we do not want to pursue the 
due diligence on this country at this time.
4.  Phibro, Inc.:    see note #1
5.  Swiss Re:  See my note 11 below.
6.  Tokyo Mitsubishi:  We are preparing amendments that would be added to to 
the Online and regular confirmations when they go out to deal with the lack 
of legal terms in the master to do anything but interest rate and currency 
transactions.  This should solve our problem so we should be able to open 
them for trading any commodity.
7.  Trinidad & Tobago:  same comment as #3 above.
8.  UBS AG.  They recently sold their book and got out of the energy 
commodity business so we should not be doing anything but FX and interest 
rate transactions with them.  Their master is also trading limited, and we 
could not trade energy commodities with them without amending it or doing a 
fix similar to Tokyo Mitsubishi.
9.  Aspect Resources.  I discussed this one with Mark and Bill, and we have 
agreed to open up Aspect for all trading under the Master.
10.  Brant-Allen:  Their Board of Directors limited the trading we did with 
them to only the one trade we did under the master.  We cannot do any other 
trading with them without specific pre-approval via a new resolution from 
their Board of Directors.  So they are still "no" for online derivatives 
trading.
11.  Insurance Companies:  With respect to trading with insurance/reinsurance 
companies without a master in place, these types of counterparties have 
special authority/legal issues that the online trading process does not 
address.  When we do trades with this type of counterparty without a master 
in place we get legal opinions, guarantees, articles of incorporation & 
bylaws and other kinds of statutory documentation to evidence the approval 
for this type of counterparties doing these types of transactions.  All kinds 
of special representations are also added to the contract based on the type 
of counterparty.  We therefore have to continue to say "no" to online trading 
based on these special handling procedures.
12.  Cox and Perkins:  We could say "yes" to online derivatives trading, 
however, would have to treat them like any other counterparty we did not have 
a master in place with.
13.  Kinetic Resources.  Ditto comment 12 above.
14.  Midland Cogeneration.  Still under review as to regulated utility status.
15.  Praixair:  see comment #1 above.
16.  Tembec.  The bylaws of this corporation require that all contracts for 
this counterparty must be executed by two officers from a list they provided 
to us .  I spoke to Mark about this and they could not trade online unless 
their Password Application was signed by two of the officers as directed 
above.  Another way to solve this would be to get a special resolution from 
Tembec's board of directors allowing only one individual to sign the Password 
Application.  Either way, you cannot trade online without meeting these 
special signatory requirements.
17.  EW Scripps.  Same comment as #1 above.
18.  Maritime Electric.  Is a Canadian utility.  No Trading.

Critical Changes to my list:

1.  Mexico:  Per our conversation, we are contacting outside counsel to 
request legal advice as to whether online transactions are enforceable in 
Mexico.  However, we can still not do financial trading without having a 
master in place.
2.  Public Service Company of Colorado:  the person that signed the master 
appears not to have the authority to sign the master, so until we get this 
resolved, we are switching them to a "no".

Per my meeting today with Credit:

I've got 38 we disagree on, either as to whether they're a regulated utility 
or an eligible swap participant.  I'll be working on those tomorrow and will 
get back to you.

My Review of Your List:

List #1

1.  BP Exploration & Oil Inc.:  Originated from London Credit, missing from 
your list.  This is a counterparty that both Houston & London trade with.  
ECT has a master in place with them.  Trades would roll under the ECT 
Master.  The master is the old ECT Form of master that limits the trading to 
energy price swaps and options.  No weather.  Case of Credit override.5
2.  Elf Trading:  Both ECT and ECT International have masters in place and 
trade with this counterparty.  Mark was going to talk to Louise about what to 
do with these situations when we have more than one master in place.
3.  Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York:  We've got several overlapping 
issues I am going to have to talk to London about.  First, here in the U.S. 
Morgan got out of the energy commodity business.  We, in fact, "bought their 
book".  We actually couldn't "buy their book" because of our low credit 
rating relative to Morgan, so all their trades remain in place, 'tho all 
payments go in and out through us and we act as servicer for their commodity 
business.  Their master with ECT is bad, it only covers energy price swap 
(not options!) and does not have the trade option rep which means if we were 
to do an option transaction with them we would have to do a fix similar to 
the Tokyo Mitsubishi fix.  Saying all that, I don't know what, if any, 
trading Morgan continues to do outside the U.S.  I need to talk to London and 
find out.  So Morgan right now is a big open issue.
4.  Vitol S.A.:   Both Houston and London trade with this counterparty.  
Houston has a master with this counterparty.  Trades should be done under the 
master.  The master does not cover weather, so this would be another case of 
the Credit override.
5.  Missing counterparties from 1st list:   (1) Wisconsin Electric Power 
Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a utility, (2) 
Wisconsin Gas Company, no master in place, not approved for trading, it is a 
utility, (3) Wisconsin Power and Light Company, we do have a master in place, 
approved for all trading, except weather, which is not covered in the master, 
would have to be a Credit override, (4) Xeron, Inc., no master in place, 
approved for all trading.

List #2

1.  Cabot Oil & Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
2.  Callon Petroleum:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
3.  EIL Petroleum:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
4.  Fortune Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
5.  Plains Resources:  Missed "X" on all weather
6.  PXRE Corp:  deleted final set of weather, good for weather deals only
7.  St. Mary Land & Exploration:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
8.  Stratum Group:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
9.  Tempest Reinsurance:  deleted final set of weather, good for weather 
deals only
10.  Twister Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
11.  United Salt:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
12.  West Texas Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather

List #3

1.  Bargo Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
2.  Belco Oil & Gas:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
3.  Cross Timbers:  Missed "X" on all weather
4.  Encore Acquisition:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
5.  Norfolk Southern:  You've got them restricted for everything, I've got 
them as "OK" for everything
6.  RMS Monte Christo:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
7.  Sapient Energy:  Missed "X" on final set of weather
The Icon worked and I've pulled it up and can use it.  Thanks for your help!

How's things going there?  Are you getting excited about going back home?  
Have they started to think about hiring anyone to replace you?  Everything 
cool on the roommate front?We need to update the advice we received from Mexican counsel to address the 
online trading issue.  I spoke to Nony and while we're at it I'm also going 
to ask whether there are any other updates since they rendered their original 
advice.  Are there are other issue you would like to add to our request for 
advice?Bob Shults called this meeting to see what the status was for the different 
product groups' confirmation and GTC forms.  The two issues out of the 
meeting I was asked to bring to your attention were:

1.  Attaching the Online GTC's to the outgoing confirmations.  Per our 
discussion, it was my understanding that the GTC's would be attached to all 
outgoing confirmations.  That does not seem to be the general consensus.  
There seems to be feedback from London that is not the case, and Janice Moore 
was also saying she didn't know if that's what the liquids people were going 
to do.  Bob Shults asked for your direction with these holdouts.
2.  The issue of the credit in the masters being overriden.  First, after our 
discussions yesterday, we couldn't figure out a way they could change the 
approval status within Credit from approved with a master to a "B" approved 
GTC with credit.  Second, Bob Shults thought that had been agreed to have the 
credit overridefor all the product areas and I told him that financial was 
still discussing this issue with Credit, so we would have to get back to 
him.  I guess the physical people are OK with that.  I don't know what 
discussions you have had with Jeff and Alan, but Bob Shults appears to want 
to have this confirmed for him.

Also, along with the credit override of the master, there is supposed to be 
some letter that will be sent out to the counterparties.  Who will be 
drafting that letter and will it be the same for all product groups?Per the email below, do you have any other legal advice with respect to 
trading issues we should address with Mexican counsel when we send out the 
updates below.  Please let me know ASAP, we hope to get our letter out Monday.

Subject: Update to Mexico Advice

We need to update the advice we received from Mexican counsel to address the 
online trading issue.  I spoke to Nony and while we're at it I'm also going 
to ask whether there are any other updates since they rendered their original 
advice.  Are there are other issue you would like to add to our request for 
advice?








Thanks for the smiles!  I am busy this weekend, but if you're in town, how 
about doing the nickel tour and Village Shopping the next weekend?  If not, 
maybe another time when you are available.  Let me know...---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 10/25/99 01:36 PM

Subject: N34222 with Tokyo Mitsubishi

Tana,

Two options were done with Tokyo Mitsubishi on October 22.  The terms are:  
ENA sells a CALL of 100,000 Barrels of Brent Crude at $23 with a $0.46 
premium;  ENA buys a CALL of 100,000 Barrels of Brent Crude at $24 with a 
$0.20 premium.  I understand that special language is being prepared for a 
trade done on October 15, and believe that the same language will need to 
apply on these options.  Please contact me should you need further 
information.

Thanks,

Per Shari this a.m., we had already requested an update on Ritch, Heather's 
legal advice from another law firm in Mexico, Lopez Vallardi.  You have 
already authorized payment of the bill.  The fax requesting an update from 
Ritch, Heather went out yesterday.  What would you like to do?Shari said our new counsel was supposedly better counsel and that's why we 
asked for the update from them.In response to your email, yes, our confidentiality language was so limited 
that it did not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates of either 
party without consent.  We revised the form about 9 months ago to broaden the 
langage to include affiliates, but Duke is an old master so they need our 
consent so they can provide it to their affiliate.  Unless Federico has any 
reason not to waive the language, I think we can go ahead & draft a waiver up 
here and send it to Duke.  Can you talk to Federico asap and run that by him 
and let me know so I can get this over to Duke.  Thanks!Liz and Christian Yoder reviewed the description since you were out.Last week I left taped to your chair the referenced form of confirm that Bob 
Bowen needed you to sign off on.  He says he never hear back.  Can you call 
him and give him the sign off.  Thanks!Can you do me a favor and look to see if we are doing any financial trading 
with the following counterparties:

Florida Power & Light
Peoples Gas Light & Coke Company
Dakota Gasification Company
Hydro-Quebec
Enmax Corp.

Bob, there are a few others I am still re-reviewing, I will get back to you 
as soon as I resolve/answer my questions.How did we ever resolve the two signed masters situation for Elf Trading S.A. 
(ECT & ECt Int'l)?Another counterparty change, for Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited 
Partnership.  We will switch that to a "yes" but only if they accept online 
GTC w/o change.  This is the one where they wanted an exculpation clause for 
the partners, and that is totally unacceptable.I discovered it was a non-ISDA master, so I had to delete the weather.I just spoke to Sara Shackleton and she approved opening FPL for all 
financial trading.  She has also been discussing the utilities with outside 
counsel and we may be able to open more up for trading.  She is going to 
bring a copy of my list to the Legal Conference and review it, so hopefully 
we'll have some more changes for you next week.---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 10/28/99 09:57 AM

Subject: Forcenergy News





The following is reported today in one of the daily bankruptcy news services I
receive. I thought you might be interested in keeping up with Forcenergy's
bankruptcy case which appears to be headed toward confirmation with more than 
a
few hiccups along the way.

Forcenergy Wins Court OK Of Plan Disclosure Statement
Forcenergy Inc. on Oct. 22 won
bankruptcy court approval of the disclosure statement
related to its plan of reorganization.
Doug Walter of Andrews & Kurth, counsel to the
oil & gas producer, said that Judge Thomas M. Brahney III
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Orleans said he
would approve the disclosure statement after numerous
objections were resolved prior to last Friday?s hearing.
A final order has not been signed, but Judge
Brahney indicated his intent to sign the order at the hearing,
Walter added.
Walter said that Forcenergy hopes to begin
soliciting votes on the reorganization plan on Nov. 3.
Solicitation materials are currently being drafted.
Judge Brahney has scheduled a plan confirmation
hearing for Dec. 13.
As reported, the disclosure statement was amended
after the creditors? committee, while supporting the plan,
found the disclosure statement to be lacking information in
a number of areas. The document was amended to clarify
a few of the secured claims that will be paid in full in cash,
rather than over time.
The creditors noted that the plan proposes a
distribution to equity shareholders in an amount close to
50% of the current value of their interests, while unsecured
creditors will only receive close to 60% of the value of their
claims.
Baker Hughes Oilfield Operations Inc., Baker
Petrolite Corp. and Western Atlas International Inc. had
asserted in a Sept. 15 objection that the plan violated the
absolute priority rule and was thus not confirmable.
The Baker Hughes group also took issue with the
plan for lumping all lien creditors into one class. "The
Proposed Plan wholly fails to address the issue that the
various lien creditors have liens against properties which
may vary greatly in value," the Baker Hughes group said.
It added that the plan is thus not confirmable as the secured
claimants are not properly classified into separate classes
According to Walter, the disclosure statement was
revised to allow for four different treatments of around $34
million in miscellaneous secured claims.
Liens designated sub-class A, claims senior to
other secured claims, will be paid out in full in cash. Sub-class
B liens, those outside Louisiana, will be asked to
accept 85 cents on the dollar for their claims. Sub-class C
liens, those that attach in Louisiana, will be asked to accept
80 cents on the dollar for their claims. And, finally, all
other liens, those in sub-class D, may be challenged.
If sub-class D liens are found to be legitimate, they
will be paid in cash in full over time, or their collateral will
be returned to them. However, Forcenergy says it will not
return any collateral constituting a mineral lease.
As reported, Forcenergy?s plan of reorganization
is expected to provide holders of allowed general unsecured
claims with a 62% recovery through the distribution of
23.04 million shares of new common stock on a pro rata
basis.
On Sept. 22 the hearing on the adequacy of the
disclosure statement began. It was then continued until
Oct. 15, and then again to Oct. 22, in order to give the
company time to supplement the document and address the
objections.   --end--

To remind me to discuss this with you when you get in:

We received via our fax notices from the OMLX a request to provide them with 
information about our Y2K readiness.  When you have a minute let's look at 
the form together.  Probably Alan will have the answers.Pat, remember a few days ago I was trying to track down this Argentina power 
deal with Duke.  You might want to get in touch with Federico.

Mark, FYI, also, I don't know if there are any problems with power out of 
Argentina.

Federico Cerisoli is in discussions with Duke's Argentina office about doing 
a power swap.  Why they need a waiver for this I can not guess since the deal 
will still be between a Duke entity and ECT(since EI does not have a swap 
entity yet).  Is the confidentiality provision so narrow that they cannot 
show the master to affiliates?  Do they want to show it to a non-affiliated 
entity?  Any questions on the structure of the proposed deal can be forwarded 
to Federico.  Let me know if this helps.


To: Brent Hendry/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT @ ECT

Subject: Duke Energy International

Brent,

I am trying to track down the dealmaker on a deal in Argentina with Duke 
Energy International.  All I know is that Duke is trying to get a waiver from 
us on the confidentiality provision in the master swap agreement so they can 
use it on the Argentina deal.  Credit doesn't appear to know anything about 
the deal.  I'm don't even know if it is an EI or an ECT deal.  It may be EI 
because he mentioned the financing of a generator.  I don't want to waive 
anything until I track the business guy down.  Can you ask around and let me 
know.  Thanks!



I stopped by to see you because Mark got in the mail a blacklined draft of 
the prospectus from Bowne on the weather offering and I wanted to see if you 
got your own copy or do you need me to have one made for you.Now that the cat is out of the bag I can tell you about the other big project 
I have been working on.  The press releases went out last week.  Mark Taylor 
was also the host of this year's ECT Legal Conference (which takes alot of 
work to put together!), which we just had on Thursday and Friday.  

You may have read in the papers about our new Enron Online, our new web based 
commodity trading system.  You can view it at www.EnronOnline.com.  Mark has 
been the lead attorney on that project which has been an enormous amount of 
work for him.  Besides being Mark's aide-de-camp on EOL generally, I have 
been working on the counterparty approval lists for the financial contracts, 
which has meant going through every counterparty we have to determine whether 
we should approve them for online trading.  As you can imagine, that has 
meant looking at thousands of counterparties, contracts and legal issues and 
trading restrictions.

As far as my "Fishkin" project (as Mark and I call it), I recently went to an 
internal class on Project Management and am redefining my project goals, 
objectives, etc.  We've found a few new software programs we've been looking 
at, some we found out Enron already has.    Mark and I are discussing what 
we've seen, defining and redefining what we want, and hope to finalize our 
thoughts soon.

 Mark and I are currently designing the swap jurisdictional database in a 
Lotus Notes format, and hope this week to get the computer people to design 
the software.  This would be my database of foreign derivative laws, ISDA 
opinions and the like.  We need that up and going desperately.   We, have 
been having to look alot at foreign laws for the online trading project as 
well as general trading questions lately, and it should be a slam dunk to put 
this database together and start loading the information.

So that's been what I've been up to, let me know your thoughts about EOL!

P.S.  Thanks for the article!Just a note, you know, we more or less made the same changes to the 
Industrial Master that we made to the ISDA.  If you are using that form at 
all you should update it to include our changes.  I think Paul mentioned in 
his presentation at the seminar that you were using the Industrial as the 
basis form for Norway.  Anyway, if that is the case, we may need to look at 
that form.

See, you're always in my thoughts!  Missed you at the seminar.  I hope we'll 
see you at one of these soon!I hear you had dinner with our friend Molly Saturday night, what happened to 
the relatives?!When you have a minute, PECO called with an authorized trader list problem 
and Liz asked me to bring it to you for handling...Angeline

Will you be sending the ISDA Agreement for signature directly to Mark 
Frevert?  I'm asking because he will have to sign the incumbency certificate 
before Kate Cole, obviously, certifies to his signature.  How do you plan on 
doing this?  Perhaps we should have Edmund Cooper in London coordinate the 
signing.  What are your thoughts?I will send a copy to you!  We miss you...I called Edmund Cooper and he is out on vacation til Monday.   Do you think I 
should email him the certificate, have him print it out there in London, I 
guess Anita has to initial the two ISDA Master Agreements for signature, then 
Edmund could get them initialled by  Credit in London, and then bring the 
certificates and agreements up to Mark Frevert for signature.  What do you 
think?If you've got the copies, why don't you save them as a form into your system 
and use them to draft the Caltex Certificates.  Send them over to Edmund with 
the ISDA Master Agreements.  Leave him a message asking him if he could help 
you get the agreements and the incumbency certificates signed, then have him 
send the certificates to me for Kate's signature.  I think that should do it.Thanks for your email.   It is important on a going forward basis that if we 
veer from any restriction that Legal has placed on a counterparty (e.g. if 
Credit says it is ok to trade weather under a GTC instead of a master) that 
Legal hear before we trade so we all make sure we are on the same 
understanding as to whether any restriction should be waived.  In response to 
your email I have the following comments:

1.  The New York Times Company:  cannot trade derivatives online at all.  
Their board resolution and master agreement require that two specific 
officers must enter into the trade together on a telephone call.  They cannot 
trade any other way without revising their board resolution and agreement.  
All their  trades must be done by telephone.
2.  San Diego Gas & Electric Company:  the California PUC said that utilities 
such as San Diego cannot enter into derivatives transactions at all!
3.  Aspect Resources:  can enter into derivative transactions.  We want the 
transactions to roll up under the existing ISDA Master Agreement between ECT 
and Aspect.
4.  Brant-Allen Industries:  Is shut down, more or less, for all financial 
trading.  They cannot enter into another derivative transactions with us, 
either on the phone or online, until, prior to entering into the trade, they 
provide us with a board resolution approving the trade or derivative trading 
in general.  The board resolution they provided with the signed master 
agreement only approved the one trade we entered into at that time.
5.  Cox & Perkins:    We had a master with this counterparty and they have 
informed us i writing that they didn't want to trade with us anymore.  In 
reality, if they did another trade, Legal will need to be contacted and we 
probably would try and reactive the master and roll the trade up under the 
master if possible.  Credit, keep us informed if they do trade.
6.  Sonoco Products:  We should not be trading with them at all until we 
resolve this payment dispute.  Sara Shackleton was working on that.  We do 
have a master with them, and if we resolve the payment dispute and begin 
trading with them, the trade should roll up under the existing master.Pat,

This waiver has to deal with a provision in the ECT master swap agreement 
that requires that the agreement and its contents be kept confidential, 
except to certain people like auditors.  It did not allow the agreement to be 
provided to affiliates.  Duke wants to copy the terms of the master agreement 
in has in place with ECT and use it for this Duke Energy International that 
is doing the deal down in Argentina.  Duke Energy cannot even provide Duke 
Energy International with a copy of this agreement unless it gets ECT's 
permission to give them a copy of the agreement.  That it what I am trying to 
resolve, whether there is any business reason why we would not want to give 
Duke Energy International the right to look at that agreement.

Your issue, obviously, is what business Federico is doing.  My issue is more 
of a documentation/legal issue.---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 11/04/99 11:07 AM

Below are my comments to the Legal/Financial transactions only on the latest 
counterparty list:

1.  CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Co.- no Column L, cannot do basis 
transactions, that is floating, weather trades should all be approved, Column 
CF should be out, basis is floating, fixed price transactions only
2.  Elf Trading S.A.-should be approved for weather, why no weather?
3.  Lehman Brothers Commercial Corp.-weather should not be approved
4.  Power Authority of the State of New York-seems to be missing from list.  
What happened?
5.  Richardson Products II, Ltd.-please note, we just got in the signed ISDA 
Master Agreement this week
6.  UBS AG - approved for interest rate and currency only-should be 
restricted for all other products
7.  Abitibi Consolidated-please note, we got the signed ISDA Master Agreement 
in this week
8.  Cross Timbers Energy Services-missed no weather
9.  EIL Petroleum-missed no weather
10.  Trafigura AG - Column DZ, US weather CDD swap is ok, Column EB, HDD 
weather swap is ok
11.  Emerson Electric Co. - switching to approved for all products, it is not 
a utility.

Per my conversations with Bob Shults, I have been and am continuing to review 
our list of utilities with Sara Shackleton, outside counsel and the 
regulatory people.  I don't know when I will get you a revised list, but I 
hope to open a bunch of the investor owned utilities for general trading.Per my conversations with Credit, the referenced counterparty is the New 
Jersey incorporated sub of a German company, a liquids based counterparty, 
and they are an eligible swap participant.  We do not have a master agreement 
in place with them.  I am approving them for all financial trading.Per Peter's request...

Subject: Credit Worksheet

Tana:

Attached is a credit worksheet for Enertek that requires them to post an L/C 
in the amount of $50,000.  I assume that we will be confirming the deal under 
a deemed ISDA since the Master is not executed yet.  The deal was just done 
today by Jennifer Fraser.

Please call me if I am not clear on the worksheet.

Subject: Revised Online Weather GTC's

Attached are the revised drafts of the weather GTC's.




I have received the Unanimous Written Consent of the Board of Directors of 
Enron North America Corp. dated 11/10/99 appointing Dale Neuner and Robert 
Shults as agents and attorneys-in-fact to execute Password Applications on 
behalf of the Company  for online trading.  The original Consent will be sent 
to Kate Cole for inclusion in the corporate minute book and copies will be 
sent to Dale and Bob.

When signing the Password Applications, Dale and Bob should sign them as 
"Agent and Attorney-in-Fact".  In the absence of Dale or Bob, any V.P. or 
above can sign Password Applications (with initials from Legal).

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.Per the request of Lorna, attached is a blackline of that legal opinion.
I did see the IPI presentation and was pretty impressed.  The presentation 
was, obviously, more directed to the confirmation process, but I thought it 
could also help in the creation and management of master swap agreements and 
swap agreement form templates.  I need to talk to our confirm desk people to 
see what issues of concern they had in the confirm process that they were 
hoping this system could address.   They had one concept for form generation 
I think is central for the creation of confirmations and agreements.  The 
concept was this "data dictionary".  It made it all clear to me.

I spoke to them about the different areas of concern in my database asked 
them to prepare another presentation more focused on those issues and come 
back to us before I leave for Europe in June.Can you forward to Karen a copy of the lastest Electronic Trading Agreement.  
I'm not comfortable that what I have is the latest.  Much thanks!In order to deal with the online trading program as well as other issues that 
repeatedly arise, we need to make some modifications to our Master Swap 
Agreement Database.

Foremost, we would like to open the Master Swap Agreement Database to any 
ECT, ECT Canada or ECT International employee that would like access to the 
information.  This would include employees in the London, Oslo, Singapore, 
Portland  and Buenos Aires offices.  The only information we need to continue 
to restrict is the Legal and Credit comment section (attorney-client 
privilege issues).  Access to this information would continue to be limited 
to Legal and Credit  In addition, it also very critical that only Legal and 
Credit have access to the Portland General masters.

Second, we will need to add some drop downs to deal with online trading 
issues.  Online trading will commence by the end of the month and we need to 
have this information and access available by that time.

In addition, we have remaining "kinks" in the database we need to resolve.

Can you let me know when you would be available to meet to discuss the 
changes.  Thanks for your help!---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 11/12/99 11:34 AM

Per the request of Lorna, attached is a blackline of that legal opinion.


How about Wednesday at 10:00 am?Please find attached Annex B.doc.
Barry Tycholiz has asked me to confirm for you that we do have a master in 
place with Husky.  We do, indeed, and I will shoot a copy down to you.I faxed over some changes Thursday.  I deleted all references to ECT and ECT 
Legal Advisors being a party to the opinion.  Haedicke is an officer of ECT 
International, he is General Counsel and Managing Director, and so he can 
sign as such.  No need to pull ECT into the opinion when unnecessary.Mark wanted me to let you know he is reviewing your legal opinion and will 
call you with his comments.What is this email about?  Do I need to do anything?  Also, your attachment 
is unreadable because the columns are overlapping.I was told this was supposed to be an Omnibus, not a Deemed ISDA.It appears Susan Bailey still can not get in and edit the master swap 
agreement database.  She now has the icon, but no edit priviliges.  Can you 
please get her access.  Much thanks!I checked our records and we do not have any Master Swap Agreement with 
either K&N Marketing or Kinder Morgan.  Perhaps Credit knows something about 
this.  In addition, we cannot approve any merger documents until we get 
copies of the merger documents filed with the relevant Secretary of State.  
Marilyn Colbert usually provides them to us.Pam,

Per the email below, we will be terminating the transactions referenced below 
today.  Can you fax me the confirmations referenced in #1 below so I can make 
sure I have referenced them correctly.  Much thanks!

Subject: Bank of Montreal - Termination Transactions

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
SOLICITOR-CLIENT COMMUNICATION


Further to our conference call this evening, I confirm that Lavorato is quite 
keen to have the paper ready tomorrow for the termination of the BMO 
transactions to free up BMO credit availability with ECC and ECC's 
affiliates, which I can attend to.  

Before doing so, as I have had limited involvement to this point, I would 
appreciate if we could have a brief conference call respecting the 
documentation.  I understand the documentation should reflect the following:

1. termination by ENA of BMO transactions under ENA/BMO ISDA Master 
Agreement, transactions nos. N28388, N28977, N31021, N30817 and N32670;
2. termination payment from ENA to BMO of approximately Cdn. $10 million (to 
be confirmed);
3. termination payment is made by ENA on behalf of ECC (on what basis is to 
be confirmed, as transaction are between ENA and BMO); and
4. ECC repays ENA the termination payment pursuant to an inter-company 
transaction (on what basis is to be confirmed).

Regards, PeterAttached is the proposed form of Termination Agreement.   I have requested 
copies of the relevant confirmations from the Confirm Desk to confirm that 
the transactions are referenced correctly.  Please let me know if you have 
any comments. 
Mark Taylor asked if we could make one additional change to the database.   
He wants to move the "Restrictions" right after the counterparty name so it's 
the first thing the dealmakers see when the open an entry.

Thanks, we really appreciate your help!Please find attached form of Deemed ISDA.  When you fax it to the 
counterparty can you please attach to the back of the fax  IRS Forms 1001 and 
W-8.  Much thanks!
Mark asked if you could add something else.  Could you add an additonal drop 
down that follows "Legal Contacts that says "Historical Contacts".  We 
wouldn't want anyone else to see that but Legal and Credit.  Thanks!Peter,

Mark took a look at your termination and he thought it looked fine.  
Actually, he liked your termination and release better than the language we 
have in our form, so we're changing our form.  You are the man!

I checked the New York law when I drafted the termination so you're ok 
there.  

I'll be out all next week, my Mom's coming into town for the Thanksgiving

Thanks for the article.  I will distribute it to our group and Credit.  With 
Online Trading quieting down a bit, Mark and I are finally focusing on 
"Project Fishkin" (as we call it).  I am already getting a new database 
developed, the jurisdictional database, to keep track of swap laws around the 
world.  We hope to finalize our recommendations soon, and get the project up 
to Haedicke for his approval.

Of course, Online trading goes live today to our customers, so there's not

be helpful for our full distribution (Legal, Confirm and Others (settlements, 
Global Contracts, misc), if you would distribute a full list of the Enserch 
entities we wish to continue trading with and what business out of each 
entity.  I think this will stop people coming back and asking again and

Mark,

The City Of Riverside has mailed in a password application form to trade on 
EnronOnline (EOL).  This customer is considered a "muni" and we need to know 
if there are any legal restrictions (by product type) that would keep them 
from trading on EOL.  We would like to respond back to this customer as soon 
as we receive approval/rejection back from our legal, credit, and tax 
departments.

Please contact me with any questions.

Thanks for your help!

Peter,

I looked at the Banque Paribas Agreement.  It is an ISDA Master Agreement 
(Multicurrency-Cross Border) dated as of June 28, 1995.  The Agreement was 
executed between ECT and Banque Paribas.  Banque Paribas changed its name to 
"Paribas" on May 11, 1998, so I think you need to change the agreement  and 
signature line to read "Paribas, formerly known as Banque Paribas". or 
something to that effect.  The agreement is governed by New York law.Pam,

Peter Keohane, our Calgary attorney, is working on a termination of some 
trades between ECT and Paribas and needs you to fax or send him the following 
confirmations ASAP, Deal nos. EA7484.3 and EB3772.3.  

Thanks yet again!From what we have been able to determine, it appears that the City of 
Riverside is not authorized to invest in any types of financial derivatives.

Peter Keohane, our Calgary attorney, is working on a termination of some 
trades between ECT and Paribas and needs you to fax or send him the following 
confirmations ASAP, Deal nos. EA7484.3 and EB3772.3.  

Thanks yet again!
Thanks for your prompt help with this!  I know Peter appreciates it.I asked  Richard Ramirez if there was a business contact and he said he 
didn't know, but he was going to get back to me.   I think in his job in Fuel 
and Energy Risk Management, he is probably the business contact.  He probably 
makes the decisions about fuel purchases and derivatives hedging.  He also 
wanted to get a power enabling agreement in place.  I spoke to Liz Sager and 
she said we already had a power trade on the books and except for authority 
issues, there was no reason not to do financial energy.

As far as sending my Lotus Notes comment, I just did that manually.  I spoke 
to the Lotus Notes people before I went on vacation, and among other changes, 
they are going to try and fix it so we can just click on the email address 
and it will notify people to see Lotus Notes.  Of course, the only groups 
that will have access to the comment sections of Lotus Notes (for 
confidentiality purposes) will continue to be Legal and Credit.

But we are going to open everything but the comments and "priority" screens 
to any interested business people.  I'm going to move the "restrictions" bar 
right after the name so when the business people look the first thing they 
will see will be any restrictions.

Then, I'm going to add a drop down for online trading, approved or not, and 
then a comment screen (that only Legal and Credit can see) so we will have 
some notes about why we approved them or not (some of us are getting old and 
can't remember things!).I got a call from the Lower Colorado River Authority today asking us if we 
would like to put a power enabling and ISDA Master Agreement in place with 
them.  I spoke to Liz Sager and it appears we have already done a physical 
power trade with them.  Of course, we can still not do financial trading 
until we run through all the hoops with them.  I don't know who you directed 
your marketing package to, but he wanted some information on online trading 
and I said we would send him a packet.

Thanks!We have resolved the authority issue with referenced counterparty, and have 
approved all financial trading, including online financial trading, under the 
executed ISDA Master Agreement between ECT and this counterparty dated June 
23, 1999.In response to your email re:  Richardson Products II, this counterparty was 
approved for trading (without a master then in place) under my initial list 
of approved counterparties.  Per the email below, we then received in the 
signed master and the distribution was notified.

Subject: My comments to latest counterparty list

Below are my comments to the Legal/Financial transactions only on the latest 
counterparty list:

1.  CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Co.- no Column L, cannot do basis 
transactions, that is floating, weather trades should all be approved, Column 
CF should be out, basis is floating, fixed price transactions only
2.  Elf Trading S.A.-should be approved for weather, why no weather?
3.  Lehman Brothers Commercial Corp.-weather should not be approved
4.  Power Authority of the State of New York-seems to be missing from list.  
What happened?
5.  Richardson Products II, Ltd.-please note, we just got in the signed ISDA 
Master Agreement this week
6.  UBS AG - approved for interest rate and currency only-should be 
restricted for all other products
7.  Abitibi Consolidated-please note, we got the signed ISDA Master Agreement 
in this week
8.  Cross Timbers Energy Services-missed no weather
9.  EIL Petroleum-missed no weather
10.  Trafigura AG - Column DZ, US weather CDD swap is ok, Column EB, HDD 
weather swap is ok
11.  Emerson Electric Co. - switching to approved for all products, it is not 
a utility.

Per my conversations with Bob Shults, I have been and am continuing to review 
our list of utilities with Sara Shackleton, outside counsel and the 
regulatory people.  I don't know when I will get you a revised list, but I 
hope to open a bunch of the investor owned utilities for general trading.
Yes, I had already approved them for trading without any restrictions.  When 
I got the signed master in, it just meant that the confirmations now took a 
different path.

Something that yall will find helpful... I've been working with the Lotus 
Notes people in upgrading our current Master Swap Agreement database, and 
once its finalized we will be opening view access to anyone who wants it.  I 
am adding drop downs for "approved for online trading", so you will be able 
to confirm our approval, als, contract information which is currently 
provided on a monthly basis will now be available at all times.  I think 
other groups that rely on our contract information, Credit, Settlements, 
Global Contracts, EOL, dealmakers, or anyone else (at ECT or ECT Canada for 
confidentiality purposes) will now be able to be seeing what we're seeing in 
terms of the financial contacts.

I was told my prototype would be done by the end of the week, and then we'll 
have to test it, but hopefully this information will be available soon.  I 
hope this is helpful!In response to your email, an amendment to the referenced executed ISDA 
Master was sent by Susan Bailey to the Counterparty on 11/23/99.  With 
respect to the credit, this amendment provides for an increase in the 
Counterparty Exposure Threshold from U.S. $3,000,000 to U.S. $5,000,000, and 
amends one of the MAC provisions for Counterparty by increasing 
Counterparty's Net Worth from CAD$85,000,000 to CAD$150,000,000.  Certain 
other changes are being made to agreement including amending certain of the 
the LC provisions, as well other changes to legal terms that will incorporate 
our recent form changes.  THIS AMENDMENT HAS NOT BEEN EXECUTED.

Other credit in the agreement not being amended includes 3rd party debt 
default for Counterparty of CAD$5,000,000 and U.S. $50,000,000 with respect 
to Enron Corp., an Exposure Threshold for ECT Canada of $10,000,000, and a 
MAC for ECT Canada tied to a drop in Enron Corp.'s Credit Rating below "BBB-" 
from S&P.  The other MAC for Counterparty that is not being changed is if 
Counterparty's ratio of its Funded Debt to Net Worth is more than 1 to 1.

I hope that helps...let me know if you need more info or if you need me to 
fax these documents to you.1.  Vitol S.A., Inc. - already approved for financial trading this morning, 
master in place.
2.  Nicor Enerchange-approved for financial trading, no master in place.
3.  Helmerich & Payme Energy Services, Inc.-approved for financial trading, 
no master in place.
4.  Ashland Speciality Chemical Company-is a division of Ashland, Inc.  
Ashland, Inc. is approved for financial trading, no master in place.  CONFIRM 
DESK:  WHEN THESE CONFIRMS GO OUT, we consider this counterparty to be 
Ashland, Inc.  We want Ashland, Inc. to show up as the company name and on 
the signature line.  If the counterparty wants the division name there, we 
can sign it "Ashland, Inc., acting through its Ashland Speciality Chemical 
Company division", but we want the company name there and on the hook.

Why were the counterparties on your latest list under the Legal tab different 
from those under the Credit tab?The counterparties below for review are under the Credit approval tab.  
Please let me know ASAP if they are approved to trade.

Attached is another list for approval.  Under the comments section, if it 
says "declined" you do not need to review it because Credit has not approved 
the counterparty to trade, if it says "division" it means that it is a 
division, and Credit has already approved it to trade under the counterparty 
name to the right, if it doesn't say anything, it means it has been approved 
to trade and those are the counterparties you should be reviewing.

I still do not appear to be getting copies of all credit worksheets.  Please 
remember to keep me on this distribution.If you open in "view" you will be able to see it.  Thanks for your prompt 
response!You get a gold star for the week!That seems reasonable to me!  Ask the Swap Paralegals, no matter what the 
problem is, my answer is "well, you know what that means..." and they all 
respond "we can go home!".  If they only made me boss...In connection with Enron Online, please add the following people to your 
email distribution list for new contracts or any contract or counterparty 
change:  Karen Lambert, Frank Davis, and Carrie Southard.Attached please find a proposed form of Termination Agreement for Canadian 
Imperial Bank of Commerce.  Obviously, we need to still input the trades.

Peter,

It appears that our signers on the trading floor will be offsite in PRC 
meetings on Thursday.  I need to know ASAP when we plan on signing this 
because I am going to have to call around to find an officer that might be 
in.I forget my attachments all the time.  Sorry!

Attached is the consolidated list of counterparties for the week ending 
12/3.  All other lists sent to you by various people this week can be 
ignored.  If a counterpartys says "declined" by Credit, you don't need to 
look at it.  If there is nothing in the box it means "approved" and, as of 
today, look at "divisions" which means they are trading out of a division  
The "division" issue is up in the air and is being looked at on a going 
forward basis.

Per my agreeement with each of the physical groups, IF I DO NOT HEAR FROM YOU 
IN ONE DAY, I WILL ASSUME THE COUNTERPARTY IS APPROVED TO TRADE ALL THE 
PRODUCTS THAT CREDIT HAS APPROVED FOR THAT COUNTERPARTY.  We rarely expect 
counterparty issues from the physical trading groups, most of the 
counterparty issues will be with the financial trading counterparties.  I 
ONLY NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A COUNTERPARTY.

Most of the physical trading group's issues will revolve around which 
contract to use, and that should be resolved directly with Global Contracts, 
in the same way you resolve such issues on an "off-line" basis.

Credit is redoing the 12/6 and 12/7 lists they sent to me earlier, and I will 
forward them to you as soon as I receive them.

What is was is that the document was in Word 95 and we work in Word 97, so I 
just had to go in and open Word 95.  I think what you are doing is what they 
are trying to get up and going here in Houston, but they're not ready yet.  
Mine and Mark's questions to you is who goes down the Legal List and says yes 
or no to trading?Just a note to Group after discussion w/paralegals and Mark:  on a going 
forward basis if our counterparty is a hedge fund, we will ask for all 
corporate documents, plus a copy of their prospectus (which should show us 
what the fund is allowed to invest in).Shawna and I are both sitting here so excited to get your note.  Are we 
available?  For Chapman?  Of course!!!  Shawna's answer is...both nights, 
many festive drinks!  We are only limited by the thought of choosing just one 
night over the other!  If we have to, we will.  We leave the choice to you, 
because we are available either night...

Below is an email Dovie sent out a while back referencing the procedures for 
sending out NDA's.  When you need an NDA, please email me the following 
information.  I then contact a paralegal that maintains a database of our 
NDA's to check for conflicts.  Once we've done that I will prepare and send 
out the NDA as directed by you, then work with you as appropriate in the 
particular client situation to get the NDA back signed.  Once it is fully 
executed I need to send the original to the same paralegal here who is the 
central gatekeeper of all NDA's.  

My number is x33399 if I can assist you with anything.

Group-

Earlier this week, we met Tana Jones (Senior Legal Specialist) and Leslie 
Hansen (Legal Counsel) with ENA (servicing ENW) to discuss the process for 
executing NDAs.  Leslie will serve as in-house legal counsel for EMS while 
Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all documentation such as NDAs.

There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is 
bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business 
information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly 
articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is 
the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact 
Tana via email (tana.jones@enron.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the 
following information:
 1.  Which form you would like to use
 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared
 3.  Counterparty's legal name
 4.  Counterparty's address
 5.  Contact name at Counterparty
 6.  How/where to send NDA and appropriate information (fax or email and 
number or address).

My understanding of this NDA is that London gave it directly to Craig Chaney 
to get executed by the counterparty.  So, David, I think you need to get a 
copy from Craig, and then forward a copy on to me.

How did it get to be that these people are drafting their own NDA's.  I 
thought our agreement when we met with Dovie Keptra was that I would draft 
them.  I would prefer every time not to have to figure out what they've

Thanks for the info.  I'll amend the P&G status to include physical only 
until we hear something that makes us more comfortable trading financially.

Subject: Re: ClickPaper approvals, 12-19-00  

We may want to rethink allowing P&G to trade on Clickpaper for financial 
business.  We have been trying to negotiate an ISDA with P&G for well over a 
year, to no avail.  While they are a great credit, they have issues with our 
no reliance clause in our documents which is a HUGE legal issue and they were 
involved in a large derivative lawsuit with Bankers Trust several years ago.  
This may be one for legal to decide, but my vote is against until there is an 
ISDA to confirm trades under.

Thanks,
Tanya

Also, please add a lawyer in our Group to the database with full edit

Thanks!Kimball, Bay State and The Energy Authority were all amendments, even tho 
Credit didn't have them marked as such.  Kimball, I am ok with the change 
adding physical gas, they were previously shut down for financial and power, 
and no change there.  Bay State was previously shut down for financial and 
power, no change there, OK with adding physical gas.  The Energy Authority, I 
had previously shut down for financial, open for all power.  Now, per Leslie, 
have them open for US power sells only, so I'm changing that.

Hetch-Hetchy Water and Power is a division of the City of San Francisco, so I 
am shutting them down for all financial.

Please be advised that the Exchange has received CFTC approval for further 
amendments to natural gas price limits.  Members were previously advised in 
Notice # 429 (December 18, 2000) that these changes were pending CFTC 
approval.

These changes will become effective as of the start of the RTH session on 
Friday, December 22, 2000. A copy of amended NYMEX Rule 220.08A (SPECIAL 
PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES) is included below in this 
Notice. The amendments to this rule add a new Section (E), which concerns the 
last three days of trading in the spot month; the amendments also make 
related conforming changes.

In view of the recent price movement in the Natural Gas contract, the 
Exchange is amending the applicable price limit rules as follows:

(1) There shall be no price limits for any Natural Gas futures contract month 
during the RTH session on the last three trading days of the current delivery 
month, i.e., spot month.

(2) By comparison, price fluctuation limits shall remain in effect for all 
contract months for the NYMEX ACCESS(r) sessions conducted on these three 
trading days as provided by Exchange rules and as further modified by 
applicable resolutions.

Thus, on Friday, December 22, on Tuesday, December 26, and on Wednesday, 
December 27, 2000, there shall be no price limits in effect for any Natural 
Gas futures contract months during the entire RTH session on those trade 
dates.

In other words, prices shall move on an unrestricted basis during the entire 
floor trading session on those three trade dates, and there shall be no 
trading halts triggered at any time during such sessions.

As a reminder, an Executive Committee Resolution is still in effect that 
amends on a temporary basis existing price limit rules by expanding the price 
limits on NYMEX ACCESS (for all contracts listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESS 
that have price limits). The Resolution will remain in effect until February 
1, 2001, unless Members are notified otherwise by the Exchange. For your 
convenience, a copy of the Resolution is also included in this Notice.

If you have any questions concerning the new rule amendments, please contact 
George Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; 
Rob Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.

NATURAL GAS: APPROVED AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX
RULE 220.08A. SPECIAL PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR NATURAL GAS
FUTURES

Rule 220.08A. SPECIAL PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR NATURAL GAS
FUTURES
(A) Initial Price Fluctuation Limits for All Contract Months. At the 
commencement of each trading day, there shall be price fluctuation limits in 
effect for each contract month of this futures contract of $1.00 per MMBtu 
above or below the previous day's settlement price for such contract month.

(B)(1) Triggering Event and Temporary Trading Halt. If a market for any 
contract month is traded or, is bid in the case of upward price moves or is 
offered in the case of downward price moves, for five (5) minutes 
consecutively at the upper or lower price limit, as applicable, then a 
Triggering Event will be deemed to have occurred.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this rule, as a result of such Triggering 
Event, the market will be given notice immediately that in two (2) minutes, 
there will be a fifteen (15) minute temporary trading halt in all contract 
months of that futures contract and the associated option contract 
("Temporary Trading Halt"). The market will remain open during this 
two-minute notice period, and the commencement of the Temporary Trading Halt 
shall not be affected by market activity occurring during this notice period.

(3) Expansion of Limits Following Temporary Trading Halt. Following the end 
of the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, the market shall reopen in all 
contract months of this futures contract.  When trading resumes, price 
fluctuation limits for each contract month, except as otherwise provided in 
this rule, shall be expanded to $2.00 per MMBtu above and below the previous 
day's settlement price for such contract month.

(4) Following resumption of trading after a Temporary Trading Halt, there 
shall be no additional trading halts and no further expansion of price limits 
for the remainder of the trading day.

(C) Duration of Session Following Temporary Trading Halt.   When trading 
resumes after a Temporary Trading Halt, trading generally shall continue 
until the regularly scheduled closing time subject to the following 
exceptions:

1) if, at the start of the 15-minute Temporary Trading Halt, there is less 
than 15 minutes before the close, then, when trading resumes after the 
Temporary Trading Halt, the trading session shall be expanded as necessary to 
provide for fifteen (15) minutes of trading following the resumption of 
trading, and the closing period shall be the final two minutes of trading of 
this 15-minute period of trading; and

provided however that if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed 
during  the closing period, there shall be no Temporary Trading Halt for any 
contract month and no expansion of price limits for any contract month.

(D) Application of Price Fluctuation Limits to NYMEX ACCESS(r) The limits 
described in this rule shall apply to trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r), except as 
provided by NYMEX Rule 6.56 and except that:

(1) if the five-minute Triggering Event is completed during the last ninety 
minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS(r) trading session, there shall be no Temporary 
Trading Halt and no expansion of price limits during the remainder of such 
NYMEX ACCESS(r) trading session, and

(2) there shall be no Temporary Trading Halt during a NYMEX ACCESS(r) trading 
session if, in the opinion of the President of the Exchange or his designee, 
either the Triggering Event was not reflective of otherwise prevailing market 
conditions or a Temporary Trading Halt is unwarranted.

(E) Exception for Last Three Trading Days of an Expiring Contract Month.

(1) RTH Session on Last Three Trading Days. Notwithstanding the preceding
sections of this rule, there shall be no limitations on price fluctuations 
for any Natural Gas futures contract month during the entire RTH session of 
the final three trading days in the current delivery month.

(2) NYMEX ACCESS( Session on Last Three Trading Days. Price fluctuation limits
for all Natural Gas futures contract months on these three trading days shall 
remain in effect for the NYMEX ACCESS( session as provided by this rule.

APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby

Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for 
each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r) and that 
has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below 
with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS(r):

The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange 
futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the 
initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two 
contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the 
applicable rule.

This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limits) 
shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract.

In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide 
bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low price 
fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r) shall be halted immediately 
except as directed otherwise by the President or the President's designee.  
Following resumption of trading, the price limits in effect shall be 200% of 
the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched 
during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS(r) session, the market shall be 
halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter

In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r) traded 
for five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session at a price 
fluctuation limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the 
RTH session shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided 
under the applicable rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading 
occurred during the NYMEX ACCESS(r) trading session.

Tana,

It seems that NatWest has been acquired by the Royal Bank of Scotland.  They 
sent Novation paperwork to Mark Taylor.  Do you know if/when we will be 
Novating our swaps to the Royal Bank of Scotland?  Thanks for your help.We have several ISDA with Lehman Brothers.  Attached is an Icon that will 
allow you to view the Financial Trading Agreement Database, which all the 
Legal Dept., including the London Legal Dept. should use to track their 
financial master agreements.  Matt Dawson know how to use this database, if 
you need to visit with him.

		 Subject: EOL Deals between EPMI and RMT

We have recently traded a few deals between EPMI Long Term California and 
Risk Management and Trading Corp. The way these are booked now indicates that 
a Confirm will need to be generated between the two. Joe Hunter thinks that 
these should probably be book to book transactions. The EPMI Long Term 
California entity has not been used for financial nat gas transactions before 
this. Can you shed some light on to whether or not EPMI should be considered 
a subsidiary similar to ECC or EES.

Thanks.

We have received the executed Non-Disclosure Agreement between Enron Net 
Works LLC and EnronOnline, LLC and the referenced Counterparty dated 
12/28/00.  Copies will be distributed.Dave,

Per your conversation with Mark last week, it appears the Confirmation Desk 
people are still waiting for the "oops trade" language.

We never received any language from any EOL individual.  We have not 
discussed revision language for EOL deals with Legal or EOL.

Kevin,

Is there some specific revision language that we've been given by the EOL 
group for use with revised EOL deals?

Legal is claiming that we should have received something long ago from 
someone on the EOL side, but I don't recall ever getting anything.

Thanks,
Joe

From an earlier email from Dovie Keprta:

Earlier this week, we met Tana Jones (Senior Legal Specialist) and Leslie 
Hansen (Legal Counsel) (Leslie will be on maternity leave soon, so  Mark 
Greenbery will be the new lawyer contact) with ENA (servicing ENW) to discuss 
the process for executing NDAs.  Leslie/Mark will serve as in-house legal 
counsel for EMS while Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all 
documentation such as NDAs.

There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is 
bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business 
information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly 
articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is 
the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact 
Tana via email (tana.jones@enron.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the 
following information:
 1.  Which form you would like to use
 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared
 3.  Counterparty's legal name
 4.  Counterparty's address
 5.  Contact name at Counterparty
 6.  How/where to send NDA and appropriate information (fax or email and 
number or address).Someone must be cleaning out their office, because a notice of a 
restructuring from Black Stone Holdings Parnership mysteriously showed up on 
my desk, with no note.  I have no idea if Credit knows about this BECAUSE IT 
IS SO OLD!

The notice dated 4/19/99, says effective 7/1/98, Black Stone Holdings 
Partnership transferred all of its assets and liabilities to Black Stone 
Minerals Company L.P., a Delaware Limited Partnership.

Let me know whether or not Credit knew about this already...if not, I'll send 
a copy down to you.  It was my understanding from way back when that they 
were no longer trading under the Blackstone financial master, so this may be 
moot.  If we are trading with them again, we never did get the corporate 
documents on the partnership from them and we may want to use this as an 
excuse to get them.As you requested...

The wheels of DeutscheBank turn very slowly.  It appears their Credit guy 
didn't communicate our agreement regarding Specified Entities to his legal 
team, so Sara Shackleton said they are confirming that information before 
they send a revised draft.  Further, he said all changes have to be sent to

Tana,

Thanks for keeping us updated on the Deutsche negotiations.  If, as you
suggest, Deutsche can prepare a Master for the EnronCredit.com Limited
Master as the docs are on their system then this would be useful, and I
will
review and comment on those.  The one thing they will need to ensure as you
mentioned is that the Master Agreement is governed by English law.  In
addition, I  am not sure if you have put a CSA in place with Deutsche, but
if you have (presumably a Paragraph 13 under the NY law CSA?) we would need
the corresponding Paragraph 11 to the English Law CSA.

Many thanks again and we look forward to progressing this matter.

Kind regards,

Clare

Unless otherwise noted on a going forward basis... unless I specifically 
mention a physical product, all physical counterparties will be approved for 
all the products that Credit has approved them for.  If I have an exception, 
it will be noted, otherwise CONSIDER THAT THE RULE.  Most of the comments I 
will have relate to financial counterparties:

For Financial

I am not responding to Credits "declined" counterparties.

1. AEC Storage and Hub Services, a business unit of Alberta Energy Company 
Ltd.  BAD NAME.  There is an ISDA Master in place between ECC and Alberta 
Energy Company Ltd.  I will approve financial trading with this Counterparty 
if the Confirms go out under that name.
2.  Ashland Speciality Chemicals Company, a division of Ashland Inc.  We are 
currently negotiating a master with this counterparty.  We earlier sent out a 
draft under a division name, and the counterparty came back and told us to 
change the name to Ashland, Inc.  So, if we trade under the Ashland, Inc. 
name, I can approve it for financial trading.
3.  Bayer Inc., Rubber Division-BAD NAME.  I have already approved trading 
under Bayer Corporation.
4.  Coast Energy Group, a division of Cornerstone Propane, L.P. - turning 
down to trade financial because we have already approved them for financial 
trading under Cornerstone Propane, L.P.
5.  Southwestern Energy Services Company-is a division of Southwestern Energy 
Company.  We have an ISDA Master in place with Southwestern Energy Company, 
which I will approve for financial trading under that name.
6.  Tenaska Marketing Canada, a division of TMV Corp.-already approved 
trading under TMV Corp.
7.  Trammochem, a division of Transammonia Inc. - BAD NAME.   I already 
approved them on the first list, and their master is in the name of 
Transammonia Inc., acting through it Division Trammochem.  FIX NAME!

For Power

1.  City of Riverside - per Leslie Hansen, they are permitted to trade  
pursuant to a GTC with collateral - subject to recieving override letter.
I knew that, I must've had a brain drain!

Bad news.  We got the Deutsche Bank documents in and they weren't signed by 
them yet, and none of the supporting documentation was provided.  So, I think 
we are going to be on the longer side of the execution timetable vs. the 
shorter side...

Can you draft a BETA and Fee Agreement for NatSource LLC.  Terms of the deal 
include:

$250,000 License Fee
We have received copies of a Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware 
Secretary of State on 12/22/00, effective 12/31/00, wherein El Paso Merchant 
Energy-Gas, L.P. (Global Counterparty #72297), a Delaware limited 
partnership, merged with and into El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. (Global 
Counterparty #53350), a Delaware limited partnership, with El Paso Merchant 
Energy, L.P. (Global Counterparty #53350) as the surviving corporation.

By virtue of this merger, the ISDA Master Agreement dated 12/01/99 should now 
reflect El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. as the Counterparty.  In connection 
with this merger, Credit will be getting a new parent guaranty from the 
Counterparty.  Upon its receipt, copies will be distributed.

Copies of the Certificate of Merger will be distributed.
Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

Pertaining to the email below--I spoke to El Paso this morning about the 
gty's (there are a total of 3 in question covering financial and physical 
deals w/ENA, HPL, and EPMI).  They agreed to have those three amended to 
include the name El Paso Merchant Energy, LP (as they only include Gas, LP).  
This is what their Legal is recommending in order to have the gty amendments 
executed ASAP and to make it as clean as possible (since 2 of the 3 gty's are 
tied to contracts).  Also, the amendments will be made effective as of 
12/31/00.

Let me know if you think we should ask for completely new gty's.

Futures Contract:  Henry Hub Natural Gas.

Contract Months: April 2001 and all Subsequent Contract Months.

Rate Change:

NYMEX Division Margins for the April 2001 Contract and all Subsequent
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts

Effective Date:    Monday, January 8, 2001 (close of business)

Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):            Old:  $7,000  New:  $5,000

Member Customer (Initial Margin):                Old:  $7,700  New:  $5,500

Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):            Old:  $9,450  New:  $6,750

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by 
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads 
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the 
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.

Because there is a difference between the outright margin required for the 
February 2001 and March 2001 delivery months and other months, each spread 
which includes one leg in either the February 2001or March 2001 delivery 
months will have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at 
$11,500 starting on Monday, January 8, 2001.  This figure is determined as 
follows:

Example at Clearing Member Rates

One Long February 2001 or March 2001 NG    (1 x $14,000)   =        $14,000
One Short April 2001 - January 2004 NG       (1 x $5,000)    =   -     $  
5,000
Net Scan Risk                         ($14,000-$5,000) =        $  9,000
Spread Rate                          (1x $2,500)     =   +     $  2,500
Total Requirement                                 =        $11,500

NYMEX Division Margins on Natural Gas Futures Spreads:
Requirements for Spreads with One Leg in February 2001 or March 2001 
Contract,  and One in the April 2001 Contract or Subsequent Contracts

Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):               $11,500

Member Customer (Initial Margin):                   $12,650

Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):               $15,525

Should you have any questions regarding these changes, please contact Arthur 
McCoy at (212) 299-2928 or Joe Sanguedolce at (212) 299-2855.  This notice 
supersedes all previous notices regarding outright margins for the NYMEX 
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract.

Just as I suspected.  I showed the attached email to Mark Taylor, and he says 
he still wants to send out confirms, so if Dynegy wants to just throw them 
out, that's their business, but keep sending them as you would in the normal 
course of business.

		 Subject: DYNEGY DIRECT

Stephanie,

We currently do a couple of deals per day through an Online trading system 
called DynegyDirect.  This is basically Dynegy's version of EOL.  We are 
sending Confirmations on these deals just as we do with all other deals done 
with Dynegy.  However, the CP is requesting that we not send these Confirms 
at all.  Our Traders click on the deal which is then legally binding.  Our 
back office personnel double-check our Trade Entry by going to DynegyDirect's 
web-site and checking the trade details.  Dynegy simply throws out our 
Confirmations once they determine it relates to a DynegyDirect deal.  I have 
told the CP that I would check with our legal dept about the status of 
sending Confirmations traded on DynegyDirect.

Let me know if you can get someone to comment on this.

thanks,
Joe

Subject: DYNEGY DIRECT

Dynegy is wanting to know if we can show "Dynegy Direct" on our confirms in 
the same way that we show "EOL".    Dynegy has two separate systems, one for 
Dynegy Direct and one for their 'daily' work, and because no confirms are 
signed and returned or sent out,  our confirms are confusing when they do not 
find them in their system.  Thanks.

I think I have the most recent verison of the North American ETA and PWA on 
my system, but just to be sure, could you send copies to me via e-mil?  I 
just want to make sure that I am sending out the correct version.  Some 
potential customers of EnronOnline want to see what they would be required to 
sign to have access to the system.

Dear Tana,

Since we last discussed the above, I think I have only formally approved one 
Japanese counterparty.  I am a bit concerned that something may be slipping 
through the system.  Alternatively, no companies other than those on the 
initial list have applied for passwords.  The metals people here came to see 
me about one company recently but I have not been asked for approval re that 
company formally yet.

Thanks.

What a happy coincidence about the book!  We'll have to share thoughts when 
we're done reading it.  The New York Times gave it a rave review, which made 
it so popular it was sold out for quite some time.

I've had to scold our buddy up there in the frozen north.  He's having to 
work on a master physical/financial netting agreement for a Canadian 
counterparty and has been calling me to ask basic ISDA questions that were 
covered in my class.  I told him if you two were paying more attention 
instead of clowning around so much...oh well, good thing I can't get him with 
a ruler up in Canada!  

Take care, and I'll look forward to chatting with you...can you send me the deal terms like we've done before so I can prepare an 
assignment.  Thanks!

		 Subject: Bandwidth Master Contracts

Attached below is a spreadsheet report of Bandwidth contracts in the Global 
Contracts database.  As we agreed, the Bandwidth group either has or will set 
up new EBS Contract numbers for each of these agreements, provide the new EBS 
Contract number for EOL Reporting, and provide specific notations and 
information regarding inactivation of the Global Contracts database records 
so that we don't have 2 "master" numbers for any given contract.   



I do not have edit access to Bandwidth contract records in Global and it is 
my understanding that the Bandwidth group no longer uses Global -- therefore 
none of us involved in this process will have appropriate security rights to 
inactivate the Global database records.  I will request appropriate security 
access to inactivate the records.  Then, when instructed via e-mail from a 
member of the Bandwidth team, I will inactivate the Global Contract database 
records.

Our agreement is that I will continue to report Bandwidth master contract 
information to EOL until Profile Manager is in production -- with the 
understanding from EOL that I cannot see the contract data reported for 
Bandwidth masters contracts.----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 01/10/2001 01:36 PM -----

I confirmed that Powerex Corp. is the new name of British Columbia Power 
Exchange Corp.  Since there was just a name change, Powerex Corp. should have 
the same profile for US physical power as B.C. -- accordingly, Powerex Corp. 
is authorized to trade US West physical power only (NOT EAST power) pursuant 
to the WSPP Agreement.

Please let me know if you have any further questions about this counterparty.

September1998. I understand you need to check that we ,as an Affiliate are

Apologies for the late notice

Per my earlier email, are we trying to get Koch Hydrocarbon Co. changed to 
reflect the legal entity as part of the counterparty name?
I just got off the phone with Aquila's Kansas City attorney about online 
trading issues and he said he would like to get an ISDA Master in place with 
us.  He said the contact to negotiate is their Calgary attorney, Carissa 
Browning at (403) 543-7188.   I told him I would pass on the request to our

On the attached list:

CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company:  Credit is opening them up for 
Can & US gas, which I am fine with.  I already had them open for financial.  
Make sure they're shut down for physical power.

Westpac:  I just approved that one on the 1/5/01 list.  There should be no 
changes from that list.  Enron Australia has an ISDA Master in place with 
them, as does ENA, so we are OK with them transacting all financial,

1,  1990  and  October 31, 1999  as  of   December  10, 1999  has  reached

This  is  record  territory  due  in  no  small  part  to  teams  working

Are you drafting this NDA for us?  I have already prepared a draft based off

have asked Rose to initial for Net Works (Mark, hope this is ok; this is same

Mark Greenberg, and attorney in our Group, has reviewed your comments and 
made some minor changes.  If these changes meet with you approval, please fax 
a signed copy of the agreement to me at fax no. (713) 646-3490 and I will, in 
turn, have it executed by Enron.  If you need to talk to me about the changes 
please call me at (713) 853-3399.  Mark is out of the office today, but will 
return Tuesday.  If you need to talk to him, his direct dial no. is (713) 
345-8897.  
Nora,

I have a call into my business person.  I ran what's going on by Mark Taylor 
(you know, I'm just a paralegal, Mark's a lawyer), and got his permission to 
exclude the arbitration language from the agreement.  So I just wanted to run 
it by Dave, and then we're home free.  Also, I don't know who you had lined 
up to sign, but Louise Kitchen has strict rules that I have to have someone 
from her group execute all their documents.  Who would you get to sign?

Update.  Bridge has signed and faxed back to us the attached NDA.  We have 
not provided a signed counterpart and will not until we hear back from you.  
If the attached is not acceptable to Net Works, we can ask Bridge to sign the 
NDA again with DealBench as the Enron counterparty and you can have Bridge 
sign the appropriate NDA for Net Works.

I apologize for any inconvenience; we merely were trying to accommodate 
everyone's goals in a short time frame.

A couple of additional thoughts.  The mutual NDA covers Net Works and its 
wholly-owned subsidiaries (which includes EOL).  Equitable relief is more 
likely than arbitration to be the relief sought for breach of an NDA and 
equitable relief is covered by attached.  We appreciate the need to conform 
to policy; these thoughts are shared merely in an attempt to help streamline 
the process for this transaction.  Again, just let us know how you would like

Attached are approvals for January 12, 2001.  You'll note that several 
amended counterparties appear; in these cases ONLY THE CELLS HIGHLIGHTED IN 
YELLOW should be changed within the user profile for a given counterparty.  
Hopefully this will save some time both for credit as well as for product 
control.  As in the past, counterparties who are declined are crossed out 
across the profile.  New counterparties are highlighted as necessary.  

Please call if you have any questions; thanks.

Mr. Harrell,

Thanks for the lovely note about the execution rate.  When we had a big group 
meeting a few months ago we (Legal) were actually surprised by our success 
level at that time, but these numbers exceed our expectations.

Since you congratulated Credit, I took it upon myself to also email the 
message to Credit. too..
I am being told that FirstEnergy Services Corp. is the successor by merger to 
First Energy Trading Services Inc.  I do not have any documentation 
reflecting this merger.  Do you?Cheryl,

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for January.  
To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable Macros 
and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.  

Sure,

Just make sure that she has an updated book.  Also, can you verify that my 
book is updated since we use it to make the other copies.  Thanks.

I am being told that FirstEnergy Services Corp. is the successor by merger to 
First Energy Trading Services Inc.  I do not have any documentation 
reflecting this merger.  Do you?





She was on long term leave for about 4 mos. and then has to reapply to get 
another job someone in Enron since her job was filled in our group.  I heard 
she was back in the country, but I haven't heard whether she was going to

		 Subject: Name Change/Merger Notification

Please find attached the Name Change/Merger Notification Report for January.  
To launch the report, double click on the attachment and select Enable Macros 
and Read Only.
Please note that:
 ERMS short names will be changed in GCP and ERMS each Friday at 10am Central 
Time, and 
 Inactivations will be made on Feb 1

We have made a few changes to our Name Change/Merger Notification Report - it 
now has a new look and a couple of features we hope will assist you.  For 
more information, please click below:


Each month now has two sheets, a summary sheet (eg Jan 01 Changes) and a 
detailed sheet (eg Jan 01).
Click below for more information:

The summary sheet can be used to view all changes after a certain date.  If 
you're aware of all changes up to, say, January 15th enter 01/16/2001 in cell 
C6 of the Summary Sheet and click the Sort button in cell H6.  All changes 
made to the report on or after January 16th will be listed automatically.
The Summary sheet may also be sorted for certain criteria - use the drop down 
arrows alongside the column headers to make your selection.

This sheet contains all the information you are used to seeing, but slightly 
reformatted.  Key points are: 
In the case of an Inactivation, the cause of the Inactivation (eg Merger) is 
listed in the Comments section
As with the previous format, 
all months' reports will be sent cumulatively throughout the year
the report will be sent out twice each month, on the 15th and at the end of 
the month.


It is our aim to publish the report in Livelink and to send out only the 
summary sheet and a URL for the detailed report each month.  This will save a 
lot of space in Lotus Notes and we hope it will streamline your monitoring 
process.

We'd be very happy to receive any comments you may have.

Update.  Bridge has signed and faxed back to us the attached NDA.  We have 
not provided a signed counterpart and will not until we hear back from you.  
If the attached is not acceptable to Net Works, we can ask Bridge to sign the 
NDA again with DealBench as the Enron counterparty and you can have Bridge 
sign the appropriate NDA for Net Works.

I apologize for any inconvenience; we merely were trying to accommodate 
everyone's goals in a short time frame.

A couple of additional thoughts.  The mutual NDA covers Net Works and its 
wholly-owned subsidiaries (which includes EOL).  Equitable relief is more 
likely than arbitration to be the relief sought for breach of an NDA and 
equitable relief is covered by attached.  We appreciate the need to conform 
to policy; these thoughts are shared merely in an attempt to help streamline 
the process for this transaction.  Again, just let us know how you would like 
to proceed.  Regards, NJD

Are you drafting this NDA for us?  I have already prepared a draft based off 
your form, which adds not only Enron Net Works, but also EnronOnline as our 
counterparty.  In addition, we have a company policy that requires that we 
have arbitration in all of our agreement.  Our client over at EnronOnline, 
Dave Samuels, is sending our form to his customer.

have asked Rose to initial for Net Works (Mark, hope this is ok; this is same 
agreement used for DealBench with changes noted below).  Bridge did not 
return signed its counterpart of DealBench agreement, asking this morning for 
a mutual NDA which we have accommodated.  Jeff suggested that since we had to 
revise the agreement, we streamline the Net Works effort by making it the 
Enron counterparty (Net Works and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (including 
DealBench) are covered by NDA).

Tana, in light of your instructions that we not work on confirmations until 
"confirm training" is complete, I am asking you to help resolve a problem 
brought to my attention by Mara Alexander at Cargill re: a confirm.  I had 
not worked on the confirm so this is the first time I am hearing about the 
issue.

As per Mara's fax, a copy of which I am forwarding to you, a confirmation was 
sent on Jan. 12th for a trade done on the 11th.  Although there is an ISDA 
pending for Cargill-Alliant, the Confirm that was sent does not, according to 
Mara, reference the pending ISDA.

Please let me know if you can help resolve this.  I have meetings all 
afternoon, so if I am not around, leave me an email.FYI...

1,  1990  and  October 31, 1999  as  of   December  10, 1999  has  reached

This  is  record  territory  due  in  no  small  part  to  teams  working

Tana - this contract was done for purposes of procuring German news onto the 
Enron Strommarkt website (enronstromarkt.de) but we are now in the process of 
'porting' this information onto EnronOnline.  The contract is loosely worded 
and allows us to use the VWD news on any 'single URL ' of our choice. In this 
case, we're switching from Strommarkt to EnronOnline so no new contract is 
required though this does now concern EnronOnline.

The attached agreement is signed by Chris McKey (Enron ) but not VWD.       
(I will  forward you an English translated version too but of course it is 
not signed).

Michael - if you have the agreement signed by VWD please fax it urgently to 
Tana Jones in Houston.   Fax number: 1 713 345 7038.  Please also fax over 
any other executed agreements (with third party's signature) to Tana ASAP - 
I'm not aware of any others , are you?)  Thanks for your help.

Mark,

We finally got the information from Mr Hashimota.

Could you please give me a bilateral NDA by late morning or early 
midafternoon if at all possible?  I realize this is a hurry up and wait 
scenario and I apologize for  giving you such a short timeframe but I am 
working around the client.  

We will be discussing the figures for clickpaper and we will ask them 
information on who they sell too how much etc.

Should you have any questions please feel free to call me at 30559

Thanks.

Jake

Paul,
We are just about to get the long-term agreement with Arthur Andersen 
signed.  I will attach the latest version of this, which we are waiting for 
AA to give final approval and assign .  We do have the short term agreement 
that was signed to provide the audit of the price reports from Nov. 1-30.  I 
believe Tana does have a copy of this contract.  (Tana- I think Claudia Clark 
also has a copy).  Let me know if you would like to see that copy as well.

Thanks.

Tana - we also have an agreement that has either been signed or is about to 
be signed with Arthur Andersen (whereby they provide 'audit' services for our 
EnronOnline Price Reports (aka indices).  Julie Ferrara should have this 
agreement if one of them hasn't already sent it to you.

Julie  - could you also forward me this agreement assuming you have it? Would 
be useful to have it in our other discussions with AA re: SECA Coal index .

Is VWD the only agreement you have currently signed on that side of the

Schuh/FRA/ECT@ECT
		 Subject: Re: Follow Up

VWD is actually NOT an EnronOnline agreement so it's  important everyone 
realizes this. It was signed by Chris McKey , formerly head of Enron 
Frankfurt office and , presumably by VWD.  We are simply going to be using 
the existing agreement (which does not mention EnronOnline whatsoever), since 
it generically allows us to use their news on ANY  single Enron website we 
choose (does not restrict us).  As such is it necessary to have the copy 
signed by VWD ?  I would have thought that the important signature was the 
Enron signature since we are paying them for a service , not vice versa.

All other agreements related to EnronOnline this side of the Atlantic are 
pending (non-executed) to the best of my knowledge. 

 Michael - do you know of any other signed agreements that specifically 
relate to EnronOnline in Germany?  

The only other one that has possibly been signed is an agreement with a 
company called IMP that Nick Mooney arranged for some sort of outsourced 
direct marketing work for EnronOnline (suspect this is very small potatoes 
but will find out).   However, I'd suggest you contact Kal Shah - he may know 
about this agreement if it does in fact exist.

heads up

Effective February 1, 2001, Koch Energy Trading and Entergy Power Marketing 
will be merging.  The new name will be Axia Energy Trading.  I have left a 
voice mail for Karen to call the customer with details of what Enron requires 
to accomplish this change in our systems.  I also conferenced Vikkie Karel 
(Koch Energy  -- 713-544-5269) with Walter for clarification of the parties 
that are merging.

Regarding EOL users from both companies, is there a way that the customer can 
keep IDs/filters/etc. and move to the new name? OR, will new IDs need to be 
created?  ===== this is for you, Stephanie

Griff

Anthony,

I just spoke to the Entergy lawyer, and this merger isn't effective until 
2/1/01.  She will be sending me documents when they are filed with the 
Delaware Secretary of State.  So you don't need to worry about this.

Subject: merging of Koch Energy Trading and Entergy Power Marketing

heads up

Effective February 1, 2001, Koch Energy Trading and Entergy Power Marketing 
will be merging.  The new name will be Axia Energy Trading.  I have left a 
voice mail for Karen to call the customer with details of what Enron requires 
to accomplish this change in our systems.  I also conferenced Vikkie Karel 
(Koch Energy  -- 713-544-5269) with Walter for clarification of the parties 
that are merging.

Regarding EOL users from both companies, is there a way that the customer can 
keep IDs/filters/etc. and move to the new name? OR, will new IDs need to be 
created?  ===== this is for you, Stephanie

Griff



Attached is what I hope is a pretty complete list of the EnronOnline 
contracts I have been made aware of.  There are a few I have open questions 
about  or am waiting to receive copies of the contract.  Can each of you 
please take a look and think about whether there are any others we may be 
missing.  Again, my time frame is short here, so if I can get your response 
promptly I would be most appreciative.



 I just got a call from Stuart Rosman, who is meeting with the referenced 
counterparty right now.  NCPA would like to get a password in place today to 
start trading, and there seems to be some confusion as to what types of 
transactions they can do online.  Per my earlier approval, this counterparty 
can trade any physical products under the credit terms established by 
Credit.  They, however, cannot trade financial until we get an ISDA Master in 
place (and have told Stuart they are currently not interested in trading 
financial).

Stuart said he would be calling Carrie in about 1/2 to make sure this message 
is conveyed to her.

If anyone is aware of any problems here, please convey them to Carrie ASAP!----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 01/19/2001 09:18 AM -----

We may want to rethink allowing P&G to trade on Clickpaper for financial 
business.  We have been trying to negotiate an ISDA with P&G for well over a 
year, to no avail.  While they are a great credit, they have issues with our 
no reliance clause in our documents which is a HUGE legal issue and they were 
involved in a large derivative lawsuit with Bankers Trust several years ago.  
This may be one for legal to decide, but my vote is against until there is an 
ISDA to confirm trades under.

Thanks,
Tanya

Credit has them as being an "ESP", which means they are an Eligible Swap 
Participant under the rules of the CFTC.  The CFTC sets financial criteria, 
such as certain net worth and assets tests for companies to trade financial 
products .  Sometimes counterparties can still meet the legal criteria, but 
Credit may not want to do that type of business with them.

Tana,
Thanks for the approvals.  One question though.  Credit approved American 
Color Graphics for physical transactions only.  However,
your sheet shows them open for financial trading.  Usually, you will close a 
counterparty for financial
if Credit does.

Group-

Earlier this week, we met Tana Jones (Senior Legal Specialist) and Leslie 
Hansen (Legal Counsel) with ENA (servicing ENW) to discuss the process for 
executing NDAs.  Leslie will serve as in-house legal counsel for EMS while 
Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all documentation such as NDAs.

There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is 
bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business 
information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly 
articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is 
the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact 
Tana via email (tana.jones@enron.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the 
following information:
 1.  Which form you would like to use
 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared
 3.  Counterparty's legal name
 4.  Counterparty's address
 5.  Contact name at Counterparty
 6.  How/where to send NDA and appropriate information (fax or email and 
number or address).

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

Notice No. 01-29
January 23, 2001

TO: All NYMEX and COMEX Division Members and Member 
Firms                                        All Clearing Member Firms
       All Compliance Officers and Operations Managers

FROM: Neal Wolkoff; Executive Vice-President

RE: Proposal to Increase Clearing Member Capital Requirement
_________________________________________________________________

The Clearing House Committee has proposed to the Board of Directors ("Board") 
that the capital requirement of a clearing member firm be increased to $5 
million.

However, the Board is giving interested parties an opportunity to apply for 
clearing member privileges while the capital requirement remains at its 
current level of $2 million. Thus, if a firm files with the Exchange a 
clearing member application no later than May 31, 2001, it will not be 
required to meet the new $5 million requirement until one year later, May 31, 
2002. The same effective date would apply to all existing Clearing Members.

Applications for clearing membership can be obtained from the Membership 
Department. If the Exchange does not receive any new clearing member 
applications by May 31, 2001, the proposed capital requirement increase to $5 
million will become effective for all existing clearing member firms on June 
30, 2001.

Should you have any questions regarding these issues please contact Artie 
McCoy, Vice President of Financial Surveillance at 212-299-2928 or Joe 
Sanguedolce, Director, at 212-299-2855.

Tana, PSC is in the process of merging with Western Resources, a Topeka, 
Kan.-based IOU with which we signed a very heavily negotiated ISDA master 
late last year.  When we send the draft of ISDA out, I think we should 
consider sending out  the version signed by Western Resources and tell them 
it is the same document that their soon-to-be sister company already has in 
place with us.

FYI, according to PSC's website, when the merger is complete, PSC and Western 
Resources will both be owned by a newly created holding company.  This may be 
of interest to credit.  -- Bob

At the request of Bob Shults, I am enclosing our proposed form of
Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If you have any comments or questions you would
like to discuss with me, do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.  If
the NDA meets with your approval, please return a copy to me via fax no.
(713) 646-3490.  We look forward to hearing from you.

(See attached file: united fuels.doc)
Attached is a clean and redlined draft of the NDA.


There are two general forms that the online team uses for NDAs.  The first 
form is bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential 
business information.  The second is a unilateral, Enron Protected Party form 
and more thoroughly protects Enron's interests.  The second form should be 
used when Enron is the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please email me 
the following information:

 1.  Which form you would like to use
 2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared
 3.  Counterparty's legal name
 4.  Counterparty's address
 5.  Contact name at Counterparty
 6.  How/where you would like me to send NDA and appropriate information (fax 
or email and number or address).  We believe the password would have been sent to Mark Haedicke.  He will be 
back in the office tomorrow and Janette will try and locate it for us when he 
gets in.

Tana, can you send a loi to GFI with terms identical to the Prebon LOI.  The

Per my conversation with Peter earlier today, below is a list of classes that 
Mark may want to coordinate his Houston secondment with so he can attend 
some. 

Internal Classes:

Basics of Risk Management:  4/26 - 4/27  filling up-act quickly

Derivatives 1:  4/17 - 4/18  filling up-act quickly
                             5/8 - 5/9 - lots of room still here

The internal classes book up quickly.  Everything between now and April is 
already full with large waiting lists.  If he is really interested he should 
try and sign up for classes immediately.  He can do that by going to the 
"Development Center" Icon (aka "Ernie").  Then he can sign up on the computer.

External NYMEX Class:

I checked with the local NYMEX office, and their next classes are as follows:

June 7 - Introduction to NYMEX Products
June 14 - Intermediate Hedging (intro class a prerequisite)
June 17 - Intermediate Options (intro class a prerequisite)

Like the internal classes, the NYMEX classes also fill quickly.  Their 
February classes are already full.

As I also mentioned, the first weekend in April is when the Roundtop Antiques 
Festival is.  It is a great way to see the countryside outside of Houston, 
all the local towns around Roundtop also have antique festivals at that 
time.  The wildflowers should be in bloom, and that is alway impressive.  
With the cold weather and rain, we might have a really good year for 
wildflowers this year.

Anyway, the above may help Mark get the most out of his time in Houston.Don't think so, but I'll check w/the NYMEX and let you know....

I just spoke to Dave Fuller in the Portland Office about a potential 10 year 
deal he wants to do as soon as possible with the referenced entity.  As we 
all know, because of the legal issues that arose out of the "Orange County" 
litigation, no financial trades should be entered into with any governmental 
entity before legal due diligence of the counterparty has been completed and 
an ISDA Master is in place.   Also, besides the usual issues surround the 
governmental's authority to enter into derivative transactions, we also need 
to determine whether this entity can enter into transactions as long as 10 
year w/o prior voter approval.

Credit, if you will send the credit worksheet directly to me I will prepare a 
draft ASAP and Sara will review it.  Dave should be calling you with the 
information.

Christian, if you have done any due diligence already on this counterparty we 
would appreciate any assistance/documents you can provide.

Thank you all for your assistance with this.It is because we are required to due certain corporate due diligence prior to 
trading, which we don't do unless they really want to trade financial.  Most 
of these counterparties are really interested in trading physical products, 
so we don't bother to do the necessary due diligence.  If they really want to 
trade financial, we could transact w/o a master, we'd just have to check 
their corporate documents, file Consents to Service of Process, etc.  If 
we're doing all that we tend to say let's just get the master in place while 
we're at it.

Hi Tana

Many thanks for this, and in due course I'll let you have updates for Europe.

I have a question for Mexico, Argentina and Chile:  Why is their a necessity 
to have Master Agreements in place for commodity derivatives? I would imagine 
this is driven by the Credit Dept and their preference for netting?  I can't 
think why there could be any legal objections - and I have read advice 
obtained by Brent H. for Chile and Mexico and no such restrictions are 
mentioned.

And also in relation to Mexico, could you find out what corporate due 
diligence is required of Mexican companies, in particular of the entity 
mentioned below, Femas Empaques SA de CV.

Many thanks

Francisco,

You should have gotten my email back to Justin.

 We have two sets of online customers coming thru, one set that originates 
from Houston Credit and one set originates from London Credit.  We are 
responsible for responding for Houston Credit based customers, and London 
Legal for London based customers.

A side issue to all of this is how we gather legal advice on trading around 
the world.  We don't want to duplicate efforts and costs by having both 
Houston and London Legal Departments requesting separate advice.  Our office 
is responsible for legal advice in the Americas and Southeast Asia, while 
London leads the efforts in Europe .  After we each receive advice we provide 
copies and communicate to each other the advice received.  Even though we 
both receive the same legal advice, sometimes we don't always agree on the 
approach in a particular country, and at the end of the day, each Legal Dept. 
is responsible for their own clients.

As far as the advice on Mexico, Chile and Argentina, as I told Justin, the 
advice I have received from the Houston lawyers is that although we can 
transact financial products in these countries, we have certain legal risks 
in doing so, and we need to do corporate due diligence to check their 
appropriate corporate documents to see if they are allowed to do these, and 
further, most of these counterparties have not filed consents to service of 
process here in the U.S., which we require in order to trade with us.  Since 
what these counterparties usually want to trade are physical products, we 
don't waste our time doing the due diligence at this point.  If a 
counterparty really wanted to trade financial we would spend the time 
resolving those issues.

As you become the responsible lawyer, first in Mexico, and maybe in the rest 
of South America, you may have a different opinion on these issues and we can 
certainly change our policies at any time.  All of the above is just what my 
current direction is from our lawyers.

Hi Francisco

Just so that I can inform the rest of my team and the marketing people - why 
is it that we require Masters with Mexican counterparties and not with 
counterparties from other countries?  Would it make any difference if the 
Enron Entity was in the UK like Enron Metals Limited rather than US?

Does this apply for offline trading as well?

Dear Tana;

International Corp. (ECTRIC) London.
It is my understanding he would need ENRON ONLINE SYSTEM to do so.

     Is that corrrect?
     If so, do we go directly through Enron Houston to get the system placed

     Do we need to coordinate Enron London IT personnel with BNP

     Can you assist us with as much information as possible?

     We await your response accordingly. Thanks much. Kind regards

Hey Peter,

Due to my wife's pregnancy, I was hoping to schedule my secondment to Houston 
such that I would be back in Calgary no later than the end of April.  In this 
regard, I have managed to enrol in the Basics of Risk Management Course for 
March 29 - 30, 2001 (can be cancelled without charge up to March 26, 2001) 
and the Derivatives 1 Course for April 17 - 18, 2001 (can be cancelled 
without charge up to April 12, 2001).

If possible, I would like to begin the secondment on Monday, March 19, 2001 
and return to Calgary on Friday, April 20, 2001.  Please let me know what you 
think when you get the chance.

Thanks,

Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, who has been hired to assist Apache/Shell with the

Fletcher Challenge would like to assign their petro business to Shell 
Holdings for a short time (like one day or so).  Shell would then immediately 
transfer the agreement/transactions to Apache.  He proposes we get a new 
master in place with Apache, since Apache is a better credit than Fletcher 
Challenge.  He said he will send me some letter showing how he would like to 
do this, along with a draft Apache ISDA (without collateral, of course, since 
Apache is such a good credit).  I told him that I can't speak for Credit, but 
we probably are going to have a big problem on that last point.  We never 
enter into masters without a collateral annex attached.

It's pretty darn old and pretty ugly.

1.  It's a Local Currency Form, so we cannot transact cross border/cross 
currency products under it.
2.  We have a 3rd Party Cross Default to Enron Corp. of $25,000,000
3.  We've got market quotation for terminations
4.  No arbitration language
5.  Hard to believe, but we've made no choice of law election
6.  Don't have trade option rep (which probably doesn't matter anymore)
7.  ISDA Defintions refer to 1987 Interest Rate & Currency Exchange Agreement
8.  Setoff language old and doesn't have affiliate language in it
9.  Market Disruption Events not standard
10.  Old "ERMS" Collateral Annex
11.  $10,000,000 Exposure Threshold
12.  Credit Event Upon Merger triggers -0- threshold
13.  LC Only Annex - really old LC language/forms everywhere

This is basically a REALLY old, it looks like heavily negotiated, form.  This 
might be a good time to replace it.  I don't know how much trading we do with 
Apache.

Don't know about the Shell intermediary part.  I hope that will be spelled 
out in his email.  Also, we have about a 5 year old Local Currency ISDA in 
Place with them, so we could put the trades under that master.  I don't know 
if we want to upgrade the master at this time, or just stay where we are.  He 
said we didn't have a master w/Apache, but when entered my notes into lotus 
notes I noticed we did.  I called him back, he didn't know ERMS was the same 
as ENA.

Apache is investment grade, but they are not bank quality.  In actuality, I 
think they are about the same quality as Fletcher, regardless of Saul's 
comments.  What is the purpose of the Shell for a day transaction?

Subject: Fletcher Challenge/Apache Assignment

Per a conversation I just had with Saul Laureles, an attorney with 
Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, who has been hired to assist Apache/Shell with the 
assignment of the Fletcher Challenge business.  He said:

Fletcher Challenge would like to assign their petro business to Shell 
Holdings for a short time (like one day or so).  Shell would then immediately 
transfer the agreement/transactions to Apache.  He proposes we get a new 
master in place with Apache, since Apache is a better credit than Fletcher 
Challenge.  He said he will send me some letter showing how he would like to 
do this, along with a draft Apache ISDA (without collateral, of course, since 
Apache is such a good credit).  I told him that I can't speak for Credit, but 
we probably are going to have a big problem on that last point.  We never 
enter into masters without a collateral annex attached.  

I'll keep you posted when I hear from him.

On your excel spreadsheet for clickpaper, can you add the physical products 
to the legal tab so I don't have to copy those over each time.  Thanks.Here is a rough first draft of our jurisdictional database (summary of swap 
laws).  Besides the obvious typos, how does this work for you?

Dave,

Attached is the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  The document you 
faxed me was the preprinted form of ISDA Master Agreement.  That document, 
TOGETHER with the attached Schedule is your full "ISDA Master Agreement".  
Also attached to this Schedule is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and 
proposed form of Legal Opinion to be issued by Clark County PUD #1.

It is my understanding that you will provide these documents directly to the 
counterparty.  Again, the whole package above must be provided to the 
counterparty or you will not have a complete set of documents.  Call me if 
you have any questions.


At the request of Jake Staffel, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Non-Disclosure Agreement.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please 
sign the NDA and return it to me via fax (713) 646-3490.  If you have any 
comments or questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.

The Finance Group is trying to locate some really old "Master Agreements" 
done in 1995.  We looked around and we didn't have any masters in place for 
the counterparties, but I was thinking maybe they really weren't "Master 
Agreements" but our old style confirmations.  The two counterparties were 
State Street Bank, as Trustee for Cash I, and Citibank as Agent, for Cash I.  
The Agreements were listed in the closing documents as "Interest Rate 
Agreement" and "Commodity Swap Agreement".  Can you look around and see if 
you have some really old active trades out there for either of those 
counterparties...?

So not to confuse you, about 2 or so years ago, we did some deals for State 
Street for the Cash VI Project.  The master for Cash VI is  actually is 
listed in the Financial Trading Database.

Thanks for your help!Taffy,

Lisa,

I have a call into the physical steel lawyer.  We will not be able to copy =
an=20
existing profile for physical steel.  Physical steel is a totally new onlin=
e=20
product for us.  We, obviously, cannot copy financial steel, because=20
counterparties may be prohibited from trading it if they are not ESP's, if=
=20
their master doesn't let them trade steel, etc (the usual swap issues).  Wh=
at=20
I think my answer is going to be is that there is no legal reason why any=
=20
counterparty cannot trade physical steel, so I would open all counterpartie=
s=20
up to trade it.  I'm checking with the physical steel lawyers to confirm th=
is.

Just a note, Global Contracts should also not be able to copy a profile,=20
because they should have a totally new GTC dealing with physical steel issu=
es=20
specifically.  I'm sure Karen will probably copy me in on her email.  Just =
in=20
case...I want to confirm what Global Contracts is saying for this one...

I'll get back to you to confirm the above for Legal.

Tana, thanks for the help you extended Karen Cordova, Marianne Castano and me 
on our recent ISDA quest.

We received a copy of a letter telling us we should contact the Primary ISDA 
contact within our firm for the Firm ID and Password assigned to our 
organization.  Marianne Castano asked that I get it from you or find out who 
I should call.

Thanks for your help.

on NYMEX ACCESS


Notice No. 01-42
January 31, 2001

MEMORANDUM

TO:  ALL NYMEX AND COMEX MEMBERS

FROM:  Neal L. Wolkoff , Executive Vice President

DATE:  January 31, 2001

RE:  Six-Month Extension of Resolution Governing Price Fluctuation Limits   
Applicable to Trading on NYMEX ACCESS

On December 12, 2000, the Exchange issued Notice to Members #421, which 
consisted of a reminder to Members of an Exchange Resolution in effect that 
concerned Exchange price fluctuation limit rules as those rules apply to 
trading on NYMEX ACCESS(; That notice stated that the Resolution would 
continue until February 1, 2001, unless Members were notified otherwise by 
the Exchange.

The purpose of this Notice is to advise Members that the Exchange has 
extended this Resolution, which is attached below, for another six months.  
Thus, this Resolution will continue through August 1, 2001, unless Members 
are notified otherwise by the Exchange.

If you have any questions, please contact Rick Taibi, Director, NYMEX ACCESS 
Operations, NYMEX ACCESS Department, at (212) 299-2677; or Brian Regan, 
Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.

* * * *

APPROVED RESOLUTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEEOF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
REGARDING PRICE FLUCTUATION LIMITS FOR EXCHANGE CONTRACTS

The Executive Committee of the Board of Directors hereby

Resolves that, until further notice, the price fluctuation limit rules for 
each futures contract that is listed for trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r) and that 
has such applicable rules shall continue in effect except as amended below 
with regard to market activity occurring on NYMEX ACCESS(r):

The initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits (for each Exchange 
futures contract that has such limits) shall be expanded to 200% of the 
initial and subsequent price fluctuation limits applicable to the first two 
contract months of that futures contract that have price limits under the 
applicable rule.

This expanded limit (200% of the limits for the first two months with limits) 
shall be applicable to all contract months for that futures contract.

In the event that such a price fluctuation limit is reached by a bona fide 
bid at the high price fluctuation limit or a bona fide offer at the low price 
fluctuation limit, trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r) shall be halted immediately 
except as directed otherwise by the President or the President's designee.  
Following resumption of trading, the price limits in effect shall be 200% of 
the limits applicable to RTH trading.  In the event that a limit is touched 
during the last 90 minutes of a NYMEX ACCESS(r) session, the market shall be 
halted briefly, and price limits shall be expanded thereafter

In addition, in the event that a contract trading on NYMEX ACCESS(r) traded 
for five minutes during the NYMEX ACCESS&#61495; session at a price 
fluctuation limit applicable to the Regular Trading Hours session, then the 
RTH session shall open with expanded price fluctuation limits as provided 
under the applicable rule, even though no temporary cessation of trading 
occurred during the NYMEX ACCESS(r) trading session.

Hi Tana,

This email is in response to my earlier voice mail regarding two NDAs to be 
sent out today.  Here's what I think may be the pertinent information:

Continental Airlines - Cargo
1600 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002
United States 
Attn:  Mr. Ed O'Meara


Eagle Global Logistics
15350 Vickery Dr
Houston, TX 77032
Attn:  Mr. Stephen J. Carattini

Content might say something about not mentioning any details about talking to 
Enron about air cargo commoditization with any other company or to the press, 
etc. until we give them express written permission.  

I'm sure I forgot something relevant.  Just give me a call at 5-9323.

Tana,

Thanks for your help.  We will hold off on sending one to Continental at this 
time.  Please have a lawyer initial the EGL NDA with the following changes:
? Their legal name is EGL, Inc.
? Remove EnronOnline
? Replace EnronOnline with more ambiguous terminology, should we choose to 
put the product on "a different platform or product or service offered by 
ENW."

I'd like to get this signed and sent out today.

Thanks,

Fred

Attached is the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  The document you 
faxed me was the preprinted form of ISDA Master Agreement.  That document, 
TOGETHER with the attached Schedule is your full "ISDA Master Agreement".  
Also attached to this Schedule is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and

It is my understanding that you will provide these documents directly to the

you have any questions.

>WALKING:
>As often as possible, dart quickly and as close as

Ms. Jones,

I know you are working hard, but I needed to just check in and see how you
are.

Also, I just talked to Gale Ford, massage lady, and she said she will be
working on Sat., March 3 in the afternoon.  I know weekdays are hard for you
to make appointments and surely you are in need of a massage by now!!!!

Let me know how you are when you come up for air!!

Are we currently doing any trading out of BT, or are we doing it all under 
Deutsche Bank now?Yes, Lucinda had a little girl last Friday by c-section.  She  was about 5 
lbs 12 oz (3 weeks early).  Her name is Sophia Eleni.  Then my brother 
Craig's wife had her baby on 1/9/01, a little boy name Daniel Francisco.  He 
was 7 lbs, 12 oz.  Then one of the attys I work with had a baby, a little 
boy, she lives around the block from me on Vassar, so a few of us went over 
to visit her.  We had to cancel Lucinda's baby shower the night before it 
because the baby was early.

I'm a little afraid to go see Hannibal, maybe something a little cheerier...?

like it could be in a kitty calendar.  The photos of Daniel were really good, 
especially that close up.  He really is a handsome baby.  I am going to have 
to get one of those cameras so I can send Chris photos to post of the

Per our conversation, can you get Bill added as a VP of Enron North America.  
He didn't want to fuss Enron Canada or EPMI right now.  Thanks for your help!Correct.  The Services Agreement in place between ENA & ECC is what allows us 
to transact between the two companies without adverse tax consequences.  We 
have no such agreement in place with ECTRIC, and the UK tax regime is 
different.  We cannot transact between ENA & ECTRIC under each others masters.

Can you tell me if we have an NDA with EnergyClear Operating Company LLC.

Thanks.

(Tana - This is an NDA for CommodityLogic - a group within Net Works - Do you 
still track these for Net Works?  Let me know and I will forward a copy of 
the form they submitted.)

E-Mail:      Mark.Greenberg@enron.com
We have received a letter dated 2/6/01from Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, counsel to 
Fletcher Challenge, with respect to the acquisition of Fletcher Challenge by 
Shell Overseas Holdings Limited, and Shell's proposed subsequent assignment 
of the Fletcher Challenge Canadian nat gas trades to Apache Corporation.  I 
am sending copies of this letter to Russell Diamond, Mary Cook, Greg Johnston 
& Joe Hunter.

 Russell, I need to know if we would agree to the assignment of the trades to 
Apache. 

Russell, Mary:   With respect to such assignment, we have an old ERMS ISDA 
Local Currency Master Agreement in place.  Do we want to continue to transact 
w/Apache under this master, or use this as leverage to get a revised ISDA 
master in place?  Among the issues I quickly spotted in the Apache master 
were:

1.  It's a Local Currency Form, so we cannot transact cross border/cross 
currency products under it
2.  We have a 3rd Party Cross Default to Enron Corp. of $25,000,000
3.  We've got market quotation instead of loss for terminations
4.  No arbitration language
5.  Hard to believe, but we've made no choice of law election (maybe I'm 
blind)
6.  Don't have trade option rep (which probably doesn't matter anymore)
7.  ISDA Defintions refer to 1987 Interest Rate & Currency Exchange 
Agreement-time to update
8.  Setoff language old and doesn't have affiliate language in it
9.  Market Disruption Events not standard
10.  Old "ERMS" Collateral Annex
11.  $10,000,000 Exposure Threshold-is this sufficient all this business?
12.  Credit Event Upon Merger triggers -0- threshold
13.  LC Only Annex - really old LC language/forms everywhere

Joe Hunter, I am going to send you down the letter which has what they 
believe to be all the Fletcher Challenge trades listed.  Do we agree?

As usual, they would appreciate a prompt response so they can get this 
assignment completed.  Thanks you all for your help!The financial agreement is with Petro-Canada.  We don't appear to have 
received any notice to the contrary.Just a reminder that I'm going to be in a little late tomorrow.  I'm going 
over to the old TCB Bank bldg. at 9:00am to sign my loan papers.We have received the following executed documents from Counterparty:

1.  Amendment to EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement dated 1/9/01,

		 Subject: Re: Nexen Energy - Credit Worksheet

Our outside counsel has confirmed that the Partnership is a General 
Partnership under Alberta law under the name Nexen Marketing (f/k/a CXY 
Energy Marketing), and the GPs are Nexen Inc., Wascana Energy Inc. and Nexen 
Holdings Canada Ltd.  The GPs would each be jointly and severally liable for 
the Partnership as I outlined previously.

I will fax Ed and Mary a copy of the Partnership search when I receive it..

My assistant will forward the message I received from outside counsel.

Our outside counsel tells me that there is no record at Corporate Registry of 
Nexen Energy Limited Parnership.  I think you need to confirm the entity and 
the org. chart.

Also, the ISDAs are kept in Houston, as legal Houston is responsible to 
prepare.  Nonetheless, we generally keep copies, but do not seem to have an a 
copy of an ISDA with CXY Energy Marketing, CanadianOcccidental or Nexen 
Energy in the Calgary office, so I cannot confirm if it makes any reference 
chnage of control MACs, etc.

Diamond/HOU/ECT@ECT 
Subject: Re: Nexen Energy - Credit Worksheet  

Just a few points, which I explained to Ed yesterday:

1.  If Nexen Energy is a Limited Partnership formed under Alberta law, and 
Nexen Inc. is the General Partner, Nexen Inc. is jointly and severally liable 
for all obligations of the Partnership until it ceases to be the GP.

2.  Upon Nexen Inc. ceasing to be the GP, it will remain jointly and 
severally liable for all unfulfilled obligations of the Partnership incurred 
to us up to the time it ceases as GP unless we otherwise agree.

3.  The result is therefore equivalent in substance (if not in detail) to a 
Guarantee from Nexen Inc.  The only difference is that if a Guarantee is 
terminated, we have written notice of termination to act upon, whereas Credit 
may have to monitor the structure of the Partnership to ensure that Nexen 
Inc. remains as GP.

4.  This is structure which we have been willing to transact on in the past 
in numerous other cases, subject to the following:

(a)  a specific MAC event for Nexen Inc. ceasing to be the GP; and
(b)  a specific continuing rep. of the Partnership (breach of which would 
result in and E of D) that it is a Limited Partnership formed under the laws 
of Alberta, and that its GP is Nexen Inc.

5.  If Ed wanted more comfort, I suggested that we could add Nexen Inc. as a 
party to acknowledge that the Partnership is a Limited Partnership formed 
under the laws of Alberta and that it is the GP, and to covenant that it will 
provide written notice in the event that it ceases to be the GP.

6.  In terms of what is the actual structure, although I believe credit 
typically resolves these issues, the contractual matters referred to above 
should go along way to address Ed's concerns.  I also suggested to Ed that he 
do a preliminary search of the Nexen Inc. web page to get an org. chart and 
information, and then to follow-up with Nexen Inc. to get a copy of the Proof 
of Filing of the Certificate of Limited Partnership issued by Alberta 
Corporate Registry for Nexen Energy, which should indicate Nexen Inc. as the 
GP.  In any event I have asked outside counsel to obtain a copy of the the 
Proof of Filing, which I will circulate upon receipt.. 

I trust the foregoing is helpful.

Subject: Nexen Energy - Credit Worksheet

As per the attached credit worksheet, please amend the ISDA dated 11/17/98 
between ENA and Nexen Energy (formerly CXY Energy Marketing).  This will need 
to be placed on a priority list as Andre is intending on transacting in a 
short time frame.  In addition, I believe that it would be prudent to get 
some form of confirmation regarding the corporate structure (general 
partnership).  We have historically been operating under the assumption that 
Nexen Inc. is general partner and I have underwritten the credit based on the 
financial health of Nexen Inc.  Unlike a formal guaranty agreement whereby we 
would receive notice if the guaranty were to be revoked, this structure is 
difficult to monitor as there is no obligation to notify Enron of ownership 
changes and new transactions may be entered into without the support of Nexen 
Inc to the extent a change in the structure has occurred.  Please reply with 
comments or questions.

I just got off the phone with Margaret Lester, a contract administrator at 
Dynegy, and Harlan Murphy, an attorney she works with.  There was some 
misinformation communicated to them about EOL, and I told them the only way 
we would trade online with them was under the existing master, not under the 
online GTCs, we wanted the bankruptcy protection the master affords.  They 
want to replace the old ERMS Master with an ISDA and I told them we would be 
happy to generate the master.  Can I get some credit from you so I can turn 
around a master quickly, or we will have to work off their form, which will 
then become an ISDA comparison which will be a lot more work in the long run.

Much thanks as usual for your prompt help!Peter,

Dave,

Attached is the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  The document you 
faxed me was the preprinted form of ISDA Master Agreement.  That document, 
TOGETHER with the attached Schedule is your full "ISDA Master Agreement".  
Also attached to this Schedule is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and 
proposed form of Legal Opinion to be issued by Clark County PUD #1.

It is my understanding that you will provide these documents directly to the 
counterparty.  Again, the whole package above must be provided to the 
counterparty or you will not have a complete set of documents.  Call me if 
you have any questions.

Julie,

Just an FYI.

Depending on the type of contract, when I get them in I check them to make 
sure they have been correctly executed, and then, for the most part, I send 
the originals to Dave Samuels, who I have designated as the original file 
keeper for the non-trading related online documents.  I keep copies of the

I am also working to put a database together so we can monitor what contract

Jason, our new computer floortech, has discovered why we can't get into the 
system.  He spoke to the Tradespark people and Tradespark is an NT system, 
and they won't have Microsoft 2000 compatibility for several months.  We 
cannot install NT on each of your individual computers, Jason says you can 
only have one system at any given time, so I have asked him to locate an 
unused terminal on the floor and install NT on that computer.  As soon as we 
have it up and running, I will let you know and you will have to do your 
review at that terminal.

Thanks for your patience.What is the nature of your project or discussions?  Will our standard

Yes, I compared their blackline below against the draft I originally sent 
out, and the only changes were to the counterparty name, "or its affiliates" 
language, and NY from Texas, the same changes showing in the blackline below.

Mark,

I have reviewed your standard form NDA and have noted two minor comments
thereon.  I have suggested the State of New York as a more neutral
jurisdiction and one that is widely used in commerical transactions, rather
than the State of Texas.  The other comments are self explanatory.

Please contact me should you have any concerns.

Tana,

Tara and I are auditing the EOL bridge and noticed that the Phillip Allen / 
Reliant Energy deal from 11/28/00 is still unresolved.  Can you tell me what 
ever came about of that.  This is the transaction where Phillip mistakenly 
put the incorrect product on the web, Reliant hit on it, and then Phillip got 
out of the deal by talking to Reliant over the phone.  

Please update me on what happened.  I know it happened awhile ago......

Group as possible.  Are you the one in the group that keeps up with any 
changes made to yours and do you also spearhead getting Clement's blessing?  
We noticed a couple differences in the one attached below from ours and was 
wondering when this form was last changed and any reasoning on why it was 
changed.  Also, how can I be notified when there is a change to your form?  I 
would be glad to copy you also on any changes we make to our form.  Please 
advise if you are not the right contact and if you are, let's discuss.

Just to be sure we are working with the "latest form" of Enron guaranty, 
could you get from Tana the most current swap one and the check it agaianst 
the one we use for EEI - I would think they should be the same;  if not, lets

You'll see that I asked our group to keep you updated on the guaranty form.

Greg Malcolm, the Contract Administrator for OPG just called to give me the

1. EEI (physical power): Said I could expect to receive their comments to our 
initial draft no later than the end of Feb.

2. ISDA (financial): I should receive a response from them on our initial 
draft sometime in March (he was not as firm on this timeframe as he was about 
the EEI). 

3. Physical Power Confirms:  For interim trading, he is going to send me the 
form of confirmation template they want to use for sales to us. 


Commercial People: If these timeframes are unacceptable given whatever 
business you are trying to do with OPG - please ask your equivalent at OPG to 
put pressure on OPG's Legal Dept. There is nothing I can do to make this go 
any faster.

As a follow-up to my email regarding the execution of the 12/29/00 ISDA 
Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Corp., 
please be further advised:

Effective 6/4/99, Bankers Trust Company was acquired by Deutsche Bank AG.  
All financial trading should now be transacted under the above Deutsche Bank 
ISDA Master Agreement.  No further financial trading should be done in the 
name of Bankers Trust Company, and the 4/16/91 ISDA Interest Rate and 
Currency Exchange Agreement with Bankers Trust Company should be inactivated.

All outstanding Bankers Trust Company financial trades were assigned to 
Deutsche Bank AG in the ISDA Master Agreement, and all the Bankers Trust 
Company trades should be moved to Deutsche Bank.As a followup:  This guys name is Mykhaylo Koshel and he is an outside 
consultant with the New Concept Group.  I've got a messenger going over to 
Allen Center to pick up a copy of the agreement with them.  I'll get a copy 
to you as soon as I get it.

 I will revise the Memorandum to conform to Jay's changes.  Jay

Subject: F/U re European power trading by U.S. counterparties

I have spoken with Edmund Cooper to follow up regarding access to European 
power products by U.S. counterparties.  Edmund and Justin Boyd have discussed 
the issue and determined that they would like to follow an approach similar 
to our approach for U.S. power products.  U.S. counterparties should be 
granted read-only access to European power products.  If a specific U.S. 
counterparty wants to trade European power products, the request for access 
can be examined on a case-by-case basis.

Jay,

To reconfirm my conversation yesterday with Reid Grossman, a consultant hired 
by the referenced counterparty to negotiate their trading documents with us:

1.  PUD #1 would also like to get gas and power trading agreements in place 
with us.  Per my conversation with Dave Fuller yesterday, the physical 
trading agreements are of a higher priority than the financial trading 
agreement.
2.  They would like to get a draft of a collateral annex from us.  Their 
suggested trading threshold for themselves was in the $3.5-5mm range.
3.  They would already be in default of the MAC's you sent me in the credit 
worksheet dated 1/25/01.  We need to revisit the MACs.
4.  They think a 3rd party debt threshold of $1mm is too low for them, they 
suggested a threshold of $10mm.
5.  The agreement provides for annual and quarterly financial statements.  I 
don't think they have quarterly.  You need talk to them about what they 
can/will provide.

If you would like to talk to Reid directly, his ph no. is 509/252-5096.

By the way, Reid is an old buddy of Bill Bradford from Reid's Avista/PG&E 
days, and Reid sends his regards to Bill.  If you see Bill pass this message 
on...It is not clear to me how we should handle this, what do you sugguest?  As a 
note, I will be out of the office on Friday.

Tana,
I guess we need to change the Enron legal entity from Enron Corp?
In our current model the transacting entity will be Enron North America 
(which is a Delaware corporation?)
Can you then arrange a suitable signature (Haedicke?)
Can we get this done by the end of Friday?

Attached please find the referenced counterparty approval lists.  Per my 
conv. w/Frank and Leslie Hansen's emails, on a going forward basis, U.S. 
based counterparties should not be approved for European based physical power 
products, and vice versa.  I don't know how you want to handle that, I have 
not "Xed" out European physical power from the attached list.  What should we 
do on a going forward basis?


We have received the fully executed Non-Disclosure Agreement with the 
referenced counterparty.  Copies will be distributed.Things may come in a little differently because of Profile Manager (my direct 
input into the EOL System).  I will now only see amendments to counterparties 
that have already been approved, thru Profile Manager, they will not be 
coming in thru the spreadsheets any more.  So, on amendments that affect 
power, I am going to have to send you an email about the change.

For the above counterparty, we originally had them open for power sales 
only.  Now, Credit is coming back thru wanting to open them up for the bid 
and the offer.  Do you want to change the earlier approval from power sales 
only, or open them up all the way?Attached is an email I got from the lawyer for Fletcher Challenge.  
Obviously, he is on a short time frame, so we need to respond rather 
quickly.  Russell, we need some direction from Credit on how we want to 
proceed on this assignment.  Do you want to meet to go over this, and maybe 
give Bert a call, or what...?  Please let us know.

Tana:

This email is just a follow-up on the telephone message that I left for you 
earlier today.  As I explained, our firm (Chamberlain Hrdlicka) represents 
Apache Corporation and I will be replacing Saul Laureles in concluding our 
work related to the assignment of certain natural gas price swaps from 
Fletcher Challenge Industries Limited ("Fletcher Challenge") to Shell 
Overseas Holdings Limited ("Shell"), and the reassignment from Shell to 
Apache Corporation. My contact information is as follows:

Telephone:  713-654-9693
FAX:   713-658-2553
rviguet@chamberlainlaw.com

You should have received a letter from Saul Laureles dated February 6, 2001 
via overnight courier requesting that your firm confirm certain facts related 
to the swaps to be assigned as described above.  We are looking for a written 
response to that inquiry at your earliest opportunity.  If there are any 
errors or other discrepancies in the list of swap transactions or other 
matters identified in the letter, we need to know as soon as possible so that 
there will be time to resolve those issues before the assignments are made.

This firm (Chamberlain Hrdlicka) has prepared a draft of the Assignment and 
Assumption Agreements for the transfer of the swaps from Fletcher Challenge 
to Shell and from Shell to Apache Corporation. Our draft of the assignment 
forms is being reviewed by attorneys for Shell now, but should be available 
for your review in a few days. The acquisition of assets of Fletcher 
Challenge Energy by Shell and Apache, and the related assignments of the swap 
transactions, is expected to closes in early March.

If you have any questions or comments concerning the proposed transactions, 
please don't hesitate to contact me.  I look forward to working with you.

At the request of Rahil Jafry, I am attaching a copy of our proposed First 
Amendent to License Agreement, which extends the term from February 28, 2001 
to April 30, 2001.  If the Amendment meets with your approval, please execute 
it and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  If you have any questions

For Consolidated Edison Energy, Inc., coming thru by Credit to open them for 
US east power, you already had them open to trade all power under the GTC, so 
I am going to keep them at that.

I'm not so sure I agree with your name change for US Department of the 
Interior.  I think as part of the name we've got to have that it's a govt 
agency.  Anything else would be misleading to what it actually is.  I think 
more appropriate would be United States Department of the Interior, Minerals 
Management Service.

What is the nature of the confidential information being discussed?  Will our 
standard language "...furnished in connection with a possible transaction or 
other business relationship..." suffice, or do you want to be more specific?  
Also, do you want the bilateral form?

Russell,

On Public Service Company of Colorado,  I don't know why you have this on "no 
financial trades", but if it was because of the contract authority problem, 
that has been resolved, so you could open it up if that is the reason.  See 
Lotus Notes for more detail.OK by me, have fun!

Per the directions of Sam Schott, I am forwarding this email on to you.  I 
discussed the counterparty name "Minerals Management Service" with my boss, 
Mark Taylor, General Counsel of ENA, and he agreed that agencies and 
departments of the US government should have the correct governmental 
agency/department as part of the counterparty name.  You could say "Minerals 
Management Service" is a dba for the US Department of the Interior.  We 
generally do not like to contract with dbas, we want the legal entity as part 
of the name.  A more appropriate name for this counterparty is "US Department 
of the Interior Minerals Management Service".  The way the exposure rolls up 
under the GCP System is an exposure issue, not a contract issue.  If you 
disagree with this assessment, please call Mark Taylor at x37459.

Hi Tana,

I tend to agree with you, however, that's the verified name in the GCP 
System. Exposure roll-up should be fine, being that it's Ultimate Parent is 
the Government of the United States. If you have proof of a CP Name 
discrepancy, it should be directed to Global SAP (Cheryl Johnson, x3-3101).

Have a Great Day Tana !!

I just tried to call you, I couldn't get through.  What are you discussing 
with Carr?  Is this just for them to enter into an BETA, or something else?  
Also, do you want a bilateral agreement?  Who will be providing the 
confidential information?  It shouldn't take me too long to draft you and NDA 
once I get this info.  I'll email it to the counterparty and copy you in on 
the email.  Of course, we have to get it signed here in Houston, so time is

Sorry for the long winded voice mail.  I have a meeting with Mark Thomas, 
Head of Energy with Carr Futures, Inc. in London this Tuesday the 27th of 
February.  Carr is a divisions of Credit Agricole Indosuez.  Their 
information is as follows:

I would like to execute a non disclosure agreement prior to our meeting.  If 
possible, please email Mark Thomas our non disclosure agreement as soon as 
you can.

Thanks,

Per Wayne Gresham, a lawyer in the coal group, we are having a substantial 
payment dispute with the referenced counterparty, and George McClellan, the 
business person (and a Managing Director), would like to shut them down 
immediately for all trading (which appears to be coal and emissions), offline 
and online, until this payment dispute is resolved.  At the request of Dan Diamond, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Non-Disclosure Agreement.   If the enclosed meets with your approval, please 
execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will 
then have it executed by an officer of EnronOnline.  If you have any comments 
or questions please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399, or Mark

We are going to be discussing a potential joint business venture around a

the originators in Rex Shelby's group would suffice.  Also, the bilateral 
form is best as they will be sharing information about the industry and their 
companies experience in the industry.

With respect to Western Area Power Administration - CRSP.  Can't "ditto" 
Credit on that one, Credit gives no direction as to what they want to trade.  
The database reflects that Leslie approved them to trade power already in 
July of last year, so my intention is to keep them open.  I don't know what 
"CRSP" means at the end of their name, do you?

Pls see below - I did answer you specifically about WAPA. I am OK to open 
them for trading in the West.

I don't know what CRSP means - maybe Credit does...

With respect to Western Area Power Administration - CRSP.  Can't "ditto" 
Credit on that one, Credit gives no direction as to what they want to trade.  
The database reflects that Leslie approved them to trade power already in 
July of last year, so my intention is to keep them open.  I don't know what 
"CRSP" means at the end of their name, do you?

Sorry about the missing information!!!
I just spoke to Credit about one counterparty on the list.  You've got Utah 
Municipal Power Agency shut down to trade since they're not FERC authorized.  
They specifically came through online wanting to trade power, and Credit 
wants to know if you can give them a call and determine if you can get 
whatever evidence you need to get them open for power.  The name of the guy 
that sent the application in is Richard Judd and his ph no. is (801) 
852-6842.  Thanks!

Subject: Re: F/U re European power trading by U.S. counterparties  

This is contrary to the mandate of EnronOnline, which is to make global 
products trading available to our customers.

If there is a specific reason for shutting down a company, then we must do so 
- but we cannot restrict companies from trading products simply because we 
don't think they want to.

How about this as an alternative:

1) Define the rules which are applied to restrict companies for trading (e.g. 
Must have a Power license to trade Power)
2) Distribute the appropriate rules and company lists between the NA primary 
legal contact and UK primary legal contact (for profile purposes)
3) Each legal group (NA and UK) apply each others rules to the companies 
which they are reviewing
4) Each legal group copies the other with the final company profile which 
they are sending to Frank Davis.


In this way, profiles should be correct as they leave each legal group, but 
each group has the opportunity to scan the work of the other. If there are 
any problems, then the customer profiles can be corrected - if necessary 
after the fact.

This exposes us to (in my opinion) a very small risk that:
 1) The rules for one group are not correctly applied by the other or there 
are extenuating circumstances for a particular party and
 2) The error is not caught before the customer transacts (bear in mind that 
after legal completes their review, there is still a great deal of time 
before the customer can transact, on account of: profile completion process, 
mailing time, customer delay before trading)

Subject: F/U re European power trading by U.S. counterparties

I have spoken with Edmund Cooper to follow up regarding access to European 
power products by U.S. counterparties.  Edmund and Justin Boyd have discussed 
the issue and determined that they would like to follow an approach similar 
to our approach for U.S. power products.  U.S. counterparties should be 
granted read-only access to European power products.  If a specific U.S. 
counterparty wants to trade European power products, the request for access 
can be examined on a case-by-case basis.

As a general matter, you need to use the forms of Confidentiality Agreements 
contained in the atty.fms bank, not the Swap Group's forms.  We have 
developed a few of our own forms for special purposes, one, which is in the 
swap forms database/current forms, protects the counterparty only, and is 
used when Credit wants to get copies of financal statements from a 
counterparty and protects the financial information being provided by the 
counterparty.

I have developed forms for use by the EnronOnline team, but those should not 
be used for any Enron company except EnronOnline and Enron Net Works.

For any other types of matters/projects, we would also use the forms 
contained in the atty.fms bank.

Regretfully, I will no longer be able to submit Application Access Requests 
for you.  Until now, I have submitted e-requests on your behalf, and I feel 
that removing myself from this process will help to reduce turn-around times 
on your requests, as they will no longer have to come through me.  Below, I 
have included detailed instructions on how to submit an e-request for the 
Financial Trading Agreements Database.  Going forward, I would be glad to 
assist you if you have any questions (on the system and on submitting 
e-requests).  

Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

Regards,
Mike 3-3363

e-request Instructions:

1. from your web browser: pull up http://itcentral.enron.com <--or click this 
link
2. click on the "e-request" logo/link
3. select "Corp Logon", you'll then be prompted for your corp login (the same 
one you login with in the morning)
4. then select "Add/Remove access..." under "Update Account Access"
5. chose the user/requestee from the available list of users (and choose 
appropriate priority)
6. next, click the  "Applications" button (the one with gears on it)
7. then click "show all"
8. from this list, scroll down to "Lotus Notes Application - Unlisted" and 
click the "+add" button
9. In the box provided, list "Financial Trading Agreements" and also include 
the group name - in this case "ECT Legal - Swap - Users"

If you like, I can get you database access that will allow you to review the 
comments between Legal & Credit.  We do not give this level of access to 
non-Legal & Credit people because we are trying to limit certain information 
for client-attorney privilege (not to mention the business people give away 
our negotiating positions!).  If you would like this level of access, let me 
know and I will put in a request.  This level of access will also give you 
edit capability, so you need to be careful not to change things by mistake.

I will be having about 5-7 other people that I will need added to this 
database.  Should I send these requests back directly to you, or do them 
through the system as well?

Also, there are two ways of getting edit access through this database.  One 
is for employees of Legal, who can then enter Legal comments, and the other 
is for employees of Credit, who can then enter Credit comments.  Do you see 
that choice?  Is there some way for me to verify which employees of Legal and 
which employees of Credit have what access?  I know that some employees of 
Credit have Legal access by mistake.  Can I get lists of the Legal and Credit 
breakdowns?

As a follow-up to my email regarding the execution of the 12/29/00 ISDA 
Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Corp., 
please be further advised:

Effective 6/4/99, Bankers Trust Company was acquired by Deutsche Bank AG.  
All financial trading should now be transacted under the above Deutsche Bank 
ISDA Master Agreement.  No further financial trading should be done in the 
name of Bankers Trust Company, and the 4/16/91 ISDA Interest Rate and 
Currency Exchange Agreement with Bankers Trust Company should be inactivated.

All outstanding Bankers Trust Company financial trades were assigned to 
Deutsche Bank AG in the ISDA Master Agreement, and all the Bankers Trust 
Company trades should be moved to Deutsche Bank.








You should have edit access now.  Why don't you go try and see if it works...How do I do more than one request at a time.  Can you call me a x33399?

Per our meeting, attached are the current forms of MAC Clauses.  I have added 
at the end of the list, the Event of Default for change in ownership because 
I know that one comes up frequently.  Also, I don't know if you want to also 
suggest that the other trading groups work from our guaranty forms as well as 
our LC form.

The Legal heads of each of the trading groups are:

Mark Taylor:  Financial Trading
Jeff Hodge:  Physical Gas Trading
Elizabeth Sager:  Physical Power Trading
Alan Aronowitz:  Physical Global Markets (Liquids, Plastics, Coal, Emissions 
& Metals)
Julie Murray:  Physical Industrial Markets (Pulp & Paper, Steel)


Mark Greenberg asked me to send you the Password Application to be used for 
the brokers.  Actually, there will not be a Password Application.  What they 
will be signing instead is the attached Fee Agreement.   Any questions, call

I ran it by Mark and he has no strong feeling one way or another about the

Hi Mark and Tana,

I called the Dept. of the interior and was subsequently given the number to 
the Director's office.  I was told that anyone there could help me. and I 
asked the woman who answered the phone what the legal name is.  She stated 
that the legal name is Minerals Management Service.  I asked if U.S. Dept. of 
Interior should be included as part of the legal name.  She said that it 
should appear as follows:

       U.S. Department of the Interior 
       Minerals Management Service

I'm about to make the correction in Global Counterparty.   Do you have any 
objection to putting a comma between them, because we do not have 2 lines to 
set it up in GCP as written above?

Per the directions of Sam Schott, I am forwarding this email on to you.  I 
discussed the counterparty name "Minerals Management Service" with my boss, 
Mark Taylor, General Counsel of ENA, and he agreed that agencies and 
departments of the US government should have the correct governmental 
agency/department as part of the counterparty name.  You could say "Minerals 
Management Service" is a dba for the US Department of the Interior.  We 
generally do not like to contract with dbas, we want the legal entity as part 
of the name.  A more appropriate name for this counterparty is "US Department 
of the Interior Minerals Management Service".  The way the exposure rolls up 
under the GCP System is an exposure issue, not a contract issue.  If you 
disagree with this assessment, please call Mark Taylor at x37459.

Hi Tana,

I tend to agree with you, however, that's the verified name in the GCP 
System. Exposure roll-up should be fine, being that it's Ultimate Parent is 
the Government of the United States. If you have proof of a CP Name 
discrepancy, it should be directed to Global SAP (Cheryl Johnson, x3-3101).

I'm not so sure I agree with your name change for US Department of the

agency.  Anything else would be misleading to what it actually is.  I think 
more appropriate would be United States Department of the Interior, Minerals

Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want
to do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't
thought through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like
on online documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full
novation of the trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until
we hear back from them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers
Trust financial trades and master sit.

The GSCI contract is based on a basket of 26 commodities traded on a variet=

representing approximately 75% of the index.

Each Clearing Member providing sufficient documentation of a properly=20

I left you a voicemail yesterday about getting a master in place with 
Anadarko located here in Houston so they can trade Brent Crude and IPE 
lookalikes on EnronOnline under a master instead of a GTC.  We have an ISDA 
in place with Anadarko, but since ECTRIC is the counterparty online for those 
products, the trades wouldn't go under the ENA master.  The trader is 
pestering me about this.

What I would like to do is handle getting this ISDA in place with ECTRIC here 
in Houston, if that's OK with you, just mirroring the US master (except 
getting a Multicurrency in place since we have a Local Currency in place with 
ENA).  Is that OK with you?  Is Ian a lawyer, paralegal or Credit person?  Also, Mark mentioned the London 
Legal has been restructured somehow, and he asked me to ask you if could you 
fax us an org chart that shows the structure...?

I hear you got a fancy new car!

Great idea - here's our latest ISDA schedule (note the changes to law, 
process agent, notices, tax reps, etc)

If you work with Ian, that would be grand

I don't think I need new tires, unless I'm surprised.  You might want to buy 
an extra tire in case you get a flat.  I think I loaned Harry my old spare 
tire.  Anytime Saturday is fine...

I know I'm a pest...but we've got another gov't agency that doesn't have its 
legal entity as part of the name.  This one is on the list of 2/21/01, and it 
is the Western Area Power Administration, a division of the Department of 
Energy, acting through it "CRSP" area (I'm not sure what that stands for, 
it's the Central something something area) (ID#71175).

This particular counterparty has come up before on EOL, acting through 
another area, the Upper Great Plains Area (ID#81177).  The way I had this 
counterparty approved for EOL (I thought!) was:  Western Area Power 
Administration-Upper Great Plains, a Division of the United States Department 
of Energy.

I don't know if we can go back and get this one fixed too, but it would sure 
make Legal happy if we did...----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 02/28/2001 05:18 PM -----

replacement.

"The parties acknowledge and understand that this agreement does not limit

The below language is acceptable; however, I would suggest it be placed as
the first sentence of Paragraph 3, if it remains TradeSpark's position that
the existing first sentence of this paragraph (beginning with "Except as
otherwise provided ....") is to be deleted.  If the existing first sentence
is to remain, the language you propose should be added as the second
sentence of paragraph 3.

Please confirm the above and I will move forward on finalizing the
agreement.

I believe I understand your concerns - I would like to suggest that we add
the following language after the first sentence of Paragraph 3 - and then
execute the Agreement.

Stephen -

Since we keep missing each other, I wanted to drop you a note about the
comments TradeSpark made to the Enron NDA.

As to the comments:

Paragraph 1 - The changes are acceptable.

Paragraph 3 - The rationale for this deletion needs to be provided.  I
cannot see why this change was made or is necessary.

Paragraph 5 - This deletion is unacceptable to Enron.

When you get a chance, please call me to further discuss Paragraph 3.

Thanks.

Jason, our new computer floortech, has discovered why we can't get into the 
system.  He spoke to the Tradespark people and Tradespark is an NT system, 
and they won't have Microsoft 2000 compatibility for several months.  We 
cannot install NT on each of your individual computers, Jason says you can 
only have one system at any given time, so I have asked him to locate an 
unused terminal on the floor and install NT on that computer.  As soon as we 
have it up and running, I will let you know and you will have to do your 
review at that terminal.

Thanks for your patience.


The fellow from Alliant keeps calling me to check on the status of his access 
to EnronOnline.  We received the executed ETA Amendment about 3 weeks ago and 
he is really hot to trade.  Can you give me some estimate of when we can 
expect to get him out of Credit, or call him if there are some credit 
issues?  His name is Steve Castleberg and his ph: is 608/877-8207.  Thanks!Attached is the link that will give you view access to the Financial Trading 
Agreement Database.  View access is available to all Enron employees, so you 
can pass this link on to other members of your department or your dealmakers.

Attached are the referenced lists.  If the Credit Counterparty is "amended" I 
don't have any changes to what I've previously said about the counterparty 
unless I add "w/change" (which I didn't have any on these lists, so just keep 
the Legal approvals the same).   The only counterparty on the 12/22/99 list 
was a "read only" counterparty, so I didn't bother responding to that list.  
For physical power, again, even 'tho I'm not saying it, "no" for European 
based physical power products. 


Did either of you send this agreement to Anthony.

We now have a computer set up so you can view the TradeSpark website.  It is 
located in a cubicle across from the C-1 conference room (on the side 
opposite of me, at EB3858D).  Since it has taken us so long to get access 
into this website, it is critical that each of you review your products 
descriptions of the website AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  Can you each please confirm 
to me that you have completed your review and if you have any issues with the 
product descriptions please pass them on to Sheri Thomas with EnronOnline.

If for any reason you continue to have computer problems, please call Jason,

Tana, 

The Tradespark PC has been installed in EB3858D. I created a local account 
for all the lawyers to use to login, the userid is tradespark and the 
password is tradespark. Once they login, they will doubleclick on the 
tradespark icon on the desktop and will be at the tradespark login window. 
The userid should already be in place, but if not, it is netnrg3 and the 
password is espeed. That should get them into the tradespark system. Now, 
once Tradespark has come out with a version that is W2k compatible, we will 
install the application on each of their PC's for their convenience. Let me 
know if you need any further information. As always, I am here to help.

                                   Thanks,

Did you want this cpy on the list for Legal/Credit meeting?  ERMS hasn't been 
expanded as an Enron company to be added to list for discussion at meeting, 
and we have some old ERMS era masters people are working on that aren't 
getting discussed, and some ERMS era masters that should be unchecked so we 
do not discuss them at meeting.Please remember that when adding a new counterparty whose name start with the 
word "The", the "The" should go out the end of the name in brackets.  An 
example is "Times Mirror Company (The)".  This will help our searching 
capability.

Thanks.You might want to talk to your Credit team about the Top Ten List for the 
Legal/Credit meeting.  I think we're only at 3 top ten.Well, I got your new website added as a shortcut in my mail directory, so now 
I can bother you at will!  Watch what you pray for, you just might get it!

We had a rather uninspiring flight back from New York, Craig watched 
"Inspector Gadget" on the inflight movie(he said it was really bad) and 
Danelia read the Bible the whole way.  The only good news is we arrive 1/2 
hour early!

The weather was so warm in Houston that we had to turn the air on in the 
car.  It cooled off a bit today and we need sweaters.  When I got home I 
spent the rest of yesterday moving my plants back out of the garage where I 
moved them for the freeze that never arrived.  That's one thing I hate about 
Houston winters, you can never count on it staying cold so I have to keep 
moving the plants in and out.  

After that, I aired out my house and vacuumed from the stinky kitty litter 
box.  Then I ordered in Chinese and read three days of newspapers.  Very 
relaxing!  Don't I have an exciting life?

Keep in touch...

We just opened the above counterparty to trade UK financial crude products 
online.  Since the Enron counterparty for these products is ECTRIC we will 
need to get a master in place between ECTRIC and Counterparty.  Justin Boyd 
in London has graciously agreed to let us handle drafting and negotiation of 
the master.  Could you please provide us with credit for this master.  I 
don't know if we can just mirror the credit terms in the old master or not.  
Since the old master is a Local Currency Master, we cannot do a simple dupe 
and change it for UK issues.  I would suggest unless we really have problems 
with issues, we more or less try to sign the same paper whenever possible.

Of course, send the credit worksheet for the new master to the paralegals for 
the rotation.Attached for transmittal to your customer is the Prebon BETA and Fee 
Agreement amended to reflect the changes from the LOI.  I am also attaching a 
blackline so you can see the changes from the first draft.



You should now have edit capability in the Financial Trading Agreements 
Database.

Do you have a contact at the Counterparty?  It is not where they are 
headquartered that necessarily matters, but where they are incorporated.

Are we sure that the above counterparty is US and not Canadian?
Attached is a clean and a blacklined draft of the BETA.  This draft was 
created using the new BETA form, and the blackline compares this draft 
against the form.  I have also attached a blackline from the intial draft we 
sent counterparty to the draft we are sending counterparty now, in case you 
want to show them all the changes from that draft.  That blackline is called 
prebon.red below.

Tana,

I have received the quote for the new files for your area.  The 5-drawer 
files are $682 each and the 2-drawers are $362 each for a total of $5,948 
(includes tax).  If you want me to proceed with the order, please send me an 
authorizing email.  Also, I still need to know how you would like the 
cabinets to be keyed: all alike, split by banks (by groups) or individually, 
or a combination of the last two options.  I can submit this purchase order 
now without this information, but will need that shortly.

I will be out of May 26-28, so if you have any questions, please contact Pat 
Scarborough (x35368).

Just a check, my notes in the database say we had this counterparty open for 
power, but when I check on profile manager, they have a read only status.  Do 
we want them open for power or not?Sorry about that Edmund.  The forms have been moved out of the atty.fms bank 
into their own subdirectory called "Swap Forms" (look it up just like a 
person's named directory).   Let me know whether you can access that database 
from London.  We had London set up to review the atty.fms bank only, I don't 
know if you can access other subdirectories.

We have made some substantive revisions to the ISDA Schedule and Credit 
Support Annex, so you might want to take a look.  If you can't do a 
comparewrite from London, let me know and I'll email you the blacklined 
forms.  We've also made changes to the forms of guarantees.  They are now 
located in a document called Guaranty.doc in the Swap Forms/Current Forms 
directory.

Also, the ISDA definitions have been changed since you've been gone, you may 
already know that, but just in case...I thought I'd bring it up.My database is not showing that I've looked at this counterparty before, so I 
need to know if they are an ESP, or not?We have a master swap agreement in place with Energy West Incorporated, a 
CANADA corporation.  Your list shows "Inc." instead of "Incorporated", and 
that it is a US corporation.  Is this the same counterparty?Edmund Cooper just called and wanted to know what form changes we have made 
as a result of the new CFTC Rules.  I told him we just met on that yesterday, 
and as soon as we revised the form, we would send it to London.  Also, if 
there will be any changes in our advice to the traders resulting from this, 
please let him and he will disseminate the information to London Legal.Do you know who in London is actually updating Legal's comments to Profile 
Manager?  I can't believe Justin does this everyday?!I'm with you on Montana.  I checked the files in the big file room, and it is 
a Montana corporation.

This counterparty came thru on 2/28/01 list.  I checked my database and we

Hi Tana, when I spoke to you last week regarding the FedEx bill charged to 
one of our customer (Lake Side Packers) you gave the company number which is 
great then you gave me a billing code.  Accounting has come back to me 
indicating that they need a cost centre.  The billing code number apparently 
does not mean anything to them.  Can you please forward me the cost centre to 
which this FedEx bill should be charged to.  Thank you in advance for your 
help.

Angela This link should get you access to our Financial Trading, or "Master Swap 
Agreement" database.  This database lists all the master swap agreements we 
have in place or have drafted in the US, London, Singapore, Japan, South 
America, etc..  It is a very good resource to use when preparing 
confirmations.  This database is available to all Enron employees, so feel 
free to send this link to any London employees you think might find it 
helpful.  There are certain comments concerning the status of masters under 
negotiation that are only available to Legal and Credit employees because of 
legal-client confidentiality concerns.  Any member of your legal team should 
be able to look at those comments to determine if there is active/close 
negotiation on a master, or if a master is being amended, what the amendments 
might address (sometimes helpful when Houston isn't at work yet!).  
Frequently there may be more than one master in place for an Enron company, 
so look at each entry to determine whether the master is limited to a 
specific finance project or product (unusual, but sometimes).  Also, as I 
mentioned, not all the US based masters are ISDA Multi-Currency Masters, so 
look to confirm what type of master we entered into.  If they are not ISDA 
Multi-Currency Masters, it may not be possible to put a cross-border trade 
under the master without some modification to the master or confirmation.

Please note:  there is a listing for "Restrictions" which will reflect any 
trading limitations such as "crude oil trades only", "no trades over 2 
years", contain special confirmation issues or list other types of trading 
limitations.  Restrictions should ALWAYS be looked at because they contain 
critical trading guidance.  Another note to watch out for is that many US 
based master may have Texas law instead of NY.  Certainly not UK law.  We 
hope to have that information available in the database in the future.

If for some reason you can't access this database, let me know and we'll get 
our respective computer people to figure out why.

As I mentioned, I am a paralegal in the Houston swap group and am happy to 
answer any questions about particular masters, so please do not hesitate to 
call me at x33399.

I've had no list come throught with this counterparty.  What's the scoop?  
Will it be on tomorrow's list?Nope, not yet.  I'm absolutely swamped...!!!  I haven't forgotten about it 
tho.  My short agenda is Day 1:  Go over basics of financial documentation 
w/confirm desk team & your assistants (maybe 2-4 hours depending on level of 
detail we go into) (spend rest of day approving online counterparties), Day 
2:  Go over specifics of confirmations with your assistants so they can 
prepare the Special Legal/Credit Annex for a confirm and review how to read a 
credit worksheet and what the credit issues mean (spend rest of day approving 
online counterparties), Day 3:  Spend time with you & Peter going over what I 
went over with assistants & confirm people, then maybe spend time letting any 
of your dealmakers quiz me as they desire about swap issues (spend free time 
approving online counterparties).

Don't add a lot of people on, I get really nervous speaking in front of large 
groups...I am a shy girl, you know!

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

Notice No. 01-26
January 19, 2001

TO:
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING FIRMS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION OPERATIONS MANAGERS

FROM:
Neal Wolkoff
Executive Vice President

SUBJECT:
MARGIN RATE CHANGE: FEBRUARY, MARCH, AND APRIL 2001 CONTRACTS ONLY

Effective Date:  Friday, January 19, 2001 (close of business).
Futures Contract: Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures.
Contract Months: February, March, and April 2001 Contracts Only.
Rate Change:

NYMEX Division Margins for the February and March 2001
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts Only

Effective Date:  Friday, January 19, 2001 (close of business).

Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin): Old:  $14,000  New:  $12,000
Member Customer (Initial Margin): Old:  $15,400  New:  $13,200
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin): Old:  $18,900  New:  $16,200

NYMEX Division Margins for the April 2001
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract Only

Effective Date:  Friday, January 19, 2001 (close of business.)
Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin): Old:  $5,000   New:  $6,000
Member Customer (Initial Margin): Old:  $5,500   New:  $6,600
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin): Old:  $6,750   New:  $8,100

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by 
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads 
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the 
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Note the outright margin 
level required for the February and March 2001 contracts, the April 2001 
contract, and all subsequent contracts differ.  Spreading between differently 
margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than between equally 
margined contracts.  Below are provided three spread scenarios where the legs 
of the spread are margined differently.

Scenario One
A spread consisting of one leg in either the February 2001 or March 2001 
contracts and another in the April 2001 contract will have its requirement 
(at the clearing member rates) calculated at $8,500 starting on Friday, 
January 19, 2001.

Example at Clearing Member Rates
One Long February 2001 or March 2001 NG (1 x $12,000) =    $12,000
One Short April 2001 NG   (1 x $6,000) =-   $6,000
Net Scan Risk    ($12,000-$6,000)=    $6,000
Spread Rate    (1x $2,500) =+   $2,500
Total Requirement     =    $8,500

Scenario Two
A spread consisting of one leg in either the February 2001 or March 2001 
contracts and another in any month following the April 2001 contract will 
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $9,500 
starting on Friday, January 19, 2001.

Example at Clearing Member Rates
One Long February 2001 or March 2001 NG (1 x $12,000) = $12,000
One Short May 2001 - January 2004 NG (1 x $5,000) =      -$5,000
Net Scan Risk    ($12,000-$5,000)= $7,000
Spread Rate    (1x $2,500) =      +$2,500
Total Requirement    =        $  9,500
Scenario Three
A spread consisting of one leg in the April 2001 contract and another in any 
month following the April 2001 contract will have its requirement (at the 
clearing member rates) calculated at $3,500 starting on Friday, January 19, 
2001.
Example at Clearing Member Rates
One Long April 2001 NG          (1 x $6,000)    =        $  6,000
One Short May 2001 - January 2004 NG       (1 x $5,000)    =   -     $  5,000
Net Scan Risk                         ($6,000-$5,000)  =        $  1,000
Spread Rate                          (1x $2,500)     =   +     $  2,500
Total Requirement                                 =        $  3,500

Summary of NYMEX Division Margins on Natural Gas Futures Spreads
Scenario One: February or March 2001 Contracts versus the April 2001 Contract
Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):               $  8,500
Member Customer (Initial Margin):                   $  9,350
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):               $11,475
Scenario Two: February or March 2001 Contracts versus Contracts following the 
April 2001 Contract
Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):               $  9,500
Member Customer (Initial Margin):                   $10,450
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):               $12,825
Scenario Three: April 2001 Contract versus Contracts following the April 2001 
Contract
Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):               $  3,500
Member Customer (Initial Margin):                   $  3,850
Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):               $  4,725

McCoy at (212) 299-2928 or Joe Sanguedolce at (212) 299-2855.  This notice 
supersedes all previous notices regarding outright margins for the NYMEX

Attached is the referenced counterparty approval list.  Per earlier emails, 
no U.S. counterparty should be approved for european power until we hear 
otherwise.

Also, per my email yesterday, CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Company was 
already approved yesterday to do basis financial.  All other prior approvals 
for that counterparty should stay the same.

Yes, legal is OK with this.  Trades executed from the London desk will be 
arranged through EEFT; trades executed from the New York desk will not need 
to be.  In either case, the Enron principal to the transaction would be 
ECTRIC.

Hi Tana,

Further to Karen Lambert's email below, could you please let me know what the 
status is with SaskEnergy?  Are they understanding the fact that their EOL 
transactions will fall under the Master Agreement's terms and conditions?

Let me know if I need to contact them.  Thanks,

Hi Karen,

Did you follow up with this counterparty yet?  If not, I'll look after it.  I 
just don't want both of us calling her.  Thanks.

Subject: EOL Help Desk Question, CP ID 5177 SaskEnergy Incorporated, Global 
Contract 96013849

FYI -- The counterparty question below includes reference to a Canadian 
Physical Gas master contract for online trading.  I am not certain which 
other agreement they are questioning (online GTC? online ETA? other master 
contract?).  When I tried to contact the counterparty her voice mail states 
that Debbie is out of the office until March 6th.  At this point, I am unsure 
if this is a purely "Canada gas" question or if they have questions that 
cross-commodities and locations.  No specific action is needed by your 
group.  I just want to make sure you are aware of any Canadian contract 
issues.   (There is an open EOL Help Desk ticket pending until this question 
is resolved.)  Please let me know if you have any questions or new 
information that might help resolve this issue.

Thank you,
Karen

I just spoke to Mike Garred and John Raineri w/The New Power Company.  Per 
this conv. it appears that ENA has master agreements in place to trade 
financial and physical gas.  I directed him to Shari Stack, a lawyer in the 
power group, to discuss getting a master agreement in place with EPMI to 
trade physical power.  They are aware that Credit is working on getting them 
some headroom, and as soon as they counterparty comes out of Credit, we'll 
get them approved to trade (pending resolution of physical power approval 
from Shari). 

If Credit could verbally let me know when they are approved I'd appreciate 
it, so I'll know to look for them.  I will be traveling to Calgary Tuesday, 
so I may be incommunicado while the plane's in flight, so that could possibly 
hold things up.

All those traps with security were worked out 4 years ago.  London can get 
into the o: drive from there, the only directory they have access to in the 
o: drive is the atty.fms bank.  If we put the swap forms back there, they can 
get at them.  I know, because I've pulled them up myself from London.

Mary,

I have spoken to Taffy regarding this matter.  She said that even if we move 
the forms within atty.fms, that the satillite office will still not be able 
to access them.

The only way that the forms whether in stty.fms or SWAP FORMS can be only 
accessed if one can access our "o" drive.
Therefore, each satillite office must contact computer security @ Enron an 
request access to our "o" drive.

Thats the story.

It has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for 
master swap agreements only.  Having other documents listed in that section 
may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general 
trading purposes, such as Global Contracts.  That is why we created the 
"Other Agreements" section, to house these other agreements.  My 
understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the 
Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously.  
The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong 
agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been 
proliferating.  If my understanding is not correct, than when did the 
intentional use of that first section change?  I think putting all agreement 
is a very bad idea.

Mike,

I know I'm not supposed to continue imposing on you, but if these entries are 
showing up in both places this is going to creating large problems for us, as 
well as giving persons who should not have access to brokerage/other 
agreements access to that information.  Our brokers are quite confidential.  
The only information we want to make available to all Enron employees is the 
master swap agreements.  Can you PLEASE, PLEASE take a look at this for me.  
It is very critical that this drop down works correctly.

		 Subject: Call with Pirog


** PRIVATE **

Set forth is a brief summary of my call with John Pirog last night.  Overall, 
I felt we made a lot of progress.  At the end of the call, Pirog said that 
prior to the call he was uncertain whether a deal was possible, but at the 
end he said that he thought we could probably work through a number of the 
issues and he said he was going to send some sample language for our 
consideration on a few of the points.  We said that we would be begin to 
modify our draft as well to reflect some of the concepts we spoke about and 
that we could then "compare notes."  He said that CDWR viewed the Enron 
Contract as an important one and he said he would be back to us fairly 
quickly.

Material Regulatory Change Provision.  Pirog said CDWR would be willing to 
accept such a provision if it were limited to an event that adversely affects 
CDWR's ability to perform under the contract, most particularly its ability 
to pay for power.  (Such an event likely would be a CA legislature or 
regulatory generated change).  Pirog said he thought that CDWR would agree to 
a termination payment if this occurred, although they may not want the MRC to 
be characterized as a "default" (which should not be a problem from our 
standpoint).   CDWR would not be willing to protect EPMI for a change (e.g., 
in law) that materially affects EPMI's business, but does not adversely 
affect CDWR's ability to make payments to EPMI.  (For example, a new CA law 
that requires sellers into CA to turn over all their books and records to the 
CPUC).  Further, as we anticipated, he said CDWR was not willing to be on the 
hook for a termination payment for an event outside its control, such as a 
FERC change or Federal Legislation that adversely affects us.  However, he 
did say that CDWR might entertain a "no LD walk right" for EPMI if such a 
change adversely affected it.  My sense is that ultimately Pirog/CDWR will 
back track on that since such a change could occur when our contract is 
heavily in the money to CDWR and this would allow us an out without paying 
LDs.

Early Walk Provision.  He reiterated that CDWR would not extend the Option.  
With respect to the early walk away right that has been offered, it was 
discussed that this could be structured in such a way that EPMI could walk 
from the deal (without receiving or paying a Termination Payment) up until a 
date certain (September 1 and September 30 were mentioned by me as 
possibilities, although Pirog said that other suppliers had a shorter window) 
(our request is based on the gloomy news that has been eminating from the CA 
Treasurer's office about the bond issue), provided that if the bonds were 
issued earlier than that, the walk away right would terminate; that is, EPMI 
would not be free to walk if CDWR was able to issue bonds with an investment 
grade rating prior to the Drop Dead Date.

Termination Payment Due Date.   Pirog said CDWR cannot shorten it from 180 
days.  He said all other suppliers have lived with that.  Pirog is 
sympathetic to our concerns, but said that the "bond guys" are already 
nervous about only having 180 days (if they had to issue bonds to pay the 
LDs).

Suspension of Delivery.  Emphasizing our concern with the 180 days, I 
requested that CDWR provide some flexibility on our right to suspend 
perfromance in the event of an event of default and, perhaps some other 
events, such as a bond downgrade.  Pirog said he thought CDWR could work with 
us on that.

Downgrade not a Default.  CDWR was not willing to have a bond downgrade an 
event of default.  However, he said CDWR would be willing to consider having 
a Downgrade Event a "no LD walk right" for EPMI and perhaps an event 
justifying EPMI in suspending deliveries.  In other words, a Downgrade Event 
would be treated like an Event of Default, but no termination payment would 
be owed and EPMI would have the flexibility to suspend performance.  Pirog 
also discussed adding a covenant that CDWR would attempt to secure a Credit 
Rating with respect to the claims paying ability of the Fund in the event 
that no bonds were issued.  That is, if no Bonds were outstanding and the 
Fund did not have an investment grade rating, we could terminate, but without 
LDs.

Cross Defaults.  This clearly is one of CDWR's hot buttons, and we will not 
be able to get this is my sense.  However, when asked about the idea of a 
Cross Default Out w/out a termination payment, he stated that he would like 
to discuss that further with CDWR.

LD Calculation Methodology.  Pirog said it was very unlikely CDWR would 
accept our proposed language.  He said they are striving for consistency 
among contracts and said their proposal is viewed as more "objective."  My 
sense is that we will need to get comfortable with it in general.

Arbitration.  In general, Pirog did not have a problem, except for the 
following: a desire to limit it to contractual claims only (i.e., no tort 
actions, extra-contractual disputes, etc. would be subject to it).  Also, 
holding hearings in New York City was not well received, and a request was 
made that all three arbitrators be neutral.  I would think that the situs 
issue will be a big one for Richard Sanders in light of the political 
environment if a dispute were to arise.  My general sense, however, is that 
this is not a "deal breaker" for CDWR.

Assignment.  In general, he understood the nature of our changes on this 
issue and said they were reasonable although he caveated that on this issue 
as well they are looking  for some consistency.  We were again asked if 
assignment back to the IOUs would be acceptable, even though he knew what our 
reaction would be.  Pirog offered to provide us sample language, which we 
said we would look at.  We stated that conceptually this would be a difficult 
sell in light of the environment.  He did not elaborate on how stringent the 
assignment standards are in the other deals.

New Govt Charge Pass Throughs.  A pass through of some governmental charges 
was considered to be okay, but he said our proposed language was too broad.  
Pirog offered to provide some examples of acceptable language on this.  He di 
agre, howeve, that if for example, CA imposed an excess profits tax, that it 
was fair for us to be protected from that.

Legal Opinions.  Pirog did not think that a legal opinion from Hawkins would 
be forthcoming, although he did say that he would look into whether or not 
they would be providing one on the bonds.  Also, he said it was a possibility 
that the California Attorney General would issue the opinion on the bonds, so 
we might possibly ask for that in lieu of an opinion from Hawkins.  
Realistically, it likely will be very difficult to get this before we have to 
extend the option; perhaps, we can put in a covenant on CDWR to get us that 
before our walk right expires.

Additional CDWR Covenants.  Pirog stated that the additional covenants we 
have requested are conceptually okay with him, but need to be discussed 
internally with CDWR.

Pro Rata "Spread" Amortization.  Pirog had not reviewed the idea of 
amortizing the Credit Amount over the four year term, and said that he would 
run it by CDWR.

CDWR Information.  Pirog said he would follow up with CDWR on how often it 
plans to give suppliers financial information.  He was resisting our request 
for monthly information, although I pointed out that we really only wanted 
information that frequently in the beginning of the transaction as things 
start to fall into place.

Let me know when you wish to follow up.

John

I know I'm not supposed to continue imposing on you, but if these entries are

You need to speak with the developer.  There is no way to control the

It has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for 
master swap agreements only.  Having other documents listed in that section 
may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general 
trading purposes, such as Global Contracts.  That is why we created the 
"Other Agreements" section, to house these other agreements.  My 
understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the 
Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously.  
The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong 
agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been 
proliferating.  If my understanding is not correct, than when did the 
intentional use of that first section change?  I think putting all agreement 
is a very bad idea.

If anyone should need ANY assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me at 
x5-3317.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Will you be at the same dinner?  How goes the house?John, it's good to hear from you!

A few things on your paralegal friend.  First, we don't currently have any 
openings, though we have tended to hire paralegals with a lot of experience.  
Most of the paralegals in our group have about 15-25 years experience.  Also, 
we recently hired someone, and I don't anticipate us hiring for awhile.

Most of Enron's litigation work is done out of Enron Corp.  They do have a 
big litigation group up there, and that would be the most obvious place to 
start.  Chuck Cheek is the head lawyer for that group.  You could forward her 
resume up there with a note, it might get it more personal attention.  Also, 
keep watching (or she can watch, it online) the job bank, they advertise 
paralegal jobs there from time to time with all the Enron companies.

Another group that might be interested in hiring paralegals, and might hire 
paralegals with less experience, is the Global Contracts Group headed up by 
Mary Solmonson.  They're always looking for people, and it might be a good 
way for your friend to get her foot in the door at ECT.  Also, if her 
undergraduate degree was in business, obviously, she might have some more 
options in other groups.

As far as running goes, I'm trying to get back into shape.  I'm just 
surviving 3 miles around the park, and this weekend I plan to double my 
mileage to 6.  It sounds like we're both not in fighting form.  But I do want 
to start training in July with Houston Fit for the Houston Marathon again.  I just did a request to get Angela Davis in the Houston Office and Linda 
Sietzema and Sharon Crawford in the Calgary offices edit access to the 
Financial Trading Agreement Database.  I also requested that Marcus Nettelton 
get edit access to the ENA Legal Online Trading Database.  I'm not sure if I 
did the "erequest" all ok.  Can you check to make sure your got all four?  
Thanks!

I will be having about 5-7 other people that I will need added to this

through the system as well?

Also, there are two ways of getting edit access through this database.  One 
is for employees of Legal, who can then enter Legal comments, and the other 
is for employees of Credit, who can then enter Credit comments.  Do you see 
that choice?  Is there some way for me to verify which employees of Legal and 
which employees of Credit have what access?  I know that some employees of 
Credit have Legal access by mistake.  Can I get lists of the Legal and Credit

Elisabeth:

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the "trade options exemption" and as to the 
parties being "eligible swap participants" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

Martin
It would be nice if you could be at my dinner, since I probably won't know 
anyone else.  Anytime you want to go to lunch to check on the house status, 
I'd be glad to go...Your access to the financial trading agreement database is approved.  The

We have received executed copies of the Broker Electronic Transaction 
Agreement dated 3/19/01 and the Fee Agreement dated 3/19/01 with respect to 
the referenced Counterparty.  Copies will be sent to Lisa Lees.I just received a phone call from Paul Varana, outside counsel to the 
referenced counterparty.  His phone number is 713/752-4514.  He said that 
VEPCO wasn't happy with the form of GTC attached to the physical online power 
confirms and was going to be sending me a letter requesting certain 
revisions.  He said the letter would come from Francine Matthews at VEPCO.  I 
looked this counterparty up in my database, and it appears that we approved 
them to trade physical power with an override letter.  Usually, we don't 
allow any changes to the online GTC, but with physical power & the override 
letters, I know there is some wiggle room.  I don't know how you want to 
handle this, if you want to wait for the letter from VEPCO to come in and 
then deal with the issues, or head him off at the pass.  Just let me know.----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 03/21/2001 03:24 PM -----

The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements 
Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.  It is an 
Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to "Other 
Agreements".  Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the 
entry in  the master swap agreement database.  Thanks!

Tana,

This confirms our conversation today regarding Amerada Hess Corporation's
ability to trade on Enron On-line.  As discussed, I will check to see what
specific products we intend to trade with regard to Energy, Physicals,
and/or Derivatives.  I will also check to see whether we intend to trade in
the US, Canada, and/or Europe. I do understand that you cannot give me an
accurate answer as to our ability to trade On-line until I provide this to
you.  Thank you for getting back to me so quickly, I will try to do the
same.

Regards,

Dana M. Dellacona
1185 Avenue of the Americas
NY, NY 10036
Ph:212.536.8133
Fx:917.342.8810
ddellacona@hess.com

As an introduction:  The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out 
the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not 
all of the products it wants to trade).

When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved 
to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the 
European products, including specifically European physical power products 
(which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).

Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to 
check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the 
products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).

What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with 
respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap 
Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, 
which I never open them for.  Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone 
up for unless we really mean it.

So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian 
based products (especially physical power).  If you didn't, then I am going 
to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down 
for European physical power.

Russell,

Stephanie called yesterday and said this counterparty called EOL and wanted 
to get opened to trade financial online and get an ISDA in place.

I spoke to Tom Moran about this counterparty this morning to see if we saw 
them as a swap counterparty before I called them, and Tom told me that he did 
not think Credit wanted to trade financial with this counterparty.  He asked 
me to pass the counterparty's name & number on to you so you could give them 
a call to break the news to them.  The woman who called is named karen and 
her no. is 713/974-9394.

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."  
or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".

they're fine for non US & Canadian based products (including physical power)

Subject: Amerada-Hess Corporation

As an introduction:  The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out 
the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not 
all of the products it wants to trade).

When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved 
to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the 
European products, including specifically European physical power products 
(which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).

Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to 
check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the 
products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).

What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with 
respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap 
Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, 
which I never open them for.  Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone 
up for unless we really mean it.

So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian 
based products (especially physical power).  If you didn't, then I am going 
to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down 
for European physical power.





Attached is my list that I use as a reference.  Please let me know if you 
disagree with any of the European advice.

Tana -

Peter's message below contains a form of NDA that was provided to New World 
by both EBS and Enron Puerto Rico.  While I realize they are not Net Works, 
if this form is acceptable, do we have to have special approval from ENW 
management to use a different form?  Let me know because I have no problem

Lou,

Attached is the requested NDA with Enron Networks.  I added in the business
purpose regarding the Online Website.  This is form of the Enron NDAs
negotiated with Enron Broadband Services and Enron Puerto Rico.  This form
is different from the form Enron Net Works sent you as referenced below.  In
order to keep our NDAs consistent, David thought it would be best to stick
with one form agreement.  This form was the one sent to us by the other 2
Enrons - not our form.

Per the email below, I looked in the financial trading agreement database and 
saw that Stephanie Panus, a paralegal in our group prepared an Annex B for 
this counterparty in January of this year.  I would just confirm that the 
credit is the same and then use the same Annex B as before.  I am going to 
fax the credit worksheet that Credit send Stephanie in January so you can 
check the credit.  Below is the Annex B Stephanie prepared.

As Canada is now executing these confirms, please get with Tana, or someone

to standard procedures that the Legal group in Houston handles.  I did, 
though, make a mistake on Cash Collateral, you are correct there is no cash 
collateral in Canada. Please disregard that 'X' for both counterparty's.  In 
regards to the complete name of Slater Steel, as I explain in the comments of 
the worksheet, a previous transaction was executed with a credit annex 
attached to the confirm.  Once again, Tana or someone in legal, can explain 
to you the database they have that would give you all this information.

Russell, sorry, I should have reviewed the entire credit sheet before

1. What is the complete name of Slater Steel?
2. Who is their guarantor?
3. What does "NW" before the C$188MM under "Guarantor") mean?
4. Cash Collateral??
5. What are the 3rd Party debt threshold amounts (Events of Default) for each 
of Slater's Guarantor and Enron Corp.?
6. Is Enron Corp.'s MAC debt rating BBB-?
7. Why is the Counterparty "X'd" under the MAC if there is a guarantor?

I think that are all of the questions I have for now.  Please advise.

Tana-

I work in the Tax Department with Mark Ng and I was wondering if you had the 
information on which entities will be included in the ENA footnote as of 
12/31/00.  If you are not the right person to contact on this matter, I 
apologize for taking up your time.  Please let me know the contact on this if 
possible.


Thank you,

We are trying to track down the signed documents for this counterparty.  Our 
notes reflect that Samantha Boyd sent them up to Peter for execution on 
3/9/01 with instructions to send them back to Samantha Boyd when executed.  
My understanding is that they were signed in Canada and returned to Samantha, 
but they have not yet shown up here.  If you sent them fedex and can track 
them via a tracking number can you see if you can find them.  They appear to 
have done some unauthorized trades w/o having the master signed and this has 
now become a really high priority.

Things are looking better.  We tracked down the documents and it appears that 
Samantha sent them to counterparty's outside counsel on 3/15/01.  I just 
spoke to Maureen Donley-Hoopes at outside counsel and asked her to fax me the 
signature pages of the ISDA and counterparty's guaranty to me ASAP.  Once we 
get those Russell will be a happy man and we can send a confirm out under the 
ISDA.  I'll let you know as soon as we get the fax in.Brant, please do not put me on emails for day to day business, drafts of 
masters and confirms.  Thanks.

Trade qy8453 and qy9133 were both approved under the same credit terms.  The 
$4MM LC that has been specified as an independant amount and the associated 
$6MM credit line should be made a part of both confirmations and tied to both 
deals.  Approval of these deals was based on the combined risk profile of the 
trades, so securitization of both trades should be amalgamated.

Can I just get a status report on the NDA that you've sent out for me.  I 
want to verify that Spectron and TFS have not executed the NDA yet.

Thanks,

What do you think about Russell's request for a confirm here?  I think this 
is really confusing for our Canadian team.  There must be requirements for 
the LC if it's an upfront LC, we would need a zero threshold.  I just don't 
think this is very straight forward for these poor Candadian girls to figure 
out.  What do you think?

Linda & Sharon,

My primary job responsibility is to online trading, and right now EnronOnline 
is quite a beast of a customer.  Because of that I please ask that you direct 
any future questions you may have with respect to confirmations to our two 
paralegals who handle the day to day trading, Susan Bailey at x34737 and 
Stephanie Panus at x53249.  

With respect to the two current Canadian confirmations, Sara Shackleton, an 
attorney in our Group, is working with Credit to resolve the questions on the 
Slater Steel and Casco credit worksheets.We have received the originally signed copy (via fax) of the Termination 
Agreement dated 3/15/01 with respect to EnronOnlineTransactions Nos. 10000172 
and 1000173.  Copies will be distributed.OK with me!At the request of Daniel Diamond, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Non-Disclosure Agreement.   If the enclosed meets with your approval, please 
execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will 
then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please 
call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or me at (713) 
853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you.





I am OK with what Credit say, which is if the counterparties are already 
approved for trading those pulp & lumber products theyan trade the new 
products, except for the following counterparties which we need to be careful 
about becuase they could only tansact newsprint:

The Bakersfield Californian:  can transact only newsprint
E.W. Scripps Company (The) can only transact 48.8 gram newsprint swaps

I have a favour - Jon McKay of our office is wondering if you have any record 
of a deal with TMG Financial Products Inc. that is a one-off transaction 
dealing with "credit sleeving"?

All we have here is a copy of an ISDA with them - not what he's looking for.

We are closing to finalizing a Lotus Notes Database for us to keep track of 
approvals for online trading counterparties and any amendments to online 
trading documents.  Once the database is done, I (and you, I guess) will have 
to input the data for the Houston and London based Credit counterparties.  I 
am forward to you this early draft of the database for you to see what it 
looks like.  You will have to go into "create new counterparty" to see the 
format once you opened the database up.

 We're still revising it to add a drop down for amendments to online trading 
documents, and then we're going to have a sort similar to the Pending Swap 
Update sort on Lotus Notes, that will show the Counterparty Name, Approved 
for Online Trading:  Yes or No, and then follow with any amendments to the 
online agreements.

This will, obviously, help us keep track of if and why we've approved a 
counterparty, and also help us generate reports to the online trading team.

Access will currently be granted to the same people who have access to the 
Master Swap Agreement Database.  If you have any additional Credit Online 
People to add let me know.

We hope to have it ready within the week so we can start populating it with 
the information.

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."  
or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".

Reggie just brought around a whole stack of confirms of pulp & paper deals 
that came into the fax area.  Is anyone looking for this stack of confirms?  
If not, I'll have Reggie walk them down to Joe Hunter.I tracked down the culprit who worked on this master and it was Mark Taylor.  
I know he called Jon McKay and had a conversation with him about it and is 
looking at the master for particular issues in response to his conversation 
with Jon.

Tana,

I have a favour - Jon McKay of our office is wondering if you have any record 
of a deal with TMG Financial Products Inc. that is a one-off transaction 
dealing with "credit sleeving"?

All we have here is a copy of an ISDA with them - not what he's looking for.

Thanks

Tana,

Per my voice mail to you this week, I have obtained the information which
you requested regarding Amerada Hess Corporation's ability to trade on Enron
On-Line.

Amerada Hess Corporation would like to trade gas and power, financial and
physical, in the United States and Canada.

We would also like to trade options for gas and power.

Could you run the necessary reports and contact me with our current ability
to trade On-Line?  Also, if we do not presently have the ability to trade
the above, could you inform me as to the steps which need to be taken in
order to trade?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Mark,

Global Counterparty wants me to approve this EOL counterparty which is a 
division.  My deal with the EOL team was that they would kick these 
counterparties back and try to get the legal incorporated entity as part of 
the name.  Global Counterparty is satisfied opening counterparties up as 
divisions and I am getting frustrated constantly fighting this battle.  Do 
you wish to intercede, or shall I give up and let counterparties be opened as 
divisions?  Do you want to call a meeting with Sam's boss to discuss 
divisions?  What to do?

CP/ID 94330, Cargill Ferrous International

FYI...

Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty 
System as a Division of Cargill, Inc.
Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as 
such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link
to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure.

Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change 
documentation from the Counterparty
in order to change this name.

Hello,

Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent 
and child for our downstream systems.
GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the 
Tradename / Division name or Parent Name  - - not both simultaneously.
(Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the 
purpose of using a Tradename.

Best Rgds.

Samuel

Tana,
 
Please review the process below:

With divisions,  EOL does request a new Password Application for the 
applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.  When the company is set up 
in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP 
ID.  Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to 
establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.

Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see.  

Thanks,
Stephanie

Per conv. a minute ago with Marcus, Christi Nicolay in the Regulatory Group 
just checked and Ontario Power Generation does not have a FERC marketing 
license.  That leaves them to buying US power only (both east & west OK).  
Please make this change immediately.

		 Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)









I want a parking space in the new garage.  Please let me know what I need to 
do to get it!

		 Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)










Well, I guess we could.  since we needed to do it immediately, only Stepanie 
can only do it immediately.  Do you want me to change it, or, Stephanie, 
since you've already changed it will it be already changed tomorrow so we 
don't need to do anything.  I'm so confused?!!!

Per conv. a minute ago with Marcus, Christi Nicolay in the Regulatory Group 
just checked and Ontario Power Generation does not have a FERC marketing 
license.  That leaves them to buying US power only (both east & west OK).  
Please make this change immediately.

Thanks!


I'm working on Samantha's IMC Canada.  It was signed by faxed signatures 
yesterday and I am expecting the originally signed documents to come in by 
Federal Express today.

can you add the regularly scheduled Legal/Credit Meetings, and the Swap Group 
Meeting for my calendar for the year.  Thanks!We have received the above executed ISDA Master Agreements 
(Multicurrency-Cross Border) with the two referenced counterparties executed 
05/25/99, effective as of 11/16/98.  Copies will be distributed.

I have also received in the originally signed confirmations and will be 
sending them down to Laurel Adams.I sent the UBS Letter to the confirm desk like a week ago, I forget who to, 
maybe  Bernice, since I kinda consider it an audit letter.  My note said the 
confirm desk can sign off on the letter since they were only asking us to 
confirm trade information.

The Teeside Confirm, I spoke to our tax guys this morning and they said they 
were really busy yesterday and hadn't had a chance to look at it...I'll call 
them again.Will,

I usually send these directly to the customer unless you prefer otherwise, so 
I will also need an email address or telephone and fax number.  I also need 
to know whether you want a bilateral form of non-disclosure agreement or a 
one way form that protects Enron only.  In circumstances where we are certain 
Enron will be the only party providing confidential information we prefer to 
use that form.  Also, I need to know the nature of the confidential 
information you are discussing so we can protect the information being 
discussed.

I need two non-disclosure agreements before sharing our DocuLogic functional 
requirements document with an external consulting company with expertise in 
building document management systems.  Can you make these for me, or should I 
approach IT's contracts department?

Last time I had them made, Enron required (1) official name of company, (2) 
state of incorporation, (3) principal address of business, (4) name/title of 
their authorized signatory.  Is this still the case?

John
The Sabre NDA that you made revisions to has been passed on to me from
Gary Potter here at Sabre.  I have obtained comments back from our legal
department regarding changes that were made.  In the version you sent
back to us the supplement page and reference to it had been deleted. If
I can explain why we have structured our NDA's in this fashion.  If we
can get the basic NDA in place and agree on those terms, it is often
easier in the future to add a new supplement when ever the scope of the
conversations change.  This is helpful to save time in the future so
that other business units within Sabre do not have to negotiate terms
again.
I have made a few additional changes based on our attorneys request.
Please feel free to call me if needed, 817-931-4674.  If you accept the
changes made go ahead and sign the document and return it to me via fax
at 817-967-4756.
thanks

I think it may be possible that we have existing NDAs in place with the 
referenced counterparty.  The nature of our discussions that I am currently 
preparing an NDA for is the possible access to and use of a web-based 
transactions-support system for online and offline commodity trade (including 
derivative products).You're wearing me down, you're relentless!!!

At the request of Daniel Diamond, I am attaching our proposed form of 
Non-Disclosure Agreement.   If the enclosed meets with your approval, please 
execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will 
then have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions please 
call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or me at (713) 
853-3399.  We look forward to hearing from you.


With respect to your email below,  I am already working with Bob Bowen on 
assigning the various Aquila trades.

On Amoco, I will need to get a list similar to the one Bob prepared for me 
for Aquila, showing the exact trades being assigned, deal no., whether they 
are physical or financial, trade date, start date , end date, etc.  If you 
get with Bob he can show you what he prepared for me for Aquila.  Once I get 
that I can prepare the assignment.  I will also need the name and phone 
number for the Amoco person I should be sending this assignment to.  I don't 
know who will have that, the Confirm Desk, Settlements, or EOL?  Once I get 
all this I can prepare that assignment.

Susan,

We have several EOL deals (Amoco Energy, Aquila Energy) in which the 
Counterparty's Trader has done Financial deals through their entity that 
usually only does Physical deals.  Mark Taylor and others had decided that we 
couldn't simply agree to change the name of the Counterparty but would need 
to Assign such Transactions to the correct entity (BP Amoco, Aquila Risk 
Mgt).  Do you know if someone in Legal is involved with assigning these or 
can we draft something down here?

Thanks,
Joe

Just FYI... several deals came across on my invoice for Amoco Energy Trading 
Corporation, but should be BP Amoco Corporation (BA 03400).
The deal numbers as follows:

N54185.1
N54970.1
N54977.1
N55023.1
N56595.1
N57893.1
N59629.1

I changed the invoice to reflect BP Amoco Corporation and wanted to notify 
you of the change.  If you have any questions regarding the above,
please call me at x3-7598.

Thanks!

Those are negotiated changes.  The only was to tell what is a "Canadian" 
thing is by looking at the form.  It is color coded with different colors for 
different countries or other special legal issues.  I believe Canada is a 
purplely pink color in the form, the footnotes should tell you.

I never heard back from you.  You were going to look at my list of approved 
jurisdictions and see if you disagreed with any of my information.  I'll be 
out the rest of the week, but maybe when I get back we can chat again on the 
phone, and maybe pull Edmund in, because before Edmund got sick, we were 
pretty much in agreement on how he was supposed to respond about Americas 
countries and how I should respond about European countries.Strictly informational.  I need to know everytime we have a governmental 
entity, so since there was no note in the side that this was connected a 
governmental I had to research that.  I was sharing the information I 
gathered with you so as to save you some time in case you didn't already know 
this.  Obviously, you did.

Re:  Usinor SA:  that appears to be a London counterparty.  It should not be

		 Subject: 

Tana, the products listed below (as I understand) comprise the initial 
products for the EOL roll-out.  It is unusual that ECTRIC, rather than ENA, 
will be the Enron party, even with respect to transactions that will be 
confirmed out of the U.S.  This is something Mark and I (as well as tax and 
credit) have scrubbed at length and approved.


Enron principal counterparty for each: ECTRIC
Each product is a financially-settled swap (NO OPTIONS)

(1) Coffee swap -- NYBOT reference price (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(2) Coffee swap -- LIFFE reference price (executed by ECTRIC/EEFT from London)
(3) Coffee basis swap -- NYBOT/LIFFE spread (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(4) Sugar swap -- NYBOT reference price (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(5) Sugar swap -- LIFFE reference price (executed by ECTRIC/EEFT from London)
(6) Sugar basis swap -- NYBOT/LIFFE spread (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(7) Cocoa swap -- NYBOT reference price (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)
(8) Cocoa swap -- LIFFE reference price (executed by ECTRIC/EEFT from London)
(9) Cocoa basis swap -- NYBOT/LIFFE spread (executed by ECTRIC from Houston)

I will immediately look into whether there would be special restrictions for 
swaps on coffee, sugar and cocoa with respect to Australian, Singapore and 
Hong Kong counterparties (I think these are the three most likely non 
U.S./European jurisdictions at this point)

I got a call from National Bank of Canada and they said that we purchased the 
referenced company and what did we intend to do with the trade between NBC 
and Daishowa?  Anyone know anything about this?Attached are referenced lists.  Again, no approvals for European physical 
power products until further notice.


To confirm our conversation yesterday,  the referenced counterparty can only 
purchase power in the east. Ken Curry is following up with the woman from NBC on this.

Hey guys,

I'm in the process of getting authorized to access files in the O drive, and 
need to confirm which folders are ones that I would need.  The one labeled 
Legal seems appropriate.  Also, I understood from Alan that there is a folder 
with scanned in ISDA Masters that I need.   The thing of it is that I don't 
know what's in any of the folders, so it's hard to figure which ones I should 
get authorized for.

If you guys could help me identify which ones they are, that would be great.

Thanks,

Dear Tana Jones:

The New York Mercantile Exchange is excited and we want to tell you why.
NYMEX is about to launch enymexsm  and its prospects are invigorating.

Over-the-counter (OTC) participants will now be able to execute transactions
on the same platform as NYMEX futures.  The Exchange plans to use its proven
clearing infrastructure to introduce complete counter-party risk management,
and create net margining with Exchange futures markets by calculating a
consolidated clearing position.  Subsequent enymexsm functionality will also
provide an internet-based interface to the established Exchange futures
market by routing futures orders to the trading floor and the NYMEX ACCESSc
electronic trading system, depending on the session.

Attached please find information announcing the first slate of products to
be offered for listing on enymexsm .

Since we value your business as a forerunner in this industry, we are
enclosing for your review the sale registration form, which consists of the
enymexsm System User Agreement.  Please review, sign and return to Robert A.
Dagistino, Director of Customer Service, New York Mercantile Exchange, One
North End Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10282.  Any questions can be answered via
email at rdagistino@nymex.com or via telephone at 212-299-2429.

The signatory must be an executive officer or partner of the firm.  We are
also attaching two "click-on screens" that users will view when they first
log on to the system.

Please note that since the enymexsm products will be cleared you will also
need to obtain authorization from a clearing member for your account.

A NYMEX team, consisting of members of our Board, local traders and staff,
will be visiting each one of you in person.  They will discuss with you how
to utilize the benefits of NYMEX to achieve precision in many of your
customized transactions.

We look forward to receiving your registration and participation in what is
intended to be the premier, global exchange for forward trading and clearing
contracts focusing on energy and metals products.

Sincerely,

 <<...OLE_Obj...>>
Neal Wolkoff,
Executive Vice President

Another Division

Mark,

Global Counterparty wants me to approve this EOL counterparty which is a 
division.  My deal with the EOL team was that they would kick these 
counterparties back and try to get the legal incorporated entity as part of 
the name.  Global Counterparty is satisfied opening counterparties up as 
divisions and I am getting frustrated constantly fighting this battle.  Do 
you wish to intercede, or shall I give up and let counterparties be opened as 
divisions?  Do you want to call a meeting with Sam's boss to discuss 
divisions?  What to do?

FYI...

Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty

Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as 
such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link
to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure.

Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change

Hello,

Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent 
and child for our downstream systems.
GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the 
Tradename / Division name or Parent Name  - - not both simultaneously.
(Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the 
purpose of using a Tradename.

Best Rgds.

Tana,
 
Please review the process below:

With divisions,  EOL does request a new Password Application for the 
applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.  When the company is set up 
in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP 
ID.  Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to 
establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.

Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see.  

Thanks,
Stephanie

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."  
or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."  
or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".

Bill -

If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me 
like something needs to be changed.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the 
confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.  
Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the 
power to contract in their own names.  If the correct legal name is not in 
Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on 
it seriously compromising the contract itself.  That is the source of Tana's 
concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.  

My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer 
has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is 
that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer 
until they are correctly completed.

In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to 
transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application 
they are understandably upset and are now complaining.  I would appreciate it 
if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with 
changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.

FYI...

Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty 
System as a Division of Cargill, Inc.
Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as 
such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link
to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure.

Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change 
documentation from the Counterparty
in order to change this name.

Hello,

Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent 
and child for our downstream systems.
GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the 
Tradename / Division name or Parent Name  - - not both simultaneously.
(Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the 
purpose of using a Tradename.

Best Rgds.

Tana,
 
Please review the process below:

With divisions,  EOL does request a new Password Application for the 
applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.  When the company is set up 
in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP 
ID.  Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to

Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see.

To summarize and in response to our meeting last week:

1.   I am attaching the list of Non-Disclosure Agreements I maintain for the 
Enron Net Works Team and my proposed form for the EnronOffline Team.  Please 
let me know if this form meets with your approval or if there are any changes 
you would like.  This list will be circulated to the Project Offline Team 
Wednesday afternoon.  Mark, could you please provide me a list of the people 
you would like the list circulated to.

2.  All future requests for NDAs for the EnronOffline Team should be directed 
to me instead of Kay Young.  The request for the NDA should be sent to me by 
email and include the legal name of the company, the contact at the company 
and the company's address.  In addition, each request for an NDA for 
EnronOffline should be clearly indicated as a Project Offline NDA (since I 
prepare many other NDAs for Enron Net Works).  At the request of the 
dealmaker, I usually send the NDAs directly to the counterparty by email, so 
an email address should be included.  If you would like the NDA sent some 
other way, please let me know (hard copy sent by mail or fedex, fax, etc.).

3.  I will work with Travis (or other ENA lawyers, as necessary ) to 
circulate and revise any comments from counterparties.  I will then circulate 
the NDAs for signature.  When fully executed, the originals will be filed 
with Kay Young.  Please note that copies of ALL Network agreements should 
also be filed with Lisa Lees (the original should always be filed with her, 
except Confidentiality Agreements, which get filed with Kay Young).

4.  Kay Young will review my list to determine if there are any NDAs that she 
has prepared that should be added to the list.

If I have missed anything or if you have any comments or questions please 
call me at x33399.




I wanted to thank you and your team for getting this done so quickly.  I 
really appreciate it!----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 04/17/2001 09:12 AM -----

Tana - It has been some time since we have spoken/emailed/voice mailed ....  
How y'all doing? Things are good in Toronto now that winter is almost over.

Will you help me out with something?  I need to know if we are able to do a 
power swap under the ECT ISDA with National Bank of Canada.  I looked it up 
on the database and do not see any restrictions but I wanted to make sure.

See you in San Antonio.

Per my conversations with Bob Shults, Bob Bowen, Mark Taylor and Brant Reves, 
we are going to open Aquila Risk Management Corporation to trade weather 
under the EOL GTC's. I'm sorry about not turning this around sooner.  I thought I might be getting 
other comments from you.  If it meets with your approval, please sign it and 
return it via fax no. (713) 646-3490 and I will have it signed by Enron and 
return a copy to you by fax.

Bill,

I think you are about to become my new best friend!

We have another long standing counterparty we cannot get approved on 
EnronOnline because we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.  The 
Counterparty sent in a Password Application styled:  Koch Industries, Inc., 
acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  (Which also happens to 
be the same styling on the Master Swap Agreement we have in place with this 
Counterparty.)

They way I understand it, GCP has the two following Counterparties already 
set up:  (1) Koch Industries, Inc., and (2) Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.

The EnronOnline Team has been trained to never set up a company as a 
division, to always send the Password Application back to the Counterparty 
and try to get the Counerparty to resubmit the application with the legal 
incorporated name as part of the counterparty name, which they sucessfully 
did in this instance, but now we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.

Can you help us?!!!Can you help me with this?

Tana,

I have received the quote for the new files for your area.  The 5-drawer 
files are $682 each and the 2-drawers are $362 each for a total of $5,948 
(includes tax).  If you want me to proceed with the order, please send me an 
authorizing email.  Also, I still need to know how you would like the 
cabinets to be keyed: all alike, split by banks (by groups) or individually, 
or a combination of the last two options.  I can submit this purchase order 
now without this information, but will need that shortly.

I will be out of May 26-28, so if you have any questions, please contact Pat

Clem,

Attached is the resume of my dear friend, Carolyn Varela.  Carolyn started 
working at Liddell, Sapp, Zivley, Hill & LaBoon a few months before I did in 
1984 (while I left after 10 years for the greener pastures of Enron!).  
Before coming to Liddell, Sapp, Carolyn was a Corporate Paralegal at Texas 
Commerce Bank, one of the principal clients of Liddell, Sapp, and was a key 
contact for handling the TCB relationship over the years along with the 
primary lawyer she worked for, Mr. LaBoon, who maintained the TCB 
relationship for the law firm.

Carolyn is a kind, cheerful person, a hard worker and a pleasure to be 
around.  I was in the Municipal Bond Group and she was in the Corporate 
Group, but we frequently backed each other up (as well as the Real Estate and 
Lending teams) on closings, proofreading documents, large filings, etc.  I 
think she would be a great asset to your team and Enron.

Bernice, here is the information on WAPA counterparties.  I will send you a 
specific request on each of these entities when I can get to it.  In the 
meantime, can you please change the name for WAPA phonenix to WAPA-Desert 
Southwest Region so that we do not have duplicate records and tell EOL about 
the changes.  Let me know if you have questions.  EOL is waiting for me to 
populate a contract for the new record that you set up for desert SW region 
and we need to get this resolved.

I work for Enron and am trying to determine (1) which of your offices are
members of the Western Systems Power Pool and (2) what the current names
are for your entitites.  I need the full legal name for each.  Below is a
list of the names I have in my database of names.  Can you please confirm
if these are current and/or if any names have been changed.  The WSPP
Administrator sent me the attachment, which indicates the Phoenix office
houses "Lower Colorado".  I'm not sure if this is accurate.  Thank you very
much for your help.

WAPA-Salt Lake City

Tana,

As per conversation, attached are two forms of letter that we have used in 
the past when requesting legal advise from local counsel.  The long form is 
the letter that Alan and Sara worked on with Allen & Overy back in 1996.  The 
short form is the letter that Mike Robison has used when dealing directly 
with local counsel requesting advise in connection with physical trading 
matters.  I hope this is helpful.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks.

  Would you like to set up this meeting or would you like me to?  I would like 
to get this Koch thing resolved ASAP, so I think the sooner, the better.  
From Legal's side, both Mary Cook and I need to be included, I spoke to 
Credit and both Walter Guidroz and Tom Moran would like to be included, 
probably Joe Hunter from the Confirm Desk as well, and anyone else you're 
aware of.  Let me know how you think we should proceed.With respect to this new counterparty for EnronOnline (correct name to 
follow):

Sam Schott advises us that we are limited to 90 characters for a counterparty 
name in GCP.  The correct legal name for this counterparty is longer than 90 
characters.  I discussed this with Marcus Nettelton, our power lawyer, and if 
the following scenario meets with the approval of the financial and physical 
power Confirmation Desks we think the best way to treat this matter is to set 
the counterparty up in GCP as follows and then add this counterparty to the 
special handling list so all confirmations, physical and financial, offline 
and online, go out with the LEGAL NAME, not with the GCP NAME.

LEGAL NAME OF COUNTERPARTY:  Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as 
authorized agent for and on behalf of IES Utilities Inc., Interstate Power 
Company, and Wisconsin Power and Light Company

SUGGESTED NAME FOR GCP:   Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent 
for three listed utilities

Joe and Kim, is this workable for the Confirm Desks?  If you can let me and 
Sam know then Sam can get them set us.

Subject: Access Rights for Credit Instruments

Hi guys,

We're launching (new) Bankruptcy Swaps and brand new Credit Default Swaps on 
Monday.

As usual there are 'special' rules that surround these products.  I'm in the 
process of setting all the Guest Profiles to reflect these rules but wanted 
to pass the information on for PAs that we receive.  
Houston- can you please forward to your appropriate Legal teams?  if they 
have specific questions regarding these products or the legal framework 
surrounding them, please refer them to Denis O'Connell, the London lawyer who 
has worked on the GTCs etc.

 Credit Default Swaps
You have to be a special kind of counterparty to trade these products (please 
see Denis for required documentation needed) and they are taking a very 
targeted marketing approach to their customers.  Because of this (for now) 
only US and UK counterparties can have View access.

Bankruptcy Swaps - we used to have 5 product types for Bankruptcy Swaps (Nor, 
UK, US, SE, FI) but these have been consolidated under new terms into 1 
(Global) Bankruptcy Swap.  The other 5 product types will be moved to 
Inactive as they have never traded.

Also, a new Web Filter will be used to pull in the new Bankruptcy and Credit 
Default Swaps - Global Credit Instruments.  Please advise any customers to 
use this web filter to view the products (provided they are in a country who 
has been approved to View/Trade them).  

Please reference the table and the list below for information on Guest Access 
for the different Countries.

If you have any questions at all, please give us a call.

Subject: Access Rights

Hi Denis,

I'm trying to figure out what the 'Rules' are for the Bankruptcy and Credit 
Default Swaps go as far as Guest Access to EnronOnline.

Based upon your profile spreadsheet from Wednesday, here's what it looks 
like.  Please let me know if there are any differences as I will be 
communicating these rules to the London and Houston Product Control Groups.  

Also, can you please tell me which countries Could and Could Not trade the 
two products (with proper certification in place of course).  As discussed 
earlier this week, I believe you will be communicating this to the Houston 
Legal team directly... so I'm just asking as an fyi.

Thanks,
Lara

In the table below - 'N' means the country can Not View the products, 'R' 
means the country can View the products




Also can you please tell me what the rules are for the following countries 
for both Bankruptcy and CDS:
Per Denis O'Connell, none of the below Countries can have VIEW access to 
either CDS or Bankruptcy Swaps

line.  I have some concerns.  I will let you know this a.m.

Subject: Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent

With respect to this new counterparty for EnronOnline (correct name to 
follow):

Sam Schott advises us that we are limited to 90 characters for a counterparty 
name in GCP.  The correct legal name for this counterparty is longer than 90 
characters.  I discussed this with Marcus Nettelton, our power lawyer, and if 
the following scenario meets with the approval of the financial and physical 
power Confirmation Desks we think the best way to treat this matter is to set 
the counterparty up in GCP as follows and then add this counterparty to the 
special handling list so all confirmations, physical and financial, offline 
and online, go out with the LEGAL NAME, not with the GCP NAME.

LEGAL NAME OF COUNTERPARTY:  Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as 
authorized agent for and on behalf of IES Utilities Inc., Interstate Power 
Company, and Wisconsin Power and Light Company

SUGGESTED NAME FOR GCP:   Alliant Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent 
for three listed utilities

Joe and Kim, is this workable for the Confirm Desks?  If you can let me and 
Sam know then Sam can get them set us.

Thanks for your help!


Our only concerns are that we have the appropriate tax forms signed and 
in-house before they start trading.   If they trade U.S. products from the UK 
we will have to get the appropriate U.S. tax forms in, and Edmund can address 
any UK tax forms they might need on UK products traded from the UK.At Wendi's request, I have submitted a request to get you both edit access to 
the Financial Trading Agreement Database.  In the meantime, below is the icon 
that will allow you to have view access to everything but the comments.  I 
will let you know when your edit access is approved (at which time you will 
be able to input changes/comments, as well as be able to see comments).

link -->Things have come up w/Mark & Sara and there is a clear indication from their 
front that we need to retain the green files.  Maybe we need to discuss this 
with the whole group...?

Just a note so we are all on the same page... I just had a superseded and 
replaced Enron Corp. guaranty that the counterparty returned to me, and I 
asked Clem to verify what he wanted me to do with the old original guaranty, 
and he said to send it back to him and he would have Cindy mark it 
"canceled".I havent heard anything back from them, Mark, have you?

Bill,

I think you are about to become my new best friend!

We have another long standing counterparty we cannot get approved on 
EnronOnline because we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.  The 
Counterparty sent in a Password Application styled:  Koch Industries, Inc., 
acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  (Which also happens to 
be the same styling on the Master Swap Agreement we have in place with this 
Counterparty.)

They way I understand it, GCP has the two following Counterparties already 
set up:  (1) Koch Industries, Inc., and (2) Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.

The EnronOnline Team has been trained to never set up a company as a 
division, to always send the Password Application back to the Counterparty 
and try to get the Counerparty to resubmit the application with the legal 
incorporated name as part of the counterparty name, which they sucessfully 
did in this instance, but now we cannot get the counterparty set up in GCP.

Can you help us?!!!Are you ok with this (they would not be listing, as agent for 3 listed 
utilities)?

		 Subject: Counterparty Legal Names, Division, DBA's, Agency's

As a follow-up to a recent discussion with Tana Jones concerning counterparty 
divisions, a meeting is being setup for Monday, April 30, from 1:00 PM thru 
3:00 PM, to discuss counterparty naming conventions for Divisions, DBA's,  
Agencies and the requirements of downstream systems.  A few examples of 
encountered naming variations are as follows:
 1) Koch Industries versus Koch Industries, a division of Koch Corporation
 2)  Doing Business As, Koch Industries versus Koch Industries Inc. 
 3) Hess Energy Trading (UK) Limited versus Hess Energy Trading (UK) Limited, 
as agent for Hess Energy Trading LLC
 4) Legal structure change i.e. a counterparty changes from a corporation to 
LLC 

A few of the questions or issues surrounding counterparty name variations are 
as follows:
 1) Counterparties that are shared between Enron companies 
 2) Duplicate counterparties 
 3) Confirmations needs
 4) Credit roll-up
 5) Contract needs
 6) Netting Issues
 
I have attempted to describe the most common of situations encountered 
involving naming conventions but if any further consideration or 
clarification is needed in regard to this matter, please feel free to add to 
the above examples/ issues list or telephone me at ext.39249.

Julissa Marron, ext. 5836 will send out the meeting invitation with the room

Have Nevada Power or Sierra Resources a presence in Canada? Unclear as to why 
they are seeking to trade physical power in Canada, having regard to their 
service area of Nevada. Otherwise Ditto Credit.

Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company shouldn't be a problem for 
weather transactions.  The Master Agreement we have in place with them is an 
ISDA Local Currency.  The only thing we need to cover is in the confirmation 
adding the trade option rep for weather, since weather wasn't covered way 
back then.  Otherwise, they are already approved for all products for online 
trading.  Since the master is a Local Currency form, we might run into some 
problems if they wanted to trade non-u.s based products, or use any other 
currency other than U.S. $$.  If either of those issues come up, let me know.Rob, can I get the four deal nos. so I can get the information I need from 
the confirm desk to prepare the termination letters?  I will contact Steve 
South to get the name & phone nos. of the contacts at the counterparty I can 
send the letters to.

Hi Tana -  

We need your assistance in preparing termination letters for the transactions 
listed on the attached spreadsheet and described as follows:

On Friday, April 20, 2001, four transactions occurred on EnronOnline that 
were in error.  One transaction was with Coral Energy Holding L.P. and three 
transactions were with Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.  As mutually agreed 
to by both the Enron commercial team and the respective counterparties, it 
was decided that each of the four transactions would not be confirmed and 
should be terminated.  

The exact specifics are detailed as follows:

? The transactions occurred due to an inadvertent entry in the actual 
production system of EnronOnline by a Product Control Group member, Melba 
Lozano.  Melba activated a product assuming that she was in the EnronOnline 
test system of EnronOnline.  

? The product transacted upon is normally managed by Frank Ermis.  However, 
in his absence on Friday, the product was managed by Matt Lenhart.

? Steve South, trader on the West Desk, called and notified both Morgan and 
Coral that the product had been posted in error.  All parties agreed that the 
transactions were not reflective of the normal pricing.  As a result they 
further agreed that transaction confirmations would not be necessary and that 
the deals would be "killed" on all sides.  (For reference of any telephone 
tapes that may need to be pulled, the conversations with the counterparties 
occurred around 2:00 pm.)

? No confirmations were generated as a result of the killing of the 
transactions in TAGG.

? I spoke with Mike Grigsby on Monday (April 23, 2001) and advised him that 
termination letters may be required by Legal.  He responded that he had no 
problem with that.

Tana, please advise if additional information is required to complete the 
termination letters or if another course of action is warranted.

Thank you,

Rob Cass

I really don't know.  Maybe the icon, which is just a shortcut to the 
database, won't work because of outlook.  I haven't had this problem with any 
other people on outlook before.  You might want to talk to your computer 
person.  He can probably find the database the long way.  It is just a misc.

As an FYI, from time to time I will be preparing NDAs for the Networks team 
headed by Mark S. Palmer working with Travis on "Project Offline".  Project 
Offline has evolved a form of NDA and added a non-solicitation clause and a 
residuals clause.  I wanted you to be familiar with the form in case Travis 
is not here, you,as are my backup lawyer for the Networks team.  The form, 
like all my Networks forms is kept in my "Confidentiality Agreements" 
subdirectory under "Forms" (in case you ever need it and I'm not around).

The nonsolicitation clause is one way (rest is bilateral)  so if it is 
included you have to remember to fill in its blanks.  (You probably would

Using Enron's back office services to process their energy deal transactions.


This has nothing to do with EnronOnline.  Please do not include EnronOnline

Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company shouldn't be a problem for 
weather transactions.  The Master Agreement we have in place with them is an 
ISDA Local Currency.  The only thing we need to cover is in the confirmation 
adding the trade option rep for weather, since weather wasn't covered way 
back then.  Otherwise, they are already approved for all products for online 
trading.  Since the master is a Local Currency form, we might run into some 
problems if they wanted to trade non-u.s based products, or use any other 
currency other than U.S. $$.  If either of those issues come up, let me know.
Quick Draw...!!!

To all,

The new Enron Center Garage has opened and if those of you that have accepted 
spaces at the new garage would please return your Met and Allen Center 
parking cards ASAP,so that we can back fill your spaces with others on the 
waiting list.  The Allen Center and Met cards will be deactivated 
immediately. Please contact Parking and Transportation if you have any 
questions.  You may hand your old card to the security guard at the garage 
exit through the end of this week.

Thank you very much for your cooperation.

We've picked up two more diners for La Fogata in San Antonio, Andrea Calo and 
Yao Apasu.  Can you call back the restaurant and switch our reservation to 
two tables of 8 people, instead of one table of 14.  I think a table of 8 
will be more manageable than a table of 16.  Thanks!As we discussed, attached is my "Cheat Sheet" which I use to guide me when 
approving non-US counterparties that come in through EnronOnline via Houston 
Credit.  London Legal and I try to coordinate our responses but I cannot 
speak for them and the standards they may apply to approving counterparties 
to trade online.  They also frequently deal with different countries than 
us.  You may want to speak to Justin Boyd.  Generally, with respect to most 
physical trading, except power trading, there are no legal restrictions to 
trading.  Most of the restrictions in this list are with respect to financial 
products.  Physical bandwidth has generally not done much legal due diligence 
outside of the US and the UK and bandwidth is therefore not open to non US 
and UK counterparties.

With physical power, generally, in most countries they require some sort of 
power marketing license so I look to the power lawyers to guide me.

As I also mentioned, for Japan or Australian based counterparties I wait for 
David Minns or Jane McBride to advise me.

Comments:


Per the request of Lucy Ortiz, I have reviewed the current list of weather 
counterparties we are trading with, and have targeted four counterparties 
that we have open for trading weather offline that  I am now going to open 
for online trading.

1.  El Paso Energy Marketing Marketing Company, name change as of 12/1/99 to  
El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company - previously approved for all products, 
except weather, now add approved for weather also.  Non-ISDA Master Agreement 
in place.
2.  Madison Gas and Electric Company - previously not approved for any 
financial products, now approving for all financial products.  No Master 
Agreement in place.  Credit, we need to pursue this financial master.
3. Swiss Re Financial Products Corp. - we previously did not approve this 
counterparty for any financial trading - now open for weather financial 
trading only.   No Master Agreement currently in place; however, we are 
getting close on the negotiation of this ISDA Master.
4.  Vitol N.A. - we previously had them approved for all products, but 
weather, open them up for weather, as well.  Non-ISDA Master Agreement in 
place.  Steve Douglas, counterparty is a Swiss corporation and have never 
sent us their tax forms.----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 04/27/2001 11:50 AM -----

Sent for Bob Walker 


A group of us have decided to gather for dinner on the Wednesday night before 
the legal conference and wish to extend an invitation for you to join us for 
good food and fellowship and maybe a few drinks.  We have reservations for 
8:00 pm at Delores Del Rio, which is a small Italian restaurant on the 
river.  They have excellent food and live Jazz music.  Very small and quaint 
little place and away from the crush of the party places on the river.

I will need to give a final head count to the restaurant on Wednesday.  If 
you can join us, or know of anyone who would like to, please let me know and 
I will get directions, or we can all walk over from the hotel.  It is a very 
short walk.

Please let me know if you can attend.

Thanks,

Bob.


Thanks, you're the best!

Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is 
the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating 
EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.  The trades should continue to be 
initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any 
unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual 
circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk 
for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same 
procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.

Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer 
and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination 
Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.

The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be 
terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.

If you have any questions, please call.

		 Subject: Project Offline NDAs

To summarize and in response to our meeting last week:

1.   I am attaching the list of Non-Disclosure Agreements I maintain for the 
Enron Net Works Team and my proposed form for the EnronOffline Team.  Please 
let me know if this form meets with your approval or if there are any changes 
you would like.  This list will be circulated to the Project Offline Team 
Wednesday afternoon.  Mark, could you please provide me a list of the people 
you would like the list circulated to.

2.  All future requests for NDAs for the EnronOffline Team should be directed 
to me instead of Kay Young.  The request for the NDA should be sent to me by 
email and include the legal name of the company, the contact at the company 
and the company's address.  In addition, each request for an NDA for 
EnronOffline should be clearly indicated as a Project Offline NDA (since I 
prepare many other NDAs for Enron Net Works).  At the request of the 
dealmaker, I usually send the NDAs directly to the counterparty by email, so 
an email address should be included.  If you would like the NDA sent some 
other way, please let me know (hard copy sent by mail or fedex, fax, etc.).

3.  I will work with Travis (or other ENA lawyers, as necessary ) to 
circulate and revise any comments from counterparties.  I will then circulate 
the NDAs for signature.  When fully executed, the originals will be filed 
with Kay Young.  Please note that copies of ALL Network agreements should 
also be filed with Lisa Lees (the original should always be filed with her, 
except Confidentiality Agreements, which get filed with Kay Young).

4.  Kay Young will review my list to determine if there are any NDAs that she 
has prepared that should be added to the list.

If I have missed anything or if you have any comments or questions please 
call me at x33399.

ISO9.com and ANSI Establish Reselling Agreement for the ISO 9000:2000 
Standards 
New York, NY and Oakland, CA, December 11, 2000 - ISO9.com and the American 
National Standards Institute (ANSI) have announced an agreement regarding 
U.S. distribution of the ISO 9000 series of quality management system 
standards, including the soon to be published ISO 9001:2000 and ISO 9004:2000 
standards. ISO9.com sells electronic versions of the Standards on the 
Internet at http://store.iso9.com. The new version of ISO 9000 will be 
available on December 15.

"Distribution of the ISO 9000 standards is an important step for our 
organization," said Glenn Kohner, Founder and CTO of ISO9.com. "Customers on 
the Internet expect instant delivery of information. Users on our site are 
learning about Internet ISO 9000. It's only natural that they would want 
access to the actual Standards."

There are two ways to procure the ISO 9000 standards from ISO9.com. The 
Standards, which a company is required to own to be in compliance, will be 
offered both independently and bundled with the ISO9.com application. With 
the integrated version, companies will be able to view the Standard alongside 
their QMS, in a seamless format. 
"ISO9.com is one of ANSI's more unique value added resellers in that it has 
actually integrated the ISO 9001:2000 standard into its application," 
commented Bob Feghali, ANSI vice president of business development and chief 
information officer. "We are committed to fast action in the delivery of the 
new ISO 9000 revisions; partnering with ISO9.com will greatly assist ANSI in 
our ability to insure a widespread distribution of the complete ISO 9000 
family of standards."

Sergio Mazza, past President of ANSI, Appointed to Board of Directors

Oakland, CA. November 21, 2000 - ISO9.com, the world's first Application

both international standards and high technology to help the Company achieve 
its corporate vision.

Hornbacher, CEO of ISO9.com. "He has tremendous depth of experience in our 
highly specialized field, and is uniquely qualified to help us bring our 
online vision for the quality and standards industries to fruition."

service businesses and his six years as the president of ANSI will both be 
instrumental in his new role with ISO9.com. His corporate career and 
leadership experience ranges from his activity as a software entrepreneur to 
his service as president of Memorex North America and Memorex Computer 
Supplies Worldwide. Mr. Mazza has recently been working as an advisor to

I left a voicemail for the trader to provide me with the phone number and 
name of the person who he spoke to but he never returned my calls.  I guess, 
if someone from Joe's group could please prepare the two termination letters 
and get them signed...

Subject: Request Termination Agreements for 4 EnronOnline Transactions


Hi Tana -  

We need your assistance in preparing termination letters for the transactions 
listed on the attached spreadsheet and described as follows:

On Friday, April 20, 2001, four transactions occurred on EnronOnline that 
were in error.  One transaction was with Coral Energy Holding L.P. and three 
transactions were with Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc.  As mutually agreed 
to by both the Enron commercial team and the respective counterparties, it 
was decided that each of the four transactions would not be confirmed and 
should be terminated.  

The exact specifics are detailed as follows:

? The transactions occurred due to an inadvertent entry in the actual 
production system of EnronOnline by a Product Control Group member, Melba 
Lozano.  Melba activated a product assuming that she was in the EnronOnline 
test system of EnronOnline.  

? The product transacted upon is normally managed by Frank Ermis.  However, 
in his absence on Friday, the product was managed by Matt Lenhart.

? Steve South, trader on the West Desk, called and notified both Morgan and 
Coral that the product had been posted in error.  All parties agreed that the 
transactions were not reflective of the normal pricing.  As a result they 
further agreed that transaction confirmations would not be necessary and that 
the deals would be "killed" on all sides.  (For reference of any telephone 
tapes that may need to be pulled, the conversations with the counterparties 
occurred around 2:00 pm.)

? No confirmations were generated as a result of the killing of the 
transactions in TAGG.

? I spoke with Mike Grigsby on Monday (April 23, 2001) and advised him that 
termination letters may be required by Legal.  He responded that he had no 
problem with that.

Tana, please advise if additional information is required to complete the 
termination letters or if another course of action is warranted.

Thank you,

Rob Cass

Subject: Legal Question

Susan,

We have notified Bank of Montreal of our intentions not to verbally confirm 
any deals in which we have done through a broker or through Enron Online.  
BOM has therefore sent us a letter which confirms this for their auditing 
purposes which they would like for us to sign.  We want to make sure Legal is 
OK with us signing something like this before we send it back to them.  Let 
me know if you want to see the Letter.

Thanks,
joe

Just a note to always remember to check "ERMS", we are frequently amending or 
updating and replacing old ERMS masters with ISDAs and ERMS should always be 
added as a company when you prepare the legal credit list.  Thanks.It won't let me open the document.  Can you ressend it?

We will need to catch a cab to get to La Fogata which is located at 2427 
Vance Jackson Road in San Antonio.  Our dinner reservations are for 7:00 pm, 
so I suggest we all meet in the hotel lobby at 6:30 and catch group cabs 
together.  Dress is casual.  The phone number for the restaurant is 
210-340-1337, in case you get lost in a wild cab ride or something similar 
(this will have special meaning to certain swap group members!).  If you 
haven't RSVP'd back to me, please do so, so I can get an accurate head count 
for tomorrow.

See you in San Antonio.----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 05/02/2001 08:56 AM -----

I'm not sure who the best person to address this issue to is. Please let me 
know if this is something you can answer:

Canada has inadvertently created two products, one 29-day (Feb) and one  
31-day (Mar) in the > 1 Month < 1 Year category, and wants to move them to 
the < 1 Month category. As you can see below, the GTC's are the same for 
either category. Can you check and make sure that the Master Agreements don't 
prohibit this?

Looks like I was confused. There is only one Canadian GTC. The split was done 
solely to accomodate the different Master Agreements.

I don't have a problem moving 31 day deals into the <1 month category, but 
you should check with Contracts first, to confirm that the <31 day Canadian 
Master Agreements do not prohibit this.

TO:
All NYMEX and COMEX Members and Member Firms

! Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved changes =
to=20
NYMEX and COMEX Clearing Association rules, which have also been filed with=
=20
the CFTC, that expand the types of non-cash assets that customers may depos=
it=20
with their Clearing Members for margin purposes.

! Specifically, the rule changes, which are attached below, permit the use =
of=20
letters of credit, certain securities and deliverable warehouse receipts by=
=20
customers to meet their margin requirements. The rule changes provide for=
=20
consistent treatment in the use of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX=20
Divisions.

! Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit=20
(LCs) now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions.

! Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule=20
changes allow letters of credit to be used on a =01&pass-through=018 basis =
on both=20
divisions.  In other words, Clearing Members on both divisions will be able=
=20
to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by customers. =
It=20
should be noted that while securities and deliverable warehouse receipts, a=
s=20
detailed below, may be used by customers for margin purposes, such assets m=
ay=20
not be used on a pass-through basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin=
=20
obligations with the clearinghouse.

! Securities. Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing=20
Members certain types of securities as margin. The types of acceptable=20
securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some tim=
e=20
on the COMEX Division.  Specifically, the rule changes will permit customer=
s=20
to deposit the following types of securities as margin with Clearing Member=
s=20
on either division:

securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the=
=20
American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter=
=20
market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve=
=20
Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances;=
=20
can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any o=
ne=20
issuer; and will be valued for purposes of margin at 75% of their market=20
value.

! Deliverable Warehouse Receipts. On both divisions, deliverable warehouse=
=20
receipts for any of the commodities traded on the Exchange will be accepted=
=20
as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at =
no=20
more than 75% of the value of the commodity.

! Effective Date. These rule changes will go into effect on June 1, 2001.

! Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit.  A follow-up Notice to=
=20
Clearing Members will be distributed shortly that will include a form=20
prepared by NYMEX that will serve as the authorized  uniform form for=20
irrevocable letters of credit for use on a pass-through basis at the Exchan=
ge=20
.

		 Subject: Another two guests?

We have had an overwhelmingly favorable response to the May19 Church 
Gourmet.  I have already added one extra party to accomodate the additional 
guests.  We now have 48 participants and need a place at the table for 2 or 4 
of them.  Is there any way that Tana or Kleta could add a couple of chairs to 
their tables to squeeze in two more?  Poor Lisa Kennedy has found herself 
with a potential for 16 guests in her townhouse and is not sure where they 
will all fit.  

If Henry and I could move to Tana's house and Kleta could pick up Dan and 
Andrea Goodwin, this would solve the problem.

This is a great problem to have - more than half of the participants in the 
dinner are new members at CTK - I hope you can help out.

ALG

P.S.  We can loan you extra chairs if necessary..

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its=20
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up f=
or=20

=20
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for whi=
ch=20

=20
rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the provisions o=
f=20
Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred=
=20
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and=
=20
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system. =
=20
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing=20
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B) Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1) Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once=

(b) accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c) confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as=20
practicable; and

2. Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the executing=

=20
the broker=01,s obligations under these rules.  The executing broker remain=
s=20

3.  Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member =20
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order=
=20
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the=20
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:

Marilyn,

Do we have some documentation from the City that shows the City of Long Beach 
with a "Inc." at the end of their name?  I have never seen a city with an 
Inc. at the end of their name before, that is a corporate thing, not a 
municipal thing...

Pursuant to the documentation the counterparty provided when they entered 
into the power EEI, and at the direction of Marcus Nettelton, a lawyer in the 
power group, the counterparty name for the Port of Oakland should set up in 
GCP as follows:

The City of Oakland, a municipal corporation acting by and through its Board 
of Port Commissioners

GCP, if you could please redo the counterparty name, and Stephanie, if you 
could please resubmit the PA to match the counterparty name, then we can get 
this one done...

Tana,

Per Kathy Moore in EOL, FPL traded under the wrong entity on May 3.  Can you 
draft an Assignment Agreement, moving the below trade from FPL Energy Power 
Marketing, Inc. to Florida Power & Light Company?

EOL #1207089
Enron Deal #V76777.1

Thanks,

Per my voicemail, attached is the assignment of the FPL trade.  If you could 
please attach as Exhibit A, the specifics of the trade and then fax the 
assignment to the counterparty.  When the counterparty faxes the signed 
Assignment back we will have to have it initialled by a lawyer since it is a 
contract, and send it up to me and I will get someone to sign it.

Regards,
Tom Moran
3-3017I look forward to having you all as guests for an evening of Cajun cooking at 
my home on Saturday, May 19 at 7:00 pm.  Some of us (I won't name names!) are 
hoping we might even have enough time to play a wicked game of African Uno!

Below is the list of the individuals attending the dinner at my home, and 
attached below are the recipes for the evening.  I will provide beer, wine 
and soft drinks.  In addition, I will make a big pot of white rice to go with 
the Red Beans & Rice, & Shrimp Etouffe.

Please let me know as soon as possible which recipe you would prefer to 
prepare.

Laura Johnson (1)
Charles and Janice Thompson (2)
John Hagood (1)
Ann Hutson (1)
Henry and Alicia Goodrow (2)
Beryl and Ray Mack (2)
Tana Jones (1)

The directions to my house are as follows:

1.  Take 59 to the Greenbriar exit (like you are going to Church)
2.  Make a right on Greenbriar
3.  Quickly get into the left lane because you will have to make the first 
left possible onto a street called Milford
4.  Then, make a left onto Shepherd (you need to go back one street in the 
opposite direction)
5.  The first right will be Banks Street (it is the street right next to the 
59 freeway)
6.  On Banks, go past the first stop sign, I will be the 3 or 4th house on 
the left, a taupe colored, ivy covered cottage, 1920 Banks
7.  My phone number is (713) 529-1038


Matt,

The only people that can have full view and edit capability are Legal and 
Credit (for legal/client confidentiality purposes).  Attached is the icon, 
which is just a shortcut link to the database and you can send that link to 
any Enron employee and they will have view access to all the information in 
the database except the legal and credit comments.  I will make a request to 
add the legal and credit people to get edit capability.  I think Denis 
O'Connell already had edit access, send him the link and let me know if he 
has edit access.  (you can just copy this link and add it to emails to 
people, however, I'm a little afraid it might not work from London, because 
it is just a shortcut, if it doesn't, you might need your computer people to 
create a shortcut link for y'all, let me know).

Matt,

Back office should have access to insert confirmations comments.  Yumi Takei 
needs to be on the back office list (not the lawyers list) - Gail Hill and 
Carol Findlay also need to be added; you should also ask ask them whether any 
other back office staff need access to add coments.

Credit need to have edit access for inserting credit comments. 

Add Denis O'Connell and Paul Johnson to the lawyers list.

Note that I am the only person in London with delete capability.

Thanks, Edmund

Subject: SWAPS DATABASE ACCESS

Hi Tana-as discussed, here are the names of folks who need access to the swap 
agreements database (please forgive me if some included already have access.)
 Janet Wood, Michael Slade , Ian Brungs, Robert Quick, Justin Boyd, Michael 
Schuh, Martin Rosell, Yumi Takei, Mark Elliot,   Rahaul Saxena, Adam Duguid, 
Paul Simons, Marcus Von Bock

Read only access- Debbie Nicolls, William Morely , Chris Sloan, Diana 
Higgins, Hamish Skutt, Lindsay Edmunds, Rod Nelson, Anna Reich, Paul Maley, 
Minna Tapponen, Oliver Harrison.

Thanks for arranging and if you need any more info please let me know.


Ed- Is there anyone else who you think we should include?






Matt,

Justin Boyd, Mark Elliott and Paul Simons already had edit access to the 
database.  From London, Nicola Beales, Robert Quick, Tracy Foy  & Robert 
McGrory (is he in Legal?) already have edit access (also yourself & Edmund).

Are All the other People you have requesting edit access in Legal?

On read access, Rod Nelson from Credit already has Edit access from his days 
in London.  You can send all those other people the Link (if it works) and 
they should be able to get in.  If they are in Credit we will want them to 
have edit access because they can read the comments so they can see more 
detail about the negotiation.  And hopefully, input their comments about 
their negotiation to keep Legal apprised (we can always hope!).

		 Subject: May 19 Church Gourmet Cajun Dinner

I look forward to having you all as guests for an evening of Cajun cooking at 
my home on Saturday, May 19 at 7:00 pm.  Some of us (I won't name names!) are 
hoping we might even have enough time to play a wicked game of African Uno!

Below is the list of the individuals attending the dinner at my home, and 
attached below are the recipes for the evening.  I will provide beer, wine 
and soft drinks.  In addition, I will make a big pot of white rice to go with 
the Red Beans & Rice, & Shrimp Etouffe.

Please let me know as soon as possible which recipe you would prefer to 
prepare.

Laura Johnson (1)
Charles and Janice Thompson (2)
John Hagood (1)
Ann Hutson (1)
Henry and Alicia Goodrow (2)
Beryl and Ray Mack (2)
Tana Jones (1)

The directions to my house are as follows:

1.  Take 59 to the Greenbriar exit (like you are going to Church)
2.  Make a right on Greenbriar
3.  Quickly get into the left lane because you will have to make the first 
left possible onto a street called Milford
4.  Then, make a left onto Shepherd (you need to go back one street in the 
opposite direction)
5.  The first right will be Banks Street (it is the street right next to the 
59 freeway)
6.  On Banks, go past the first stop sign, I will be the 3 or 4th house on 
the left, a taupe colored, ivy covered cottage, 1920 Banks
7.  My phone number is (713) 529-1038



Please find attached list.
No time out for Tana.

Tana,

Hi.  Can I duck out?  I need to work most Saturdays, so I probably shouldn't
be on the roster for Church Gormet for a while.
Sorry--it's my loss entirely.

What is African Uno?  That sounds like fun.

all financial products under with the existing El Paso Energy Marketing 
Company (now known as El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas Company) Master Agreement

we assigned to El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas, L.P, pursuant to an Assignment of 
Agreements dated as of 12/1/99.

Confirmation Desk:  with respect to weather confirmations, they should 
continue to follow the existing format of the El Paso Energy Marketing

Stacy Dickson about which contracts to use (EL Paso, Sonat or GTC).

EMERGING PRODUCTS.  Approved for all products.

Trading Sessions


Notice # 01-162
May 11, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Reminder and Clarification on NYMEX Division Post-Close Trading Sessions

DATE:  May 11, 2001
===========================================================
Reminder
Changes will be going into effect today, Friday, May 11, 2001 for the End of 
Week post-close trading sessions and also, beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, 
for the Monday-Thursday post-close trading sessions. The trading range for 
all of these sessions will be expanded by adding the following ticks above 
(below) the daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that 
this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price 
fluctuation limits then in effect):
Crude Oil  20 ticks
Heating Oil   50 ticks
Unleaded Gas   50 ticks
Natural Gas  50 ticks

 Clarification
Previously, the trading range for the Monday-Thursday sessions was the 
closing range for the applicable contract month. Exchange staff interpreted 
the rule to provide that if a contract month did not trade during the close, 
there would be no closing range and thus it would not be permissible to trade 
that contract month during the post-close.  Now, as noted above, the 
post-close session trading range on any day of the week will be an expanded 
version of the daily range. Therefore, the Exchange is issuing the following 
clarifications as to the contract months that can be traded during a 
post-close session (on any day of the week):

1. Only the first twelve listed contract months are eligible for trading in 
the post-close.

2. If a particular contract month does not trade during the RTH session, it 
may not be traded during the post-close.

3. It is not necessary for a contract month to trade during the close in 
order to be traded in the post-close as long as it has traded during the RTH 
session.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George 
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob 
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212) 299-2207.

Ian,

The confidentiality provisions contained in this agreement do not allow us to 
provide the agreement to affiliates.  I will need some direction from the 
counterparty either via email or phone before I can send you a copy of the 
agreement.  Sorry...

Hello Tana,

I was wondering if you could provide me with a copy of the ISDA in place with 
Alcoa Inc. today. It would be greatly appreciated if you could send this 
document either by email,  or to me by fax at 0207 783 1171.  Sorry about the 
rush on this.

Thanks in advance, 

Ian
I had a rush approval on this list, so while you were out having a baby 
(well, actually Louise was doing all the hard work!), I called Leslie at home 
at Elizabeth's direction because I had to get Sierra Pacific Holding Company 
approved.  We are currently purchasing power from them and Ed Sacks said we 
just gotten an EEI in place with them so Leslie approved them for both the 
bid and offer on west power (even tho Credit is going to open them up for 
purchases only).

No one has approved any other lists while you were out, so I have been 
patiently been waiting your return...sniff...sniff...

3-3017Can you please put this counterparty in profile manager for me.  We had a 
really old ERMS Master that restricted the types of financial products they 
could trade under it, and I want to take a look and see what we've got them 
approved for.  They should be able to trade any financial products now.  
Thanks!On the ISDA replacement front, just a reminder that we want to put Morgan 
Stanley Capital Group at the forefront, we have an old Energy Price Swap 
Agreement in place with them, and then there's always our favorite, the old 
AIG "Master Master", now with Sempra, that raises a whole host of other 
issues...you were going to talk to Bill about that one...

Do you want me to put them on the list for the Legal/Credit meeting as a 
reminder?As of this week EnronOnline has just started offering US/Canadian Dollar 
Swaps Online.  As part of my review in determining whether a counterparty can 
transact these products online I look at the Financial Trading Agreement 
Database to see if there are any restrictions indicated, check the master 
swap agreement, and I am also looking at any Board Resolutions we might have 
received when we got the master agreement executed. 

What I am finding is that in the old days when we asked for resolutions 
evidencing the authority to enter into the master agreement/derivative 
transactions frequently the resolutions do not allow the counterparies to 
enter into currency transactions.  Since transacting these currency 
transactions with our energy customers is a new area of business for us I 
just wanted us all to be mindful to check these old resolutions and not to 
rely solely on the "Restrictions" contained in Lotus Notes.

FYI, following-up on this matter, after discussing the matter with their 
counsel and confronted with a $3.5MM lawsuit, Lakeside acknowledged the deal

Subject: Litigation Counsel Approval - Lakeside Packers

We have a counterparty (Lakeside Packers) who refuses to perform to a 5 year 
fixed for floating power swap which commenced Jan. 01 and is C$2.5MM 
(US$1.7MM) in the money to us and booked (we would take a hit to earnings by 
that amount to unwind the deal).  Unfortunately, without the involvement of 
Legal, the deal was executed without paper, but on the basis that it was 
subject to our standard ISDA documentation.  The Confirm was sent out on that 
basis but not executed by the counterparty.  There was some agreement on 
guarantee support, but as this was less clear to get the underlying deal put 
in place, with the approval of Credit, we gave up the requirement for the 
guarantee in our subsequent discussions and demand letter.

We want to pursue the matter by commencing litigation.

Lakeside is traditionally represented by Blakes.

My suggestion would be to use the Duncan McCachen firm, a litigation boutique 
who we have used in the past (CIBC litigation).  Mike McCachen has a good 
understanding of the trading business for a litigation lawyer.  
Alternatively, I would suggest Clarke Hunter of Macleod Dixon who is 
currently representing us on the NGX litigation and who also has a good 
understanding of out trading business.  Mike is a little more aggressive than 
Clarke, to my preference.

We would like to proceed as soon as possible as our demand letter expired 
last week, and our calls this morning were not dealt with satisfactorily.

Peter.






I think we should stick with the standard so people can cook it at home if 
they like it.

I usually use more bananas than that recipe calls for; also, no fruit
liquor.  Usually turns out well.  Is this approach OK or do you love the
standard?

! Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved changes =
to=20
NYMEX and COMEX Clearing Association rules, which have also been filed with=
=20
the CFTC, that expand the types of non-cash assets that customers may depos=
it=20
with their Clearing Members for margin purposes.

! Specifically, the rule changes, which are attached below, permit the use =
of=20
letters of credit, certain securities and deliverable warehouse receipts by=
=20
customers to meet their margin requirements. The rule changes provide for=
=20
consistent treatment in the use of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX=20
Divisions.

! Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit=20
(LCs) now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions.

! Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule=20
changes allow letters of credit to be used on a =01&pass-through=018 basis =
on both=20
divisions.  In other words, Clearing Members on both divisions will be able=
=20
to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by customers. =

should be noted that while securities and deliverable warehouse receipts, a=
s=20
detailed below, may be used by customers for margin purposes, such assets m=
ay=20
not be used on a pass-through basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin=
=20
obligations with the clearinghouse.

! Securities. Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing=20
Members certain types of securities as margin. The types of acceptable=20
securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some tim=
e=20
on the COMEX Division.  Specifically, the rule changes will permit customer=
s=20
to deposit the following types of securities as margin with Clearing Member=

on either division:

securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the=
=20
American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter=
=20
market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve=
=20
Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances;=
=20
can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any o=
ne=20
issuer; and will be valued for purposes of margin at 75% of their market=20
value.

! Deliverable Warehouse Receipts. On both divisions, deliverable warehouse=
=20
receipts for any of the commodities traded on the Exchange will be accepted=
=20
as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at =
no=20
more than 75% of the value of the commodity.

! Effective Date. These rule changes will go into effect on June 1, 2001.

! Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit.  A follow-up Notice to=

Anna's information is not completed and I bet her cost center is different 
from yours (company the same?).I've got everyone's access submitted except Martin Rosell and Anna Reich and 
Oliver Harrison whose company codes and cost centers I will need.  Justin, 
Mark Illiott, Robert Quick and Paul Simons already had edit access into the 
database and does your assistant Nicola Beales who should be checking that 
when she approves counterparties for EnronOnline (although I don't think the 
UK agreement are currently up-to-date, although they need to be for 
EnronOnline, it will save her a lot of time).

I'm a little worried about your Credit people making changes.  When you 
approve Credit people, warn them that they are should not make any changes 
except to Credit comments.

Edmund will need to go in and add your Legal and Credit people to the 
Database Keywords as only he should have access to add Keywords.  You might 
want to get him started on that because you have a lot of people to add.  
It's taken me quite a bit of time get all these approvals done!On or about 5/2/01we opened the above counterparty to transact Canadian/US 
Currency Swaps on EnronOnline (which they cannot transact under the old 
Master Energy Price Swap Agreement, they would have to transact udner the 
GTC).  After discussing this counterparty w/Sara Shackleton, an attorney in 
the swap group, it appears that Sara has been talking to Morgan Stanley and 
Morgan Stanley does all its interest rate & currency business out of Morgan 
Stanley Capital Services, Inc.  We can keep Morgan Stanley Capital Group open 
for currency swaps, but if they don't trade currency swaps out of that 
company we'll know why.  Sara is already working on an ISDA Master for 
Capital Services for Gary Hickerson's group.----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 05/15/2001 02:46 PM -----

Linda -

I have reviewed the below agreement that Stephanie forwarded.  It is 
acceptable.  

Please have Mr. Cosey sign the necessary originals and have them forwarded to 
me or to Tana Jones at Enron.  Our address is 1400 Smith Street, Houston, 
Texas 77002.  We will ensure countersignature by Enron.

If you should need anything, please call me or Tana (at 713-853-3399).

		 Subject: Enron Non-Disclosure Agreement


Mark,
Per our discussion last Friday, I am attaching a revised NDA which has your
proposed changes (not revision-marked) as well as the changes we propose to
make in additon to those (which are revision-marked).  The only
revision-marked changes are in the second paragraph regarding written and
oral disclosures.  After speaking with Linda Milfred (an attorney I work
with), we thought the change we made regarding oral disclosures is more
appropriate than what you and I discussed last week.  I will be out of the
office for the rest of the week, so:

1.   If the changes are acceptable, please call my assistant Maria Wheeler
and she can accept the changes and prepare originals for Jackson Cosey's
signature; or

2.   If the changes are not acceptable, please either call Linda Milfred at
(404) 676-6631 to discuss or leave a message for me and I will call you
back at the first of next week.

Regards,

Stephanie Allred

(See attached file: Enron NDA.DOC)
 - Enron NDA.DOC

So I don't forget when you get back, I just spoke to John Allario, and we 
either need to amend or draft a new NDA for General Motors to deal with some 
new business approaches Net Works is making with them.  We'll need to 
possible add in 3 other Enron companies, so when you get back give me a call 
and I'll bring my notes around and we can discuss this.It depends on the sophistication of the counterparty.  I think Tembec is 
fairly sophisticated based on the resolutions from them I have already seen.  
For a counterparty that isn't, we have sample board resolutions we can send 
them, or we even prepare them for some counterparties because sometimes they 
can't even figure out how to fill in the blanks.

Tana - thank you for your messages.  I will advise Jan and Randy that in 
order for Tembec to do gas transactions under this ISDA, they weill need to 
provide us with a board resolution authorizing the same.  Do counterparties'  
typically prepare their own resolutions or do we provide them with a 
precedent?

Thanks

Andrea,

I had Mark Greenberg, an attorney that works on EOL matters, review Green 
Mountain's form of CA and he much prefers ours.  What he suggested is that 
you send the counteparty back our form and say something to the effect that 
EnronOnline has a standard form of Confidentiality Agreement we prefer to 
execute our form.  If the form meets with their approval we're golden.  If 
they don't like it have them call me (and I'll just refer them to Mark!).

Attached is our preferred form.

Attached is the referenced list.  Again, no physical European power approval 
for US counterparty until further notice.  The El Paso Merchang Energy-Gas, 
L.P. was responded to by email already yesterday.
An NDA for EOL, this time it would protect the counterparty so we can receive 
copies of their financial statements.

5-3-011.ZIPI wanted to forward you directions to my house for dinner this Saturday.  
Alicia left me a voicemail and also suggested you bring your friend 
Kimberly.  Please feel free to do so, the more, the merrier!  I hope you will 
be able to make it.  Everyone has responded yes, except John Hagood.

I look forward to having you all as guests for an evening of Cajun cooking at 
my home on Saturday, May 19 at 7:00 pm.  Some of us (I won't name names!) are 
hoping we might even have enough time to play a wicked game of African Uno!

Below is the list of the individuals attending the dinner at my home, and 
attached below are the recipes for the evening.  I will provide beer, wine 
and soft drinks.  In addition, I will make a big pot of white rice to go with 
the Red Beans & Rice, & Shrimp Etouffe.

Please let me know as soon as possible which recipe you would prefer to 
prepare.

Laura Johnson (1)
Charles and Janice Thompson (2)
John Hagood (1)
Ann Hutson (1)
Henry and Alicia Goodrow (2)
Beryl and Ray Mack (2)
Tana Jones (1)

The directions to my house are as follows:

1.  Take 59 to the Greenbriar exit (like you are going to Church)
2.  Make a right on Greenbriar
3.  Quickly get into the left lane because you will have to make the first 
left possible onto a street called Milford
4.  Then, make a left onto Shepherd (you need to go back one street in the 
opposite direction)
5.  The first right will be Banks Street (it is the street right next to the 
59 freeway)
6.  On Banks, go past the first stop sign, I will be the 3 or 4th house on 
the left, a taupe colored, ivy covered cottage, 1920 Banks
7.  My phone number is (713) 529-1038



They should be approved today.  They were on last night's list.

Tom/Tana-

Genesis ventures migrated last night. The counterparty needs to be retouched 
on the 5 European products (read only) and also US Recycled ONP Physical 
(trade).  

I would appreciate it if you could revisit this counterparty when you get a 
chance.

Per the attached memo from Mary Cook, an attorney in the Swap Group, and our 
meeting with members of Global Counterparty where we discussed problems with 
utilities of cities not being clearly identified, may I suggest the we rename 
GPP 98029, Norwich Public Utilities, something like, The City of Norwich, 
Connecticut?(which state?), by and through its Public Utilities Department.  
(The city utilities are at the bottom of the list.)

Stephanie, we will also need them to resubmit their PA.  Cheryl, we may need 
to confirm how we want to set this counterparty up before Stephanie send out 
the PA.

Miss Tana,

Is there a chance you might like to try to get together this weekend?  I
thought I would check with you first and then see if Phyllis is available.

I have a hair appointment at 8 a.m. on Saturday.  We could do breakfast at
10, or whatever...

Let me know.

Patti

Good!!  If you want to get Hollie, Lucinda, etc., to come, please feel free
to do so.  Is there any special place you want to go???

I have been thinking about you as well.  I have your bicycle and will
return
it to you when you are ready for it.  I can bring it on Saturday.  Will it
fit in your car?  If not, I can drop it by after breakfast.  Might need to
come by anyway to see what else you have done to it.

I will call Carol, too, if you don't care.

How goes you choosing a date for NYMEX ACCESS training?  I faxed you the 
schedule.  The Houston guys are going February 4, from 10:00 - 2:00.  The 
earlier you reserve, the better chance you have of getting the date you 
want...Another request for the EnronOnline Team.  Any conflicts?Attached is "Annex B.doc" which we use to prepare Annex B which contains the 
credit provisions we attach to a Confirmation when such is requested for 
omnibus financial confirmations.  About mid-way through the US Annex B is 
about 4 selections of collateral annexes depending on whether the credit is 
one-way or two-way and whether the collateral requested is letters of credit 
only or letters of credit and cash.  Following that is form of letter of 
credit.  We have an Annex B form for US counterparties and Canadian 
counterparties.  I have attached both.   The law in Canada currently does not 
favor taking cash in Canada and WE DO NOT TAKE CASH (this obviously is quite 
problematic for us!).  Our current advice from Canadian counsel is that Cash 
must be perfected in a way similar to filing a UCC.  The Canadian and US 
lawyers are re-reviewing this situation and I will let you know when/if this 
advice changes.

Kate -

Thanks for the comments to the NDA.  All are acceptable except -

Paragraph 5 - Deletion of arbitration.

Paragraph 9 - Change from two years to three years.

Please advise if Loudcloud can live with arbitration and 2 years.  If not, 
please advise why not.

Tana-

We have a few counterparties that have been in the work queue for a while.  
When you get a chance, would you mind taking a look at the counterparties 
listed below:

Cascades Inc.
Capital Paper Recycling, Inc.
Storm Mountain Publishing Company
Jeffrey Acquisition Group
Nippon Paper Industries Co., Ltd.
NLK Consultants Inc.
Plateau Forest Products, Inc.
Southwest Paper Stock Inc.

We also need to get together and go through the work queue again for a few 
old counterparties I still see on the list.  Give me a call when you get a 
chance and we can run through that.

Thanks Tana!

Hi Mark,

Just checking on the status of the revised NDA you were going to forward with 
the
arbitration clause included and the 3 year confidentiality period.  We are 
prepared to
sign and fax the NDA back as soon as we receive it.  Thanks!

What's the status on this registration?  The customer is eager to receive 
transaction status (calls fairly often so I would call that "eager").

Thanks,

Re: Pacific Forest Resources

Unless this is another company or they have changed their name subsequent to 
the execution of the ISDA Master in 1998, we have an ISDA Master in place 
with this counterparty and have a copy of their Articles of Incorporation in 
the file, and there is no "Inc." at the end of this company's name.  If you 
would like me to send you a company of the company's Articles of 
Incorporation I will be happy to do so.

Attached please find the referenced list.  Some additional comments are as 
follows:

1.  City of Redding-no change from our previous approvals.
2.  Cajun Electric Power-no west coast power (caiso or firm).  It can only 
trade east coast power and Enron can only purchase from Cajun via EOL.

As usual, no European power until further notice.

Sure, just use me as as reference for getting a job.  Let me know when you 
come into town.

Hi

I just found your e-mail and decided to see if you actually read
them.  Actually I also have a request.  I want to put your name down
as having talked to you about a job at ENRON.  This is for my
unemployment benefits.  They theoretically say they can call contacts
but they never have.  Anyway, anyone I talk to about whether a job
might be available in their company is appropriate.  I will put down
that there is nothing available for me, as I assume would be the
case.  It looks like I will get the job at Landmark.  I will probably
be coming down for training soon.  I'll keep you posted on when.

Hi Tana,

We did have it set up in the system without "Inc." but I got a request from 
the settlements group to add "Inc." to the name.  I personally verified it 
with the counterparty, and changed the record in GCP.  Lexis-Nexis shows that 
it was incorporated in California in 1984 as Pacific Forest Resources, Inc.  
Yes, please fax the articles to 713 646 5797, so I can get this clarified 
once and for all.  

Thanks,

I do not agree and I am discussing this with Justin Boyd in London before I 
(or Justin) responds to this Counterparty.  Joe, can you take a look at their

Hi,

I have received a call from Miriam in Glencore re EOL transactions.  Her

(from Houston) of the deal being dealt which we are subject to in London and 
she would like to see this from ENA.  Also, when Glencore agreed to trade EOL 
transactions they stipulated that English law be used for all transactions, 
presuming these would be the same from ENA.  She has tried to call but only 
gets voice mail, could you please contact her to discuss these and any other 
issues she has with EOL.

Tel: 44 20 7412 3190

Justin,

Per the email below, before we respond to Glencore we just wanted to make 
sure that you haven't made any agreements with Glencore with respect to 
choice of law for the online trades that would subject them to UK law.

I don't want to talk to them without checking with you first since this is 
one of the true counterparties that we are trading with on both sides of the 
Atlantic.

By the way, I heard you had some really good news.  I'm so happy for you!

which fax failed on Friday( I've signed and sent them this morning.). 

Also, considering the time difference, ENA may fax out a deal on T+1 after 
Europe
has gone home, so the counterparty will not see the confirm till the morning 
of T+2.  

Glencore should also get themselves set up with back office user access to 
EOL, so they
can peruse their deals while awaiting the confirm.  

I have also sent word to our legal department asking them to look into 
Glencore's
governing law status.  

I'll convey this to Miriam when I speak with her.
Thanks,
Diane

Hi,

I have received a call from Miriam in Glencore re EOL transactions.  Her 
concerned are that she does not receive the confirmations within 24 Hours 
(from Houston) of the deal being dealt which we are subject to in London and 
she would like to see this from ENA.  Also, when Glencore agreed to trade EOL 
transactions they stipulated that English law be used for all transactions, 
presuming these would be the same from ENA.  She has tried to call but only 
gets voice mail, could you please contact her to discuss these and any other 
issues she has with EOL.

Tel: 44 20 7412 3190

Regards,

Debbie

Just something I noted as I got in to approve Edison Mission.  West power was 
also in the queue for approval.  We had previously had them approved for all 
power, and Credit had shut them down for power because Credit has been 
worried about their financial condition ala PG&E, but now is willing to open 
them up for all power.  I thought it was OK to open them up for all power 
since we had them open for all power before, but I just wanted to run it by 
you just in case...

Hi Tana

Thanks for the note.....!

I am looking for the original letter we signed with Glencore, but from my 
recollection, all we said to Gencore was that the choice of law under any 
master or other trading agreement between Enron and Glencore was unaffected 
by the choice of English law under the UK PA or ETA.  This of course is not 
quite the same as Glencore's view below!

Justin,

Per the email below, before we respond to Glencore we just wanted to make 
sure that you haven't made any agreements with Glencore with respect to 
choice of law for the online trades that would subject them to UK law.

I don't want to talk to them without checking with you first since this is 
one of the true counterparties that we are trading with on both sides of the 
Atlantic.

By the way, I heard you had some really good news.  I'm so happy for you!

Above company has approached us re an ISDA with them, they have also told us

for some time.

**************

Laurie/Nony,

I wonder if you can find out for me from the data base, what the status is 
with Mitsui Corp. ISDAs re all Enron companies?  

***************

Alan,

Mitsui Corp has hinted that it doesn't want to have separate ISDAs with 
separate Enron entities.  What is Enron's usual approach to this I wonder.  
Seems to me that from the customer's perspective, this makes sense.  I wonder 
what sort of internal issues this raises though.

**********************

Thanks all.

Jane

I told Paul Radous, the Credit guy that you had already said that these guys 
could not trade physical power because they do not have a power marketing 
license.  It perhaps might be possible for them to purchase US power only.  
If they want to enter into power transactions he is going to need to get you 
a name and phone number of someone at Engage that you can talk to to get 
evidence of their power marketing license.

why we wouldn't open them up for derivatives trading.  I told him that we

The agreement would be entered into by The Chase Manhattan Bank.  It is
expected that Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York will merge with and
into The Chase Manhattan Bank in October.  (Their respective holding
companies have already merged and operate under the name J.P. Morgan Chase
& Co.)  Chase's address is 270 Park Avenue, NY NY 10017.As you requested, attached please find a copy of the referenced NDA.

I have 98% chance of complete cure!!!!!!  They are not going to take any 
lymph nodes at this time.  The surgeon said it didn't matter whether it was 
over my lymph nodes or not.  My surgery is outpatient on June 19th.  It was a 
"Clark's grade 2" out of a possible 5.  They are going to take more out of 
the one on my stomach also to make sure there are clean margins.  They took 
another mole off my arm but of course don't think it is a worry!  
Per our conversation, it appears that the two companies are going to merge in 
October?  Looking at Lotus Notes, I don't think we could pick two bigger dogs 
of masters to have in place.  I don't think we want either master to be the 
survivor master.  With Chase we have an old 1987 Interest Rate and Currency 
Exchange Agreement and with Morgan we have a Master Energy Price Swap 
Agreement.  Yuk, yuk.  If I had my druthers I say, LET'S START OVER.  I know 
it's far reaching, but maybe we could make it our goal to have this master

Why did we change the name for the Board of Municipal Utilities of Sikeston, 
Mo.?  That is the way the counterparty's financial statement reads as well as 
how the name is set up on their website?  I also spoke to their lawyer and he 
said that is how they transact.

    Mark,

    Thanks for the response.  Apparently the meeting is tomorrow, and we have
missed the FedEx deadline for today.  Shall I fax the signed NDA to you so 
that
the meeting can go forward, and FedEx 2 originals to you for formal signature
processing?

Dear Legal Lady's

I would like to further reinstate my status of favorite Credit Person, I know 
as of late my status had been slipping and I must confess I have no one to 
blame but myself.  I want you to know that after a lot of deep thought and 
pondering of my potential status downgrade, I have resolved myself to pull 
from deep inside and work to maintain my status.  Although my mates in credit 
have provided some strong competition to remove me from favorite credit 
status, I am here to tell you that I am committed 150% to remain as your 
favorite credit person!!!!!

Yours Truly,
Russell


Now, that being said, my commitment is demonstrated by the submittance of the 
Sempra Energy Solutions Credit Worksheet.



Thanks again,
Russell

713-853-3017Whilst speaking to Koch about the Koch Hydrocarbons/Industries trades, they 
asked if they could get ISDA Masters in place with two other Koch entities we 
are currently trading with.  The two companies are:

Koch Petroleum Group L.P., Credit Contact at Koch is Arnold Lenz at (316) 
828-8479

Koch Refining International Pte Ltd. a Singapore company, Credit Contact is 
in Singapore and can be reached at  65 835 20 27 (I don't know if Houston 
Credit or London Credit wants to handle this, I looked in the Master Swap 
Agreement database and I noticed that London sent them a draft in 1999).

The Legal contact at Koch is in my database.  It is a paralegal there, Pam 
Reinking at (316) 828-4783.----- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 06/01/2001 08:30 AM -----

Notice # 01-186
June 1, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division and COMEX Division Clearing Members

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of Amendments on Use of Letters of Credit, Certain Securitie=
s=20
and Deliverable Warehouse Receipts as Margin  for NYMEX and COMEX Transacti=
ons

DATE:
June 1, 2001
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

1. Implementation of Rule Amendments. As previously announced in Notice to=
=20
Members #01-147 (May 4, 2001), this Notice is to remind NYMEX and COMEX=20
Clearing Members of rule amendments that become effective today, June 1,=20
2001, that expand the types of non-cash assets that customers may deposit=
=20
with their Clearing Members for margin purposes.

2. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit. Clearing Members are=
=20
further advised that a form has been prepared by the Exchange that will ser=
ve=20
as the authorized  uniform form for irrevocable letters of credit for use o=
n=20
a pass-through basis at the Exchange.  This form may be obtained from the=
=20
Exchange=01,s Clearing Department.

3. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit: Specification of Joint=
=20
Beneficiary. The Pass-Through Letter of Credit differs from the Standard=20
Letter of Credit in that the Pass-Through Letter of Credit provides for Joi=
nt=20
Beneficiaries.  In this regard, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be used =
as=20
margin on the NYMEX Division should specify NYMEX as one of the Joint=20
Beneficiaries.  By comparison, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be used a=
s=20
margin on the COMEX Division should specify the COMEX Clearing Association =
as=20
one of the Joint Beneficiaries.

4. Restriction on Issuers of Letters of Credit. Please note that, under =20
applicable NYMEX and COMEX rules, a Clearing Member that is a bank subsidia=
ry=20
or is an affiliate of a bank may not deposit with the applicable Clearing=
=20
House a letter of credit issued or confirmed by such bank, bank parent or=
=20
affiliate bank.




As to the actual rule amendments, which are attached below, these rule=20
changes permit the use of letters of credit, certain securities and=20
deliverable warehouse receipts by customers to meet their margin=20
requirements. The rule changes provide for consistent treatment in the use =
of=20
such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions.

Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit (LCs=
)=20
now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions.

Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule=20
changes allow letters of credit to be used on a "pass-through" basis on bot=
h=20
divisions.  In other words, Clearing Members on both divisions will be able=
=20
to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by customers. =
It=20
should be noted that while securities and deliverable warehouse receipts, a=
s=20
detailed below, may be used by customers for margin purposes, such assets m=
ay=20
not be used on a pass-through basis by a Clearing Member to meet its margin=
=20
obligations with the clearinghouse.

Securities. Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing=20
Members certain types of securities as margin. The types of acceptable=20
securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some tim=
e=20
on the COMEX Division.  Specifically, the rule changes will permit customer=
s=20
to deposit the following types of securities as margin with Clearing Member=
s=20
on either division:

securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the=
=20
American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter=
=20
market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve=
=20
Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances;=
=20
can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any o=
ne=20
issuer; and will be valued for purposes of margin at 75% of their market=20
value.

Deliverable Warehouse Receipts. On both divisions, deliverable warehouse=20
receipts for any of the commodities traded on the Exchange will be accepted=
=20
as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at =
no=20
more than 75% of the value of the commodity.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard=20
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)=
=20
299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section,=20
NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Charles Bebel, Vice=20
President, Clearing Department, at (212) 299-2130.


AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 4.01 ("CUSTOMER'S MARGINS"), NYMEX RULE 9.05=20
("MARGINS") AND TO COMEX CLEARING ASSOCIATION RULE 48 ("DEPOSIT OF SECURITI=
ES=20
AND LETTERS OF CREDIT AS ORIGINAL MARGIN")

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

Rule 4.01. CUSTOMER'S MARGINS

(A) Initial margin at least equal to the level set for customers shall be=
=20
required of all customers. In no case shall a customer's initial margin be=
=20
less than a specified amount per contract, or a specified percentage of the=
=20
market value at which any commodity is bought or sold, such customer's marg=
in=20
to be determined and announced by the Board of Directors or its designee.

 (B) Once the required initial margin has been deposited for each individua=
l=20
transaction, such trade and such margin shall, for the purposes of this rul=
e,=20
lose their individual identity and be commingled with all other trades and=
=20
margins in the same commodity for the same customer account.

 (C) When the margin (Net Liquidating Value plus Non-Cash Deposits) in a=20
customer's account declines below the maintenance margin requirement=20
applicable to the open positions carried in such account, the Member Firm=
=20
carrying said account is required to collect (call) from the customer such=
=20
funds, which when deposited, will restore it to the then prevailing initial=
=20
margin requirement.

 (D) A Member Firm shall not accept orders for new trades on behalf of an=
=20
undermargined customer account other than those which reduce its initial=20
margin requirement unless such Member Firm has been given assurances by sai=
d=20
customer that funds sufficient to restore the account to its then prevailin=
g=20
initial margin requirement are forthcoming and will be received in a=20
reasonable amount of time not to exceed one business day for Floor Members=
=20
and three business days for all other customers.

(E)(1) A Member Firm may accept deposits from its customers in one or more =
of=20
the following forms as margin to cover open NYMEX Division positions:

 (a) United States Currency; or any currency freely convertible to United=
=20
States currency; provided that if foreign currency is deposited, its value=
=20
shall be calculated so that at the current rate of exchange the U.S. dollar=
=20
equivalent of the foreign currency satisfies the customer's margin obligati=
on.

 (b) securities issued by the Department of the Treasury of the United Stat=
es=20
maturing within ten (10) years of the date of the deposit and guaranteed as=
=20
to principal and interest by the United States Government. Such securities=
=20

This Notice is a reminder regarding certain rule changes and related policy=
=20
guidelines that will go into effect on June 1, 2001 for the NYMEX Division.=
 =20
The rule changes going into effect on June 1, 2001 on the NYMEX Division=20
allow shares of certain money market mutual funds to be acceptable for=20
purposes of original margin deposits.

Corresponding rule changes for the COMEX Division  have also been approved =
by=20
the NYMEX Board of Directors and filed with the CFTC; the changes for the=
=20
COMEX Division will be implemented at a later date.

 Rule Amendments
The amendments generally require that in order to be used for such purpose,=
 a=20
money market fund must be approved by the NYMEX Board and also must comply=
=20
with CFTC Regulation o 1.25.  For purposes of original margin, the Exchange=
=01,s=20
Clearing House will value such money market fund shares at 95% of their=20
market value.  In addition, a Clearing Member=01,s participation in any app=
roved=20
fund or any group of approved funds offered by the same issuer shall be=20
limited to the greater of $250,000 or 25% of the Clearing Member=01,s total=
=20
original margin obligations. Finally, no more than 25% of the total assets =
of=20
an approved money market mutual fund may be used to meet original margin=20
obligations at the Exchange.

Exchange Policy on Money Market Funds
The NYMEX Board of Directors also recently adopted three additional=20
guidelines that will be applicable to such funds. First, until further noti=
ce=20
from the Exchange, the Board has determined to limit the number of money=20
market funds available for this purpose to ten. Second, the Board will=20
require that henceforth each fund applying for such status must have a=20
minimum value of $5 billion.  Finally, each fund further must provide for=
=20
same day payment if notification is made by 3:00 p.m. on that day.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard=20
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)=
=20
299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section,=20
NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Joseph Sanguedolce,=20
Director, Financial Surveillance Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at=

Regards,
Wendi LeBrocq
3-3835Debbie Brackett and I met this week and reviewed the various Koch Hydrocarbon 
Company Divisions and have developed the following game plan to resolve the 
division issue with respect to this counterparty:

The following entities exist in GCP:

1.  Koch Hydrocarbon Co. (GCP #36680):  We would like this entity to remain 
OPEN and to be renamed "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch 
Hydrocarbon Company Division". 
2.  Koch Hydrocarbon Company (GCP #57853):  We would like all future trading 
with this entity SUSPENDED.  There appears to be one trade under this entity 
and this trade should me moved to GCP 36680.
3.  Koch Hydrocarbons Inc. (GCP #26197):  We would like all future trading 
with this entity SUSPENDED.  There appear to be no trades under this entity.

With respect to the current financial trading being done by Koch Industries, 
Inc. (GCP #126) (not under a master agreement), I spoke to the Legal 
Department at Koch and we will be entering into a side letter agreement with 
Koch that will put all financial trades done by Koch Industries, Inc. under 
the existing ISDA Master Agreement we have with Koch Industries, Inc. acting 
through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division.  I will let you all know when 
such side letter agreement has been executed.

As soon as GCP #36680 has been renamed we can re-submit them to EnronOnline 
and open them up for trading.I have submitted the security requests to get the three of you access to the 
"Other Agreements" subdirectory of the Financial Agreement Database.  That 
approval usually takes about a day, as soon as it comes through I'll let you 
know.  You will of course, still need to solve how to get into the directory 
with Mike Neves.  Let me know when you can get in.

This Notice is a reminder regarding certain rule changes and related policy=

guidelines that will go into effect on June 1, 2001 for the NYMEX Division.=
 =20
The rule changes going into effect on June 1, 2001 on the NYMEX Division=20
allow shares of certain money market mutual funds to be acceptable for=20

Corresponding rule changes for the COMEX Division  have also been approved =
by=20
the NYMEX Board of Directors and filed with the CFTC; the changes for the=

COMEX Division will be implemented at a later date.

 Rule Amendments
The amendments generally require that in order to be used for such purpose,=
 a=20
money market fund must be approved by the NYMEX Board and also must comply=
=20
with CFTC Regulation o 1.25.  For purposes of original margin, the Exchange=

of=20
an approved money market mutual fund may be used to meet original margin=20
obligations at the Exchange.

Exchange Policy on Money Market Funds
The NYMEX Board of Directors also recently adopted three additional=20
guidelines that will be applicable to such funds. First, until further noti=
ce=20
from the Exchange, the Board has determined to limit the number of money=20
market funds available for this purpose to ten. Second, the Board will=20
require that henceforth each fund applying for such status must have a=20
minimum value of $5 billion.  Finally, each fund further must provide for=
=20
same day payment if notification is made by 3:00 p.m. on that day.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard=20

JDP MOU


Mark,

Can you please review the changes made by Susan Chang at Microsoft to the SQL 
2000 SP1 JDP MOU for our Unify application.  Bob Ward is out of the office 
until June 4th, and this application is going into production on June 11th.  
We need to ensure the MOU is finalized and signed prior to going into 
production so that we can receive the appropriate support from Microsoft when 
we go live.

If you need to contact Susan her telephone number is 425-703-6394.  Her email 
is schang@microsoft.com.

Thanks for your immediate attention to this matter,
Corinna Bolender

Bob and Corinna,
Here are the versions of the MOU your lawyer will need to review.  As
expected, some of the items just did not make the bar to warrant a
change.  Specifically:
an actual date for the released product will not go on the MOU.
Customers who particpate in the JDP have a high degree of touch and
disclosure with MS.  Although we are glad to discuss dates and they draw
near with the customer we do not promise anything from the beginning
(though this hardly matters now considering the date).
The line in #4 that was cut and pasted to #17 has been placed back in
#4.  This is due to the placement of the topic in #4.  The rest of #17,
specifically stating that there is NO COST TO THE CUSTOMER has been left
in on #17, and I'll probably incorporate this for future use.  It is a
good addition.
#10 on Microsoft's section has been removed.  It is clearly rednundant
and not necessary.  We already say there is absolutely no cost to the
customer.

If this is agreeable (I have included the red lined version, so your
lawyers can review), the final version with those changes have also been
included.  Please print, sign and return.

Thanks!
JamMo!

I would like to permanently modify our MOU to the following for our
Joint Development Programs.  It is redlined, so you can review the exact
changes.  This is actually from the customer, but I like what they
changed and added, I just want to be certain that it's not going to come

Bob and Corinna,
Here are the versions of the MOU your lawyer will need to review.  As
expected, some of the items just did not make the bar to warrant a
change.  Specifically:
an actual date for the released product will not go on the MOU.
Customers who particpate in the JDP have a high degree of touch and
disclosure with MS.  Although we are glad to discuss dates and they draw
near with the customer we do not promise anything from the beginning
(though this hardly matters now considering the date).
The line in #4 that was cut and pasted to #17 has been placed back in
#4.  This is due to the placement of the topic in #4.  The rest of #17,
specifically stating that there is NO COST TO THE CUSTOMER has been left
in on #17, and I'll probably incorporate this for future use.  It is a
good addition.
#10 on Microsoft's section has been removed.  It is clearly rednundant
and not necessary.  We already say there is absolutely no cost to the
customer.

If this is agreeable (I have included the red lined version, so your
lawyers can review), the final version with those changes have also been
included.  Please print, sign and return.

Thanks!
JamMo!

Susan,
I would like to permanently modify our MOU to the following for our
Joint Development Programs.  It is redlined, so you can review the exact
changes.  This is actually from the customer, but I like what they
changed and added, I just want to be certain that it's not going to come
back and bite me later.  Roughly 4 or 5 sentenced.
Thanks for you help!

A little forward movement trying to get the Global Counterparty not to set up 
counterparties under division or trade names.  If the counterparties insist 
on doing so, we have been trying to get them to add the legal name as part of 
the counterparty's name in GCP.   For non-swap team members, you may want to 
forward this email on to your groups as well.

		 Subject: Counterparty Name Conventions


In accordance with the suggestions provided by Mary Cook in our Legal Dept., 
we have come to an agreement in regard to the naming conventions for 
divisions and trade names. For both divisions and dba/trade names, the 
counterparty name will be formatted to lead with the sub-entity name, 
followed by the parent legal name.

 i.e. division name, division of parent legal name  or  trade name, a dba of 
parent legal name

 Ex. Duke Power, a division of Duke Energy Corporation

This layout will make it easier to choose the correct counterparty name and 
avoid the misconception of duplicate records. Also the legal requirements 
will be met.

Please notify me by Friday, June 8th, if there are any issues with this 
format. Otherwise, the GCP group will commence using this proposed layout on 
current and future requests. 

Cleanup of existing records in GCP and Contracts will be accessed. In cases 
where the requested name could exceed the 90 character length maximum there 
will need to be an evaluation.

If there are any questions, please contact me @ 3-6517.

Thank you,
Marilyn

A US Power financial Swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp. under 
which the Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted 
by Counterparty on the Website (the Fixed Price) in respect of the Notional 
Quantity per Determination Period. The Notional Quantity per Determination 
Period shall be the volume submitted by Counterparty on the Website, 
multiplied by the number of applicable hours in such Determination Period. 
Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a 
Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less 
than one calendar month the Determination Period shall be the term of the 
Transaction. The Payment Date(s) for Transactions which are less than one 
month will be the fifth (5th) Business Day following the last day of the 
month that includes the Determination Period. The Payment Date(s) for 
Transactions which are one month or longer will be the fifth (5th) Business 
Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the 
Product description on the Website.

The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the 
hourly day-ahead prices listed in the Index for electricity delivered during 
Peak hours on each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period.  
The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated 
utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by the New York Independent 
System Operator on its official web site currently located at 
http://mis.nyiso.com/public/P-4Alist.htm, or any successor thereto, under the 
headings "Time Weighted/Integrated Real Time LBMP"  (the "Index").

The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours 
(MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable 
hour for the duration of the Transaction (the "Hourly Quantity').
The transaction is for on-peak ("Peak") hours on each Delivery Day beginning 
with the hour ending 1400 (1:00 pm) and concluding with the hour ending 2300 
(11:00 pm) Eastern Prevailing Time.  'Delivery Day' means a day during the 
term of the transaction that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or 
Friday, excluding any day that is a NERC holiday.

Per our earlier discussions, I am attaching the language we would like added 
to the definition of Index in the long descriptions for all US physical and 
financial pulp, paper and lumber products.  If you have any questions, please 
give Mark or me a call.



Justin, as an FYI, is this something you might want to add to your European 
products as well?


Per our meeting, we need you to (i) check whether you had "Total Premium" or 
"Premium" in your online confirmation, and (ii) give me some language re: 
online trading procedures for the confirmation procedures section.  Thanks!Anthony,

Unless your questions relate to an online problem, can you address your 
master questions to either of the two Susans.  Thanks!At the request of Carol St. Clair, I am attaching our form of EnronOnline 
Password Application, Electronic Trading Agreement, and a sample of each of a 
financial and physical online GTC.






At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am attaching my list of North America 
"utility" counterparties.  My given task when I compiled this list was to 
identify "utilities" and determine if there was a reason we should not 
approve online trading for the counterparty.  We originally denied approval 
for all utilities unless we had a Master Agreement in place or an overriding 
commercial reason to transact.  We are now taking the position that investor 
owned utilities (IOUs) and related corporate entities should be approved for 
trading.  However, we will not approve online trading for governmentals or 
cooperatives when we do not have a master in place, so those counterparties 
identified as such do not need to be included in your review.  Obviously, if 
you are aware of a municipal or cooperative I failed to detect, please let us 
know.  In addition, your review does not need to extend to the Canadian 
counterparties.  We will run those by Canadian counsel.

Please review the list to help us identify the IOUs.  You may ignore the 
"Approved for Trading" column.

For your information, the list was compiled from information provided from 
our Credit Department, from the Company's financial statements which I 
obtained from EDGAR, from the Company's web site, from 
www.utilityconnection.com, or from web searches of the Company when I could 
not locate  information from any of the other sources.

Please give us a call tomorrow to discuss briefly.
We received a Notice from the NYMEX today that they have set March 2 as the 
date for power to go ex-pit.  I will send each of you a copy of the memo.  
Copies are also being immediately hand delivered to Jim Fallon and Tim 
Belden.  Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of 
the referenced Counterparty, which guarantees the obligations of ENA under an 
ISDA Master Agreement.  This Guaranty will supersede and replace the guaranty 
previously given to Counterparty (formerly known as Enserch Energy Services, 
Inc.) dated as of December 16, 1996.  We will need the standard executed copy.

 In addition, we will need the following closing documents:  Certificate of 
Incumbency.

 Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the 
documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
This is from Mark Taylor's presentation he gave for Mark Haedicke at the ISDA 
Energy Seminar in Houston earlier this year.  I know Elizabeth Sager did a 
presentation last month for Mark H. he gave to some power group in D.C.  
Also, Mark T. is currently working on one for bandwith trading for Tom Gros.

Why won't they let you go to the Corp. conference?  It's too bad, this new 
resort across the was from the Hyatt Hill Country where we stayed that last 
time it supposed to be even nicer.  Bummer!  It appears the ECT one is

Subject: Cross Timbers Energy Services, Inc.

Cross Timbers Oil Company has requested that we consolidate our entire 
trading relationship at the above referenced entity.  They have also asked 
that we consider a netting agreement for margining purposes that will allow 
netting of not only financial and physical mark to market, but receivables 
and payables with the combined mark to market. They have offered a parent 
guaranty from Cross Timbers Oil Company to cover existing exposure with a 
built-in cushion to cover future transactions.

As I see it, there are several credit and legal issues within their request.  
First, is credit comfortable wearing the aggregate amount of exposure, and 
does an enormous guaranty from a BB- company get us there?  If so, is legal 
comfortable with the concept (as in Torch Energy Marketing's case) of an 
overall netting agreement across products, receivables, payables, and mark to 
market?  Finally, are we comfortable transacting with the entity that has no 
assets, but rather is simply backed by a guaranty.  

If we do figure out that we can accommodate their request, we will need to 
assign the master agreements and all transactions under the agreements from 
Cross Timbers Oil Company to Cross Timbers Energy Services, Inc.  We will 
also need to amend the outstanding guaranty, extend its tenure and increase 
its amount.  

I will address the credit issues within our group, and I think we should try 
to schedule a meeting between legal and credit to discuss whether or not the 
netting agreement requested is possible.  I will make a call up to legal 
later this morning to compare schedules and try to set up a time to meet.  
Meanwhile, please call me with any questions, concerns or suggestions.

Regards,

John

When you have a minute, I've been inputting data all week and have 
fixes/upgrades we need to the database.  In particular, the EOL people are 
about to introduce a new product any time time now, and I need that sort the 
shows "Approved, approved with limits, not approved" to work so I won't have 
to look at each of 1500 entries to determine what limits are in place.  When 
you arrive Monday can you let me know how long it will take you to have that 
sort working.  Then, maybe we can get together and discuss other changes we 
need to make.

Much thanks!Attached please find referenced list.  No european power products approved

gave him a call to see what his timing was, he said ite wasn't urgent, but if 
we could get an attorney looking at it, to get it final maybe next week.  It

San Diego has applied for a Password Application and wants to trade 
financial.  Per them, they have already been trading financial off-line with 
us, and I check with the Confirm Desk and that statement is true, Craig 
Breslau has done financial trades with them (I thought they weren't allowed 
to trade financial?!).  Anyway, can we now open them up to trade financial?Do any of the other trading groups have any masters in place with 
Transammonia, Inc. or any of its divisions, such as Trammochem, Trammo Gas or 
TrammoGas & Petrochemicals?  Can you let me know ASAP.  Thanks!I am meeting with the exterminator tomorrow a.m.  He said he would arrive 
between 8-9 am, if he shows up more toward 9 I might not be back yet, if he 
shows up more towards 8, 10:00 will probably be fine.---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 01/25/2000 04:46 PM

Bob:

This communication is to keep everyone informed of the back office issues 
related to EOL trades with Aquilia 

The Aquilia office (Aquilia Energy) in Omaha contacted our Settlements team 
regarding the EOL day deals(invoices) stating that they were not Aquilia 
Energy or Aquilia Risk Deals but rather Aquilia Southwest deals.  Aquilia 
Southwest is not approved for EOL trading.  To ensure timely payment, 
Settlements faxed all the invoices to the San Antonio office and have been 
notified that payment for these invoices to Aquilia Energy and Aquilia Risk 
will be made by Aquilia Southwest.  Aquilia wanted us to change the 
counterparty to Aquilia Southwest but it was explained to them that these 
were EOL deals and the counterparty would not be changed.  

Scott Mills provided a query of Jan. EOL deals to (just for Texas business) 
Settlements to help them gauge and anticipate potential counterparty issues.  

Settlements might be able to have another billing address set up for Aquilia 
Energy with the address being the San Antonio office in order to minimize the 
effort to getting the invoices to the correct office.  

I have not heard anything more regarding an assignment processes for Aquilia 
Risk/Energy and would like to know were that stands.  I would like 
clarification about Aquilia Risk having credit approval taken away for 
Physical deals.  

Thanks,
KC




Attached is the list for 1/24/00. 

 For the list dated 1/25/00 which only had one amended counterparty, First 
Energy Corp., I have a change in my earlier approval, from the Power Group.   
I don't have a code for this, so I'll just tell you, for this Counterparty 
Enron call SELL power only to them pursuant to an on-line GTC.  This 
Counterparty cannot sell to us via EOL.
Working late, huh!?!Attached is the referenced list.  Again, no european power products for US 
counterparties until further notice.  Also, Renaissance is an Amended 
approval, so I just wrote in the corner-amended-no change, since I have no 
change in the  earlier approvals I told you.


Don't feel left out, but you're the only person I haven't heard from...

We have no record of such an ISDA Master or any other financial master being 
in place with this counterparty.  Could it be drugs?!!I hope you know I was joking with you...I was a little hesitant about sending 
that message...I'm glad to hear from you!  I guess I'm a little confused.  I thought you 
were going to send me your form.  I would be happy to send ours.  I can draft 
one up in a jiffy.  Just let me know what you prefer.

P.S.  Isn't email wonderful!The Lower Colorado River Authority has called and is ready to do financial 
business with us and wants to get a revised draft of the ISDA.  The credit on 
the draft I sent them before is quite old, so I need someone to get me new 
credit or tell me if the old credit is still ok.

Respectfully,We are going to open San Diego Gas & Electric to transact the following 
financial products, but are going to limit the length of the trades to 3 
months or less.  The approved products per the Master Agreement are any 
"swap, cap, floor, collar or option...based on the prices of crude oil, 
petroleum products, natural gas, or electric power...".

I have previously not distributed the executed Master Agreement because of 
unresolved issues with the counterparty, but will send copies today to the 
usual distribution.  We have an executed Master Energy Price Swap Agreement 
in place between ECT and the counterparty dated as of February 25, 1997.  All 
financial trades for this counterparty should go under the master.It appears that you are signed up for this class, and the confirmation and 
approval should go to you & Scott.  Remember that you will be charged if you 
do not cancel if you are not going to go (and the charge for canceling is 
pretty high, about $1000.  There is no charge if you attend.  Also, let me 
know if you don't get the proper approval forms.

I need to sign up one of our U.K. attorneys for the Derivatives I class being 
held August 9-10 in Houston.  His name is Mark Elliott, his boss for approval 
purposes is Scott Sefton, head of London Legal, and Scott's billing 
information is 912/0729.  Can you please confirm Mark's time for this class 
as we need to book his plane reservations.  If you like, you can contact Mark 
via email for approvals, just let me know that that is how you plan on 
proceeding.  Thanks for your help.


FINANCIAL:

We have an ISDA Master in place, originally through Transammonia, Inc., 
acting through its division Trammochem.  That master has since been expanded 
to allow trading through additional divisions, Trammo Gas Division and Trammo 
Gas & Petrochemicals Division.  All trades and confirms can be done as 
follows:

Transammonia, Inc.
Transammonia, Inc. acting though its division Trammochem
Transammonia Inc. acting through its Trammo Gas Division
Transammonia Inc., acting through its Trammo Gas & Petrochemicals Division

Obviously, Transammonia, Inc., the body corporate, needs to always be on the 
confirm.

PHYSICAL:

My reports from the other Legal trading groups are that they have no 
contracts in place, although it is somewhat unclear on the physical gas side 
as to whether Global Contracts as to whether we have any physical gas master 
in place.Mark just had to run down quick to a meeting.  When he gets out we'll give 
you a call & go over this stuff.  We really appreciate your help!If you are in Houston on Feb 10 and HAVE NOT PLANNED ON HAVING DINNER WITH 
ME, then just don't plan on coming.  I mean, after your last lame excuse 
about that hotel by the airport, I'm gonna take it real personal if the only 
hotel room you can get this time is in Pearland.  Ya know what I mean...

Anyway, I have been thinking about you and wondering what you're up to.  For 
the Enron Corp. Legal Conference, real cool people (like me) are signing up 
for the raft trip, so as long as the weather's nice we're going to be 
floating down the Guadalupe drinking some brews.  So if you were cool you'd 
be hanging out with the cool group (like me)...what are your plans?!!---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 01/27/2000 05:24 PM

Attached please find referenced list.  Again, no European power for US 
counterparties until further notice.
Please be advised that the NYMEX ACCESS training session will be held from 
10:00 am - 2:00 pm at the DoubleTree Hotel in the Allen Center.Usually y'all let me know who's working on the Credit and when I can expect 
some, but since I didn't hear back I thought that y'all just forgot about me 
since I'm not on the day to day stuff...there is no particular urgency, next 
week is fine...Per your request, attached is our sample ISDA Schedule for a plain U.S. 
corporate entity.
I feel better already...sniff...sniff...Attached please find referenced list.  As usual, no European power for U.S.

1. CMS Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company is not on any of my lists as a 
FERC-authorized power marketer, and we do NOT have a trading relationship 
with them.  Therefore, this entity is NOT authorized to trade U.S. power 
products.

2. Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC is a current trading partner.  I have 
a few calls out to see if I need to restrict their access to Enron Sales only 
and will let you know in a bit.

Here is my revised list incorporating Leslie Hansen's power comments.
Attached please find referenced list.  The only amended counterparty with a 
change was Murphy Exploration which was shut down for power.  I wonder, when 
we are working with amended counterparties, if there is some way that my 
prior approval could be on the recent spread sheet?  Right now I have to go 
find the old spread sheet to find out what I approved it for last time to see 
if I have any problem with the change.  So usually, unless I have - change 
next to amended, it means I had no change to what I said before.  Does that 
make sens?
I am actually working on the pieces of the project, but the overall "system" 
still needs to be designed.  I've been working with our computer people to 
upgrade our master swap agreement database.  We will be capturing some 
additional information that we hope will somehow later on feed into the 
autoconfirm process.  Then, once we work out confidentiality issues relating 
to our comments section and different companies, we will be opening the 
database to all interested ENA employees.  

I've developed two new databases, we're currently working the kinks out of.   
First is our" jurisdictional database", which will summarize the swap laws as 
they relate to each country.  Our international business is growing and its 
becoming imperative that we get this up and going.  I've actually got the 
database designed, we're working some kinks out and I hope lawyers can start 
briefing the country information soon.

Of course, the compelling project for us over the last 6-9 months has been 
online trading.  I was made the primary legal contact to deal with all the 
business units for online trading counterparty approvals and contract 
information.  With thousands of counterparties being approved initially and 
on a ongoing basis we needed a database to keep track of which counterparties 
we have approved or disapproved, and tie each product to a contract.   We 
have that system ready now and I am finishing having the data inputted.

The other part of the system will be our Library of research memoranda, legal 
advice, etc.  This will be a cross product library (financial, physical, 
power, etc).  I think I am going to dupe a database the European office has 
in place to create ours.  The major complaint I have heard from some of them 
is that the index is not user friendly and they cannot find things when they 
want them.  So I've got to create a lawyer user friendly index.    Among 
other documents, this is I think where our forms might reside, in addition, 
all the research and advice on various legal issues we've received from 
outside counsel, as well as ISDA Netting Opinions and the like.  I think this 
Library will be maintained on the same worldwide web our contracts are being 
scanned into and kept.  I think we can buy a scanner that will scan the 
documents in, then the web is already set up so we can have our documents 
available around the world.  So the setup for this might go quickly, although 
compiling all of our legal advice from the various offices and lawyers might 
be more of a problem.

The last part we've got to develop is the then overall place or site for all 
these various databases.  So I think necessity has made me develop the pieces 
before the overall system. 

Maybe when you have time we can have a chat about all this.---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 01/31/2000 05:13 PM

Your message about the Canadian forms inspired me to visit with Mark.  We 
were in the middle of updating the Canadian forms, and Mark just gave me a 
few final changes, and as soon as I make those I'll email them up to you.  
Actually we have two Canadian forms, the ISDA and the "Industrial".Have you had a chance to look at that confirm language yet.  The trade was 
done a few days ago, and the clock is ticking on how long we can get a 
confirm out before we get in trouble.---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 02/01/2000 05:09 PM

Subject: BC Gas Utility

The commercial person from BC Gas called me today to complain about the 
securities rep and warrant that we put in the confirm.  I thought I had 
resolved this by having you guys amend the ISDA and then we could remove it 
from the confirms.  She now tells me their position is that the rep and 
warrant was not pre-negotiated and was not in place at the time they entered 
the trades so they will not sign any confirms containing the rep & warrant 
and further they will only "consider" signing the amendment.  I tried my best 
to explain that there corporation could be harmed if they did not make the 
representation and she seemed to be making a big deal over a non-commercial 
point and she was the only counterparty to complain but I got nowhere.  Is it 
possible to send them amended confirms without the rep & warrant before we 
here back from them about the ISDA?  This would make them happy and get off 
my back.  Let me know.

Thanks

Doug
I spoke to Howard Volz at CT Corporation today, and he said he sent the 
renewal to DAPSA in November (their renewal date is Feb. 1 of each year) and 
hasn't heard from them.  I asked him to refax the renewal notice to them.  He 
said CT will not revoke the consent for about 5-6 more weeks, so we've got 
some time to resolve this.  I'll keep you posted.---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 02/02/2000 05:44 PM

Netting Agreement for Petro-Canada at year end?


Attached please find referenced list.  Again, no European power for U.S. 
counterparties until further notice.  On Sithe Power where we only changed 
the counterparty id #, there is no change from my previous approval.
I understand there is a little confusion regarding what products we can trade 
under the "Master Master"  for the referenced Counterparty.  It's not 
surprising, it's a confusing master!  This is currently the only agreement we 
have in place that contains terms for trading both physical and financial 
transactions in one agreement.

There is a Master Trading Agreement dated February 22, 1996 in place between 
ECT and  AIG Trading Corporation, now known as Sempra Energy Trading Corp. 
(Global Contract Reference No. 96000160).  This agreement provides for 
financial Swap, Option and Swaption transactions (excluding weather), and 
further provides for physical natural gas transactions only.  It does not 
provide for any other physical products.

Just a reminder to talk to me Monday about the utilities.  I was not aware we 
were not currently trading financial power, which they are getting ready to 
open up.  I figure the utilities will start squealing loudly when they cannot 
trade.  So, I've go to start opening up my utilities...Marie was just telling me about your rough tour of duty in the French Alps 
next week.  I speak a little high school French...perhaps you might need some 
assistance while you are there...?! How do they override letters go out?  Do you tell someone, do I need to?Can you please shut this counterparty down for weather.  Thanks!Thanks for your email.  I don't want to state the obvious because you appear 
to already be in compliance, but just as a precaution, I want to make sure 
you are aware the ECT has a policy which prohibits it employees/traders from 
trading in anything the company trades in.  Any trading you do for your own 
account must comply with this policy.  Attached please find the referenced list.  On the amended counterparties, 
Southwestern Public Service Company is the only one with a change, with Enron 
sells power only, and on the only new counterparty, Minnesota Power, we've 
got Enron selling power only also.  Again, no European power for U.S.

Sorry, I got carried away with numbers.
Marie and I had a giggle over your email!Who's Dana?Mark and I were discussing my potential purchase of a car, and were looking 
at some web sites, and thought we would pass on the following car buying web 
sites:

www.edmunds.com (tells you what prices to pay for cars, safety records)

www.consumer.org (Consumer Reports Magazine Web Site, more to car safety, 
repair records)

www.carclub.com (if you go to "research advice", then click on "crash test 
results" they have some info on SUV crash tests.  Since y'all don't have as 
many SUV's on the road in England you may not know that some of them have 
failed the crash tests big time, and that also because their point of gravity 
is up higher they tend to rollover (or "tump" as we say here in Texas) when 
you make a sharp turn (like to avoid an accident).

Anyway, we were a little concerned about your safety...You narratives aren't too long, I'm just giving you some grief!I have created a database for the Legal Dept., somewhat similar to how the 
master swap agreement database works, for us to keep track of our approvals 
for EOL trading, as well as any executed amendments to the EOL Password 
Application, ETA, GTC, or any other EOL documents.

I have been inputting the data for the Houston based Credit counterparties, 
and was wondering whether you want me to input the London based Credit 
counterparties or not.  I have no idea whether you've approved them or not, 
you'll have to input that data, or you could send it to me and I can input it 
for you.  Also, I don't know what counterparties you've had since the initial 
three big counterparty lists...But I know you are busy and it might be hard 
for you to find the time to input the initial counterparty data, unless you 
have an assistant do that.

Anyway, we (me, since I'm the one approving all new counterparties for every 
Legal Group in Houston!) have been using it and are finding it very 
helpful).  It is also helpful for when I'm out so Mark Taylor can look to see 
whether I've approved a counterparty or not and what rationale I had for the 
approval (usually I only put in info when I don't approve a counterparty).  
Anyway, the link to the database is attached, so why don't you take a look at 
it just to see what I'm doing.

We're still working on some of the sorts and inputting the data, so it's not 
fully operational yet.  Anyway, give me your thoughts...Don't make any 
changes, it'll screw things up...

5.  Nancy said front door handle is loose
6.  Do we have any drips in sinks?

The floor refinishers will show up Monday morning.  They are going to 
refinish downstairs floors and my back stairwell.

I would like to recarpet upstairs.  Where do you suggest I go to get new 
carpeting?Two emails and still no response...was it something I said?!Can you change it on my calendar.  Thanks!Attached please find the referenced list.  Since all the counterparties are 
amended counterparties, my changes are as follows:

1.  Statoil - no change in earlier approvals

2.  Texla -  I don't think it's a change, but they cannot trade US power, 
also there is no change for financial, I previously said and we continue not 
to trade financial.

3.  Avista Corporation- Washington Water Power Division.  For financial 
trading for Avista Corporation I previously said no financial trading.  I am 
going to open them up for all financial trading.  They can trade under the 
Avista Corporation name, or they can trade as Avista Corporation, acting 
through its Washington Water Power Division.   For power trading,  they can 
trade all US West power products, but can Enron can only sell to Avista for 
US East power products.

Again, no European power for US counterparties until further notice.
Just a reminder to talk to Tim Belden...As a follow-up to our conversation in London when you said I should bring to 
your attention any concerns I might have with financial trading issues, the 
following has recently come up as an issue here in Houston (and does so from 
time to time).   We will, in fact, be discussing it at our group meeting next 
week.   I spoke to Edmund about it when I was there in London, but in light 
of the recent Canadian form problems and the resulting concerns of Mark 
Haedicke with the integrity of our forms, I thought I should bring this your 
attention.

 One of our continuing concerns on the financial trading side is that every 
financial trading lawyer/paralegal work from the centrally approved forms.  
The Houston forms are currently located in a "read-only" directory.  We need 
to be careful that users copy the forms out of the directory each time they 
use the form.  Copying the form into a personal directory for ease of use 
creates issues with people working from outdated base forms, or having forms 
evolve without  approval.

Another way forms get changed without going through the approval process is 
when an attorney tells the paralegals to make a change in every swap 
agreement they approve.  It counts as a form change, not a negotiation 
change, if you make it in every agreement.

Ultimately our goal is to centralize the forms in a database easily 
accessible to all of us on a global basis (this is a central and critical 
component of the Fishkin Project).

Thanks for your attention to this.---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 02/11/2000 08:46 AM

I have not heard back from DAPSA with respect to the Consent to Service of

referenced counterparty to trade all financial products.Just a reminder...to talk to Tim Belden....Why do we have two active masters?!  Because it appears that Synder/Santa Fe 
merged and Susan B. did not handle to multiple master issue!In looking through Lotus Notes for EOL, it appears we have two active masters

master?The master agreement for this counterparty appears to not cover the Trade

You are the woman!Please find attached the referenced list.  For Enserco Energy, Inc., my 
previous approvals remain the same except for power, which has been shut down 
for trading (I can't just copy the last excel spreadsheet since the columns 
are not in the same order anymore).  Then, the only other new counterparty is 
also shut down for power but open for everything else.
We need to amend the master on Williams, and Mark asked me to see you about 
it because this type of amendment might have to be made to a number of 
counterparty masters.  When you have some time, can I come around...Thanks...---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 02/14/2000 03:29 PM

Team,

Can we please amend the collateral threshold in the draft ISDA for the above 
referenced counterparty?  The new collateral threshold amount should be 
$2,500,000.  No other changes are necessary to the document and I hope 
therefore that a full credit worksheet will not be necessary.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Fred is looking for this asap, so 
if we could have it to him by noon or so tomorrow, he will be quite 
appreciative.


Thanks,

Attached please find the referenced lists.  Please note the following:

1.  For Puget Sound, no change in our earlier approvals except for power.  
For power, open for West products, but ENRON SALES only for East products.

2.  For Ferrell International Limited, Credit shows them as an amended CP, 
but I have no record of seeing them before, so I treated them as a new CP.  

Again, no European power for U.S. counterparties.




We have received the executed Letter Agreement dated February 8, 2000 
amending the Electronic Trading Agreement with the referenced counterparty.  
Copies will be distributed in the usual mannerI have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated 
as of May 25, 1999.  This amendment deletes the prior Confidentiality 
provision in the ISDA Master Agreement and replaces it with our current 
Confidentiality language.  This change will allow either party to provide

Subject: Swap for LV Cogen

Here are the details on the LV Cogen change so that you can get it into the 
system.

We are going to amend the Gas Swap confirm referencing the Inside FERC 
Natural Gas Week (Ref Deal No. N02595.1).

The change will be to delete the floating price reference to Inside FERC NW 
Pipeline and change it from Inside FERC NW Pipeline to the Natural Gas Week 
Opal( Ref Deal No. N02595.2).  This will make the two confirms for 2500 
MMbtu/d match each other.  The Fixed price component basis on the revised 
confirm will change from <$0.28> to <$0.27>.

We are currently working on a confirm.

Let me know ASAP if you have an issues with the change.

No, I didn't get it.  Just reply back to this email & reattach it.Can we do a "See" dropdown like the Master Swap Agreement Database, so we can 
track name changes?  Thanks!  As a follow-up to our conversation, the referenced counterparty is not an

Pan Canadian Energy Services has the following request:

For all EOL traded deals they do not want to recieve the Annex A that is 
attached to our Omnibus-EOL templates.  They claim that since they have 
already signed off on the GTC in order to trade on EOL, then they do not want 
to repeat any work and have to review an additional GTC when we send them a 
Confirmation.  Is it possible to exclude any Annex A (GTC) when we send an 
Omnibus Confirmation for trades done on EOL?

Legal contact @ PanCanadian is Rick Tucker @ 713-331-5049

Attached is the referenced counterparty approval list.  On Encal, the only

approval, but Leslie shut them down for power.  All other prior approvals for

In addition, if you could give me the Legal Contact Person in London for the

If you can assist, thanking you most kindly in advance. With kind regards.

I don't understand what it is I haven't completed.  Can you let me know so I 
can complete the form.  Thanks!The Legal/Credit Meeting scheduled for today is canceled due to the absence 
of Susan Flynn.What if there is no specific job.  I spoke to Mary Solmonson in Global 
Contracts and she said they had several job offerings and to send the resume 
to her and she would take a look at it and forward it to the relevant groups?EOL needs to hear ASAP whether Nicor Gas Company is approved to trade 
online...can you let me know...thanks!Attached is the referenced approval list.

 Attached is the revised Referral Form and Resume for Patty Young.  I hope 
this does it!


Tonight I'm going to see a house after work today and then I have a late 
Sergei workout.  But keep me in mind in the future...

I finally got your application accepted by our personnel group, so now I can 
forward it to the respective groups for review.  One of the bad things about 
big corporations are the forms you have to fill out to do anything...---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 02/24/2000 02:03 PM

Hi,

Per Bob Bowen's request, I have attached the Special Handling List.  Please 
let me know if I can further assist you.

Sheetal Patel :)

 
At our Group meeting this past week we discussed paying the consent to 
service of process ourselves, just so we can make sure it stays in place, 
since it's not such a large amount of money.  Sara Shackleton is heading down 
there next week and was going to discuss this with you...we just wanted to 
give you a head's up about our thinking on this.I'll pass on any other articles on the transportation industry that might be 
in our various derivatives magazines .  Glad you liked this one!What's the scoop, can't come up with ten Top 10's?!!  I never thought I'd see 
the day...Dear Mr. Zunic,

Pursuant to the request of Fred Lagrasta, I am attaching a sample form of our 
Master Agreement.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Fred at (713) 853-6529 
if you have any comments or questions.
With respect to the referenced lists, all the counterparties on these lists 
are amended counterparties and there are no changes to our earlier approvals.

FYI, Credit did not have Ionic Energy down as an amended counterparty, but 
per my conversation with Tom Moran, it was on the initial second list, and 
should be treated as an amended counterparty. Below is the new drop down I need added:

Trade Option Representation (choose one only):

 standard
 weather included
 enron must be offeree
 none
 other

Mike, the above should have a box to check, and the box should always check 
"standard" unless someone goes in and effectively changes it.

Then add the following:

Other trading provisions

 pulp & paper
 FRABBA

Switching databases to the EnronOnline database:

We need to add a category for a new product, Credit Derivatives, have a 
comment box just like financial or power, have it follow after power.This will confirm our conversation today regarding which European 
jurisdictions are approved for trading credit derivatives:  the U.K., Sweden, 
Norway, Finland and Switzerland.

The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives 
include:  France, Germany, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and 
The Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it 
may be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved 
jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be 
determined on a case by case basis.

Per our conversation, Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit 
derivatives.

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.Attached please find the referenced list.  I haven't said it for a few lists, 
but remember, no European power for US counterparties until further notice...

Greg,

It appears we send Dynegy Canada a draft ISDA in July of 1999, and got no 
response from them.  We will need to update the ISDA we sent them in July 
since our form has changed since then.  Once we get the go ahead from John 
Suttle in Credit as to whether we need to update the credit, we will prepare 
the ISDA Master Agreement you have requested.My pleasure...!There are no changes from my previous approvals for the two counterparties on 
this list.No, they never gave me an updated copy.We have received the executed ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross 
Border) executed 04/08/99, effective as of 06/09/98.  Copies will be 
distributed.

We also received the originally executed Confirmation, Deal # EM3927.1,2 & 
3.  I will sent it down to the Confirmation Desk.---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 03/01/2000 08:57 AM

Per my conversation with Credit, it appears there are two Northern States 
Power Companies.  We have already reviewed Northern States Power Company, a 
Minnesota corporation (cpy ID #265).  The counterparty that showed up on 
yesterday's list is Northern States Power Company, a Wisconsin corporation 
(cpy ID #161).  The Wisconsin corporation is a sub of the Minnesota 
corporation.

I don't know if this makes any difference in your approvals...Robin Newman
Matthew Bender & Co.
212/448-2168With the execution of the Wisconsin Gas Company master, this brings the total 
executed financial masters to 400.  The countdown to 500 executed financial 
masters is now starting!  Congratulations to the Legal and Credit teams for 
getting us to this point and for a job well done!---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 03/02/2000 08:43 AM

Leslie,

Why am I getting this information below?  These counterparties are not on my

counterparties below, and you just want me to put this info in the EOL Legal 
Database?

Frank:

1.  Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership is not authorized to 
trade any U.S. power products.  (We are currently in litigation with Midland 
and are not trading with this CP.) 

2.  Otter Tail Power Company -- Enron Sales only pursuant to on-line GTCs.  
We do not have any trading agreements with this CP so it is not necessary to 
send an override letter.

3.  Florida Power Corporation and Carolina Power & Light Company -- Enron 
Sales only pursuant to on-line GTCs.  Each of these CPs should receive an 
override letter in the form attached below.

With regard to our annual review of this list of laws we need to comply with, 
do we not want to add the Canadian provinces new "eligible swap participant" 
equivalant rules?Rick Tucker at Pan Canadian (he used to be at PG&E) called and has been 
speaking to Willie Harrell on the Confirm Desk, and I believe Willie spoke to 
Mark about this issue yesterday, but it appears to be unresolved and I think 
Mark was going to talk to you about it.

Pan Canadian is doing EOL trades, and wants to know why he keeps getting the 
online confirms w/the GTC's attached since the way the system is set up he 
technically is already agreeing to the GTC's online.  He feels he is having 
to look at a lot of unnecessary paper.

Rick will be out of the office Friday and Monday, but was hoping you could 
give him a call Tuesday to discuss this issue.  His phone # is 713/331-5049.

FYI, we do not have a master in place with Pan Canadian Energy Services.Attached please find the referenced lists.  Please note:

Tampa Electric Company can do power sells only.  Even though Peoples Gas is a 
division of Tampa Electric, it cannot trade power because its power marketing 
license was not granted in that name.  Further, I earlier shut down Tampa 
Electric Company for financial trading, and I am now opening them up for 
financial trading, either as Tampa Electric or Peoples Gas.


I am confirming my conversation with you yesterday and my conversation a 
minute ago with Lori Volpi at Dynegy Canada.  As we discussed, Dynegy Canada 
is trading with both ECC and ENA, with the bulk of its trading being done 
with ECC.  Instead of getting two ISDA Master Agreements in place, we will 
enter into an ISDA Master Agreement between ECC and Dynegy Canada, and then 
just back-to-back any ENA trades down to Houston by virtue of the Services 
Agreement for Financial Agreements we have in place between ECC and ENA.   
Per my conversation with Lori, this will also work with the EOL trades since 
the Electronic Trading Agreement provides that any financial trades done for 
either ECC or ENA will be transacted under the respective master agreement in 
place with either ECC or ENA.

Works for me...!It appears this class is on a Sunday & a Monday.  Did I get this right?---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 03/03/2000 08:44 AM

I would be more than happy to update the database with any comments you may 
want me to add, don't ever feel bad, when I don't expect something I just 
need to know what it's about.

I hope we can open the EOL Legal Database soon so you can update any comments 
or notes directly into it.In response to your email:

1.  The NYMEX did not have Dana Davis down as a user because he just 
completed and signed his application Wednesday evening and the NYMEX received 
the application by Fedex Thursday.  It will take several days for them to 
process his application.  Further, he still needs to attend their training 
session in NY (I hope this coming Wednesday) before he will be able to trade 
online.

2.  As far as the problem with only one user being able to get in NYMEX 
ACCESS at a time.  I have a call into the NYMEX about this.  We get a 
terminal per seat, so since we have two seats, we get two terminals at no 
cost.  The 3 additional terminals have to be leased from other NYMEX members 
and the NYMEX is arranging the initial lease for us and will pay the lease, 
cost free for the first 6 months.  After 6 months any cost associated with 
the 3 additonal terminals will have to be borne by ENA.  I have a call into 
the NYMEX to find out what the status of our 3 leases is.

3.  Bruce, per your voicemail about you or a member of your group having the 
ability to change operator access to these terminals, changes in the terminal 
operator approvals can only be done by the two seatholders, who are currently 
Mark Haedicke and Kevin Hannon.  Any changes with respect to operators will 
have to be done by full application to the NYMEX, therefore, such process 
should continue to be done through the Legal Department.Below are the account numbers at Salomon Smith Barney that you will need to 
trade NYMEX ACCESS power:

PJM  017 90327
CIN  017 90316
ENT  017 90317
PV  017 90404
COB  017 90405

For those of you who haven't done business with Salomon Smith Barney before, 
our trader contact there is John Galperin at (212) 723-7284.---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 03/06/2000 02:01 PM

I spoke to Gabriela and so long as there are no live trades we should just 
put this master on inactive status.  If the counterparty were ever to want to 
do another trade it would be conditioned upon obtaining another process 
agent.  Gabriela also feels that any further trading with the counterparty 
should be pursuant to another credit review since control of the company has 
changed hands.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  Thanks.

Just a reminder to send me a memo asking me to delete Bob Shultz as and EOL 
signatory and add Sheri Thomas in his place.  Much thanks!Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving Germany to the 
approved list for trading credit derivatives.  Below is the list, now updated 
to reflect this change.

European jurisdictions which are are approved for trading credit 
derivatives:  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K..

The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives 
include:  France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and The 
Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may 
be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved 
jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be 
determined on a case by case basis.

Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit derivatives.

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.To confirm our conversation, can you add "Credit Derivatives" as a new 
products to my database.  We will need the same drop downs as the other 
produsts (gas trading, financial trading, etc.).

Thanks!I am aware that you need a list from me, I am working on it right now.  I 
just got the list from EOL yesterday and I'm reviewing it as fast as I can.  
My goal is to get it done by the end of my workday, so you should have it 
when you arrive in the morning.There should be no question of duplication of ISDA Master Agreement or any 
other master swap agreements between Houston and London, because Houston's 
contracting party is usually Enron North America Corp. and London's 
contracting party is usually Enron Capital & Trade Resources International 
Corp.  We cannot do business under each others' financial master agreements 
for legal and tax reasons.

ENA and Enron Canada Corp. can do business under each other's masters because 
the tax reasons that used to require us to separate out the business went 
away.  Further, Houston and Canada subsequently entered into a Services 
Agreement which sets forth the conditions upon which they can act on each 
other's behalf (necessary for tax and legal reasons).Below is the list of the final work we need you to bid on for the downstairs 
apartment:

1.  Paint inside of bathroom cabinets
2.  Paint outside and inside of kitchen cabinets
3.  Fix bottom of drawer of kitchen cabinet located right of dishwasher
4.  Replace closet rod in front bedroom to match other closet's rod
5.  Hammer down shelf ends that are loose in closet in back bedroom
6.  Clean ends of door hardware that have drips on them.
7.  Rehang blinds (we'll have to buy new hardware for existing blinds and 
then I will have to buy new blinds if any were bent by the kids)

My confirmation of the class showed the 8/8 and 8/9.  You may want to go in 
and check your schedule.Mark says I need to talk to you about the Credit Derivatives confirmation 
process...Please add TXU Energy Trading Company to list.  We had an old style "ERMS" 
master in place, so they weren't allowed to do power, but now we have an ISDA 
in place (even tho' Brant Reves threw out the new guaranty, but that is 
another story!), so I am going to open them up for weather.---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 03/07/2000 06:14 PM

Attached is the referenced list.  I am responsible for those counterparties 
originating from Houston Credit.  Edmund Cooper is responsible for the UK 
Credit based counterparties.  I am still resolving issues on about 8-10 
counterparties.  If something doesn't make sense, let me know.
Can you let me know what the scoop is on those countries and I will update my

Subject: Update to Approved Jurisdictions - Credit Derivatives

Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving Germany to the 
approved list for trading credit derivatives.  Below is the list, now updated 
to reflect this change.

European jurisdictions which are are approved for trading credit 
derivatives:  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K..

The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives 
include:  France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and The 
Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may 
be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved 
jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be 
determined on a case by case basis.

Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit derivatives.

Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.

Dear Justin

Marly asked me to respond to you.

As you know, the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many
companies. Therefore, any trade mark registration that incorporates the word
ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to
prevent others from using the word ONLINE.

Given the above, if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON (which
covers the services that you offer on-line as well as your core activities),
I'd say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably
unnecessary. However, if you use a particular logo for the on-line service,
that should be registered.

I hope the above is clear.

Jonathan Day

Can you please give me a call to discuss trademarking?

i.e. Are we covered if we proceed a word with "Enron"?  e.g.: EnronEAuction.

If we are covered, then was it necessary to register EnronOnline?

Thanks,

You are the best!We have some files in an empty cubicle that kinda look like global contract 
files.  They have global contract sheets and numbers attached to the front of 
the documents in the files.  If they belong to anyone in your group they need 
to be claimed now, because we are doing a cubicle restructuring this weekend 
and those files will be moved and if unclaimed eventually gotten rid of.  Can 
you have someone comeWe've received a personal invitation to a NYMEX  Crawfish Boil on April 3 at 
5:00 at Garden in the Heights at 3926 Feagan.  The cause of this celebration 
is the 10th anniversary of the Nat Gas futures contract.  It would be nice if 
Shankman and John Arnold could attend.  Perhaps you can give them a personal 
invitation...We have received the amendment to the BC Gas ISDA Master executed by BC Gas, 
which adds the Canadian Securities Representation, so we don't have to add 
the rep into every confirm.  BC Gas won't sign the confirms with the rep in, 
and this has caused much difficulties.  I am going to count it as signed, 
since BC Gas has signed, but we still need it to be signed by ECC.  Can you 
get it signed ASAP and back to me.  Much thanks.We have received the executed  Amendment to the Subscription Agreement with 
WeatherTrade, Inc. dated March 2, 2000.  This Amendment amends the 
Transaction Fee referenced in subparagraph (c) of the Fee Schedule to the

reference mergers & name changes!It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the 
freeze panel button on, and you probably didn't see them at first.  I didn't 
either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up.  When you have 
a minute, I'll give me a call and I'll come around and show you how to 
unfreeze the panel.I spoke to Edmund to get the scoop on what we are going to be doing on the 
confirms for Credit Derivatives, and he said that his current understanding 
is that all of the confirms will be done out of London.  I communicated that 
to Bob Bowen.  He also said that London was going to be hiring 120 people to 
deal with the Credit Derivatives business.  Wow!Carol, will you handle this or Mark?

ISDA has published the referenced supplement.  Among other changes, the 
supplement adds hundreds of new gas, liquids and power price sources.  Copies 
will be distributed to you.Attached is the referenced list.  Some comments:  We got a master financial 
agreement in place with Calpine Power Services  Company so it has been opened 
up to trade all financial.  Also, we replaced the old style "ERMS Master" 
with an ISDA, so I am opening TXU Energy Trading Company for all financial 
products as well.

For Trammo Gas, we got a letter from them a while back, reflecting under 
what  names they can do financial trading under (I sent you all an email 
about this about a month to two months ago).  That letter had the 
counterparty styled "Transammonia, Inc. acting through its  Trammo Gas 
Division".  I believe I already siad they could trade financial under that 
name.   Let's just be consistent about how we deal with these divisions...
David,

I know we've met before on your visits to Houston, I am a paralegal in the 
ENA Legal Department, in the Swap Group under Mark Taylor.  I am the lead 
contact in ENA Legal for counterparty approvals and day to day trading issues 
for EnronOnline.  I coordinate responses for the whole Legal Trading Group 
(financial, physical, power and emerging markets) with the EnronOnline and 
Credit teams.

I understand from my EnronOnline team that I am going to need to approve 
financial trading for all my Houston based counterparties a week from 
Friday.  Right now that list stands at about 600 counterparties (already 
trading).   I was hoping you could direct me as to what restrictions, if any, 
we might have for financial trading in Australia.  Are there any restricted 
counterparties, such as governmentals, utilities, banks, dealers, etc., or 
any restrictions on the products traded (initially I know we are only trading 
financial power, although I'm sure the list will expand over time).   Have 
your GTC's been drafted with cross-border trading in mind?

Similarly, I assume there will be Australian counterparties signing up to 
trade, and the commercial team will want them approved to trade the whole 
range of EnronOnline products.   Are there any provisions we must add to the 
form of North American product GTCs if our counterparties trade a North 
American product from Australia?  Do we have any tax issues or language we 
need to cover?  Our standard form of GTC includes New York law and 
arbitration.  Will that be enforceable in Australia?  Are there any issues we 
need to address if we require collateral (a guaranty or letter of credit) 
with respect to a trade?

I am still the person who does the NYMEX filings.  They are due the end of

always seem to need more time.Sheri,

I need the trade date so I know what to date the termination.I sent the documents to Paul Davis on March 6.Yeah!Per my conversation a minute ago with the Koch lawyer in Kansas, Tye Darland, 
"Koch Hydrocarbons, Inc." is a bad name.  The correct legal name for this 
counterparty should be the same as it is set up in our Master Swap Agreement 
database:  "Koch Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon 
Company Division".  I have called the Koch trader, James "Doug" Peters 
(713/544-5938, ext. 5602) , and asked him to resubmit the Password 
Application with the name corrected.  Please show this correction in your 
records as well.Please take me off your distribution.  I already bought my new car.  Thank 
youl.I understand from Mark that in order to open up the utilities to trade 
financial, we will need to amend the GTC's to add some additional reps and 
provisions.  Do you have a timetable for when we will be able to do that?---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 03/14/2000 05:12 PM

Regards,

Did you forget something in your email?Several things are not very clear to me and I need to run them by you.

1.  From your email it appears to me that there would be no legal reason 
prohibiting your Australian based counterparties from trading all of the 
products we offer, however, except for financial Australian power, the 
contracting Enron entity will have to be the party referenced on the 
particular product.  It appears that the only product Credit has currently 
opened the Australian based counterparties to trade anyway is Australian 
financial power.

2.  Will you be approving the Australian based counterparties for trading?   
Dave Forster appears to want me to approve Australian based counterparties 
too, which doesn't make sense to me and Mark Taylor.  What are your thoughts 
on this? I guess EnronOnline just does not want a third Legal contract they 
are going to have to deal with on an ongoing basis.  FYI,  I currently do not 
approve the London based counterparties.

3.  The Australian company number.  Does that have to go on every 
confirmation done with an Australian counterparty?  If it does we will need 
to make sure that it gets put on every confirmation.  It is my understanding 
that the confirmations for online trading will be generated from Houston so 
we will have to provide every company number to the Houston Confirmation Desk.

FYI, tomorrow at the end of the day is my drop dead time to get all the 
counterparies approved, because the information will have to be loaded in by 
London when they arrive for work Friday morning.As you may or may not be aware of, tomorrow is the drop dead date for 
approval of the referenced new product for our existing approved counterparty 
list.  Thinking through this product today and reading through my various 
emails from David Minns, I have come to the conclusion that there are no 
particular issues specifically relating to Australian financial power, and my 
thinking is to just mirror the approval for some other previously approved 
financial power product.  I can't, obviously, speak for you, but it seems to 
me that that should work for your counterparty lists too.  What do you think?

The list I am working off of is the list generated for Credit Derivative 
approvals (which is the most somewhat current list of counterparties who have 
been issued passwords).Mark Taylor, who is in Amsterdam this week, just left me a voicemail 
reflecting a conversation he just had with Dave Forster, and asked me to 
relay the following information to you (don't kill me, I'm just the 
messenger)...

With respect to your form of online GTC:

It need to be revised, per Dave Forster by Monday, to be expanded to include 
the provisions necessary that will enable a non-Australian based counterparty 
(a counterparty could be U.S., Canadian, European or other country based), 
who may or may not have an ISDA Master Agreement in place, and may or may not 
have credit in place, to do a financial power transaction with Enron 
Australia.  In that regard I am attaching as a template, our form of online 
"Deemed ISDA" GTC (for a weather transaction, the only type of financial 
transaction where we adopt the ISDA documentation instead of using our own 
form of confirmation). 

As you can see when you look at our "Deemed ISDA" form of confirmation, there 
are a number of provisions that our Deemed ISDA form of confirmation 
includes, such as authority and tax representations, "arm's length 
transaction" reps, acting as a principal rep, the deletion of section 
2(c)(ii) of the ISDA Schedule (netting "in respect of the same transaction"), 
no language that each party has a copy of the ISDA form and has read it and 
understands it, your deletion of language re: written confirmations, 
definition of "Transaction" meaning the GTC+ISDA form+website terms, 
"Website" (uppercased) is a defined term under the Password Application, we 
usually say "Loss" instead of "Market Quotation", also,  Market Quotation and 
Second Method will apply for the purposes of Section 6(e), a question, do we 
need the word "integrated" with respect to the rerenced that the documents 
contain a "single agreement" to fall under the U.S. bankruptcy swap 
protection?, no ducment conflict provisions, missing our "severability" and 
"setoff" language, no adoption of the 1991 or 1993 Commodity definitions, 
business day defined as Sydney only, etc.

Of course, you do not have these in your form of GTC, because they are or 
will be covered in your executed ISDA Master Agreement, but it is likely 
counterparties outside of Australia may not have a master swap agreement in 
place.

I spoke to Steve Douglas in Tax, who is out of town today and was going to 
talk to Susan Musch about the tax issues and I hope to hear from him tomorrow.

After all the above, I just have to say...we really do appreciate your help 
resolving all these issues...


Debbie,

Subject: Online Trading Australian Financial Power GTC

Mark Taylor, who is in Amsterdam this week, just left me a voicemail 
reflecting a conversation he just had with Dave Forster, and asked me to 
relay the following information to you (don't kill me, I'm just the 
messenger)...

With respect to your form of online GTC:

It need to be revised, per Dave Forster by Monday, to be expanded to include 
the provisions necessary that will enable a non-Australian based counterparty 
(a counterparty could be U.S., Canadian, European or other country based), 
who may or may not have an ISDA Master Agreement in place, and may or may not 
have credit in place, to do a financial power transaction with Enron 
Australia.  In that regard I am attaching as a template, our form of online 
"Deemed ISDA" GTC (for a weather transaction, the only type of financial 
transaction where we adopt the ISDA documentation instead of using our own 
form of confirmation). 

As you can see when you look at our "Deemed ISDA" form of confirmation, there 
are a number of provisions that our Deemed ISDA form of confirmation 
includes, such as authority and tax representations, "arm's length 
transaction" reps, acting as a principal rep, the deletion of section 
2(c)(ii) of the ISDA Schedule (netting "in respect of the same transaction"), 
no language that each party has a copy of the ISDA form and has read it and 
understands it, your deletion of language re: written confirmations, 
definition of "Transaction" meaning the GTC+ISDA form+website terms, 
"Website" (uppercased) is a defined term under the Password Application, we 
usually say "Loss" instead of "Market Quotation", also,  Market Quotation and 
Second Method will apply for the purposes of Section 6(e), a question, do we 
need the word "integrated" with respect to the rerenced that the documents 
contain a "single agreement" to fall under the U.S. bankruptcy swap 
protection?, no ducment conflict provisions, missing our "severability" and 
"setoff" language, no adoption of the 1991 or 1993 Commodity definitions, 
business day defined as Sydney only, etc.

Of course, you do not have these in your form of GTC, because they are or 
will be covered in your executed ISDA Master Agreement, but it is likely 
counterparties outside of Australia may not have a master swap agreement in 
place.

I spoke to Steve Douglas in Tax, who is out of town today and was going to 
talk to Susan Musch about the tax issues and I hope to hear from him tomorrow.

After all the above, I just have to say...we really do appreciate your help 
resolving all these issues...




Actually, bluebonnets bloom for a short time, maybe three week early in the 
Houston Spring, in March, after heavy Spring rains have gone on for a bit, 
and when the temperature is in the 60's to 70's.  They would get fried and 
fade in the heat of a Houston summer.  However, I don't know the temperatures 
and rain condition of your summers, and what time of your year would 
replicate those conditions.Per an earlier conveersation with Dave, ee weren't quite sure if you have 
seen a listing yet of all of the products we offer online, so I am sending 
you one of our excel spreadsheets which has at the top of it all of the 
products we offer, as well as the Enron entity that a counterparty would 
enter into the trade with.

Subject: Online Approvals- Australian Power



The attached spreadsheet contains the Online counterparties with execute IDs 
that Credit has tentatively approved for Autralian power trading, pending the 
confirmation of the European counterparties by our London credit group. 

This approval is contingent on the confirmation by our Australian counsel of 
the "specific criteria" which regulates with whom we can trade  and the 
proper forms of GTC and confirmation. 


Attached is the list reflecting the approval of the initial Australian 
counterparties to trade Australian financial power only.  David Minns will 
have to get back to us about all the other products!

For the current U.S. list of counterparties, just mirror the approvals for 
"US Power Financial Swaps".

I will review the list Debbie is sending me tomorrow to see if any of her 
approvals conflicts with my earlier approvals, but I think we should be fine.

Thanks for returning my message.  I had an Australian issue come up and 
anyone who was familiar with Australian law was unreachable and I was in an 
absolute panic.  But as things usually do, this problem worked itself out too!

As usual, I am always humbly in your debt...I have developed a database in which I keep track of the counterparties Legal 
has approved, any supporting rationale for approval of each counterparty (I 
'm giving away my secret that I just don't approve them on on pure whim!) and 
the products such counterparties are approved to trade.  Additionally, at the 
bottom of each entry there is a listing of any amendment to the Password 
Application, ETA , GTC, or any other online documentation.

The information for the financial products is pretty accurate (I may have 
missed an entry here or there in trying to enter 6 months of memos and excel 
spreadsheets.  If I have missed a counterparty let me know).  The information 
for Power has been updated only since this database was in production, about 
6-7 weeks ago.  I am going to have to go back and input the power data from 
the original approval lists.

As for gas trading and emerging products, we have never yet had a 
counterparty that we have had an issue with, so no information has been 
entered for those products. You should count them as being approved for 
everything.  Eventually, if we continue not to use those dropdowns, I will 
delete them.

I don't know if you will find this information helpful or not, take a look 
and I will be glad to hear any input.  Obviously, we are all working out the 
kinks and finding out what is useful and what is not useful as we go along, 
so this database may evolve over time.

The only people who should have change access are the Legal team (Mike 
Neves:  Mark Taylor, Carol St Clair, Leslie Hansen, Marie Heard and myself).  
Let me know if you have change access by mistake.

On a closing note, please try to keep the information in the database 
confidential to the group we have granted view access to. Do not forward this 
email on to anyone as it will grant access without my approval.  Much 
thanks!   
I would like to take responsibility for the technical side of this, but in 
all honesty I must admit I'm just the idea guy...(I'm know I'm breaking all 
your illusions about me today, I'll have no more secrets!)---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 03/17/2000 05:59 PM

1.  Per my discussion last week with David Minns, I sent him a spreadsheet so 
he could scroll across the product list and see the full range of products 
EnronOnline offers so he could determine whether an Australian based 
counterparty will have any legal problems entering into any of the 
EnronOnline products.  It was my understanding that he had not seen a 
comprehensive list off all the products we offer.

2.  However, on a going forward basis, David Minns or someone in Legal will 
need to see the daily spreadsheets reflecting any new Australian based 
counterparties because every new counterparty requesting a password needs a 
Credit and a Legal signoff for trading every products we offer, whether 
physical, financial, power, gas, liquids, weather, p&p, US, European or other 
country based product, etc..  Houston Legal does it every day for every new 
Houston Credit based counterparty, London Legal does it every day for every 
new London Credit based counterparty and Australian Legal will need to do the 
same.  If some other system will be in place in Australia, David Minns will 
need to discuss that with Mark Taylor and David Forster.Please find attached referenced lists.  It is not clear to me yet how we are 
going to deal with Australian approvals, so I think at this point you need to 
look to Australia for approval of their counterparties.  Also, there were no 
counterparties to approve on 3/16/00 so that list is not attached.

I haven't said it in a while...but no European power for US counterparties...


I'm working on the Merrill/Belco assignment of trades with, I guess, Sara.  
Mark Taylor signed off yesterday on the assignment that appears to again have 
been executed by Fred without Legal's initials.  It appears the date Fred 
signed it is about the time Mark Taylor talked to him about not signing 
contractual documents without Legal's initials.

There appears to be two differences in the redone confirms Merrill sent us:  
(1)  they added a Fallback Reference Price, and (2) they have changed the 
settlement and/or payment dates in the confirms.

Bernice said Sara signed off on a similar Fallback Reference Price in some 
confirms she had previously done with Merrill, so I briefly discussed this 
with Sara before she had to leave for lunch.  We'll look at it some more 
after lunch.

On the change in the settlement/payment dates, I told Bernice they were 
changing the deal and she needed the business guy on the transactions to sign 
off on that change.  She was going to take the confirms to Fred and get him 
to sign off that that is what he's agreed to.

Now, if Sara doesn't know anything about the additional Fallback Reference 
Price, we'll obviously have to take that back to the dealmaker to sign off on 
too.

Are you also working on this?

So that's what's going on...Mark,

I discussed this issue Friday with Paul, however, since it is an issue I am 
not entirely knowledgeable about, I think Paul should run this by you...

Tana,

As a follow up to Friday's discoveries, on the commodities side, it appears 
as though the agencies which regulate the commodity exchanges drive the rules 
regarding safeguarding of client accounts.  Other than 1) the US exchanges 
(which are all governed by the CFTC), and  2) the OMLX, and the IPE (which we 
have already addressed),  what are the other exchanges whose contracts we 
trade?  

Thanks

Lou,

I left Mark Tawney a voicemail to call me re: the ISDA sample form.  I'll 
need to know a little bit more about the company so I send them the right 
form.The NYMEX has approved all of your applications and you should all have 
access to the system and be able to trade (everyone except Dana Davis, who 
still needs to complete his training).  Please let me know if you cannot log 
in.  I spoke to the NYMEX a minute ago and there is no reason from their 
perspective why you should not be able to log in.I have tried to call him directly but he was not available.Yes, I left him a voicemail telling him I needed to know a little more about 
the counterparty so I could make sure i send them the right form (are they US 
or non-US counterparty, insurance company, energy company, etc).  Also, the 
name and address of his contact and I will send it directly if he would 
prefer that.---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 03/21/2000 11:47 AM

Subject: EnronOnline Procedures

Due to people being out of the office today we were not able to finalise a 
response concerning  procedures to enable us to approve potential 
counterparties to trade Australian Power Derivatives. This would include 
arrangements to cover both counterparties  with a presence in Australia and 
those that do not. In the case of the later group I believe we can come up 
with a set of procedures to address credit, tax, regulatory and settlement 
requirements.    As I mentioned this morning Sydney is the first "satellite 
office" to introduce EnronOnline. I would hope we can develop procedures that 
are robust enough to be used as a template by other Enron offices. 

 I suspect tomorrow will also be a fairly demanding day with the press coming 
in for the launching of EnronOnline and a number of us heading down to 
Adelaide for Project Taipan. However settling this issue is major priority 
for us.

We also spoke about procedures to approve  Australian incorporated 
counterparties who seek access to other Enron products. I confirm that Tana 
will be forwarding details of them to me for legal clearance. I will arrange 
procedures to discharge this function when I am out of the office as a 24 
hour turn around is required.      


Now might be your time to plant!

I'm already miserable with the Houston summer heat.  It's already in the high 
90's with high 90 humidity.  After 4-5 more months of this it's going to get 
pretty old!

How's little Sophie.  Any new cute things she's doing you need to tell me 
about?Linda and I had a good visit Sunday for about six hours.  We had a nice lunch 
at an outdoor cafe, went shopping in the Village, and then went back to my 
house for a chat.  Linda had pictures of Jenny.  She is a beautiful 14 year 
old, blond like Linda but with Tim's dark eyes and full eyebrows.  She was 
voted the #1 girl in an underground survey done by the boys in her class, and 
Linda was a little concerned about that because Jenny is a little developed 
for her age group and she's afraid the boys interest is a little prurient.  
Her marriage is going well despite Steve's current unemployed status.  But 
she is doing well in her job, they moved into a bigger house and Tim bought 
her old one, and all in all is at a very good place in her life. 

I'm getting ready to leave for New Orleans tomorrow for our Legal 
Conference.  We have dinner reservations at Emeril's for 9:00 tomorrow night 
and we're all a bit excited about that.  Then Thursday night is our big night 
out at a blues club.

This email was a good idea.  Linda got my address and I hope to be chatting 
with her more than every two years!  I'll be in touch when I get back.   All 
my love, We discussed your training in our group meeting yesterday, and Mark gave me 
the go ahead to do a training, preferably a lunch training, sometime in 
April.  If you could get together with the members of our team and send me an 
email of any items in particular you would like addressed, we will try to 
address them in our training.  Also, if you could get some dates for me we'll 
check them against our schedule.  Would your group organize this lunch or 
ours?  How many people are we talking about.  Only Global Contract or Global 
Counterparty too?  Let me know the details so we can start planning...Per my discussions with Leslie Hansen and Dave Forster, please restrict 
Australian based counterparties from trading US physical power on a going 
forward basis.  To the best of our knowledge, no Australian based 
counterparty has been granted a FERC license to trade physical US power.  
This situation, of course, can change if a counterparty were to provide us 
evidence of their FERC licensing.On the list for 3/20/00, the only counterparty I am responding for is 
Carthage Energy.  Eventually I will be making the Australian responses, but 
we are not there yet.

On the 3/21/00 list, National Energy was amended, and I had no changes to my 
previous approvals.  Western Resources is an amended counterparty and I am 
opening them up for all financial and power.


I spoke to Harry Collins, one of our emissions lawyers, and he said there 
should be no problem trading emissions with a governmental entity on the 
emissions auction website, as long as they can trade emissions generally.  If 
you have any specific questions, call Harry Collins at x39692.---------------------- Forwarded by Tana Jones/HOU/ECT on 03/23/2000 08:52 AM

We have received the following executed Master Agreement:

NOTE:   This master appears to have been signed in 1996 and didn't make its 
way down to Houston until now.

Type of Contract: Master Agreement (ECT Canada Form)

Effective Date:  06/16/95

Executed Date:  06/24/96

Enron Entity:  Enron Capital and Trade Resources Canada Corp., now known as 
Enron Canada Corp.

Counterparty:  Originally, NOVAGAS CLEARINGHOUSE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, now 
through name changes and merger, DYNEGY CANADA INC.

Transactions Covered: Energy price swaps or option transactions only (no pulp 
& paper, weather, interest rate & currency or FX)

GLOBAL CONTRACTS:  We need to get this master inputted immediately into the 
EnronOnline System so all of the confirmations for ENA and ECC will 
immediately roll up under this master.

CONFIRM DESK:  Please immediately start rolling up all the ENA and ECC trades 
under this master, whether online, offline, or brokered trades. 
Novagas has a long and tortured history...when you've got a few hours and 
want to be incredibly bored I'll share it with you.  Let's just say that 
Canada has been the only one aware of this signed master.  You can quote my 
somewhat eloquent words "if it ain't in Legal it ain't!"You have been getting the excel spreadsheets on new counterparties now for 
several days, and at an agreed time I would like to include your approvals in 
with the rest of Legal's.  Right now I am still telling the EnronOnline 
people that they have to look to Australia for approvals.  Once we are in 
agreement about the parameters of my responses, and who your backup is, we 
can agree on a date when I will start responding for Australia too.  The 
theory will be that once I send you the email you will have 24 hours to 
respond or I will consider all the online products approved for Ausralian 
counterparties.  Because of the time change issue, I think we need to make 
the time my approval will go out 4:00 p.m. the next day (which will be your 
morning) from the transmittal of the list.In connection with an internal audit regarding the safekeeping of margin 
funds and securities, Enron Corp. has asked us to provide them with a list of 
all the exchanges we trade on, what rules govern those exchanges and the 
products we trade on them (in particular the clearing arrangements), and any 
rules that govern brokers we may maintain funds or cash with.  This should 
include all the products we may trade/hedge over an exchange including energy 
commodities, interest rates, currencies, equities, etc.

Can you please provide this information no later than Friday of next week.  
Much thanks!Per my conversation with Kathy Bolan at PG&E Energy Trading, Canada 
Corporation (and my confirmation thereof with Messrs. Suttle and Bowen), all 
cross-border trades between PG&E Canada and ENA should go under the master 
between PG&E Canada and ECC.I have been given the name of your company by a consultant we have hired to 
advise us on sofware systems to manage our physical and financial 
confirmation process and ISDA Master Agreements.  I have also seen 
information on your company in the January 1999 issue of Risk Magazine.  I am 
a Senior Legal Specialist in the Legal Dept. and am looking at software 
systems that can help us manage our documentation needs.

If you are unfamiliar with our company,  Enron is the largest integrated 
marketer of energy in the United States.  We have a Web Page located at 
www.enron.com.  Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. is the marketing 
affiliate of our parent, Enron Corp.

I would like to obtain marketing material about the services you provide, and 
after I have a chance to look at the information, would like to talk to you 
or a representative from you company in some depth.  I am located in Houston, 
Texas and my phone number is (713) 853-3399.  Thank your for your attention 
herewith.We have received the fully executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement 
dated as of December 1, 1999 between ECC and the referenced counterparty.  
This First Amendment adds the British Columbia Securities representation to 
the ISDA Master Agreement. 

Confirm Desk:  You no longer have to add this representation to every 
confirmation.I have not started responding for Australia yet.

Entergy Power Marketing Corp. has applied for a Password and has asked us to 
give them a "comfort letter" stating that the current trading with them will 
go under the respective master for the product and not the online GTC.  I 
have spoken to Credit and we are trading financial gas, physical gas, and 
physical power (through EPMI).  Can you please let me know first, if you have 
a master agreement agreement in place with this counterparty would it govern 
the product or would we need to use an override letter and if the master 
agreement will govern the trades, please provide me the exact name, parties 
and date of the contract.  Obviously, as usual with online matters, this is a 
RUSH.





Mr. Holtz,

At the request of Fred Lagrasta, I am enclosing a sample copy of the 
referenced Master Agreement.  This agreement is subject to Legal and Credit 
review of the counterparty.  If you have any comments or questions, please do 
not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399 or Fred at (713) 853-6529.  We look 
forward to hearing from you.




Tana Jones
Sr. Legal SpecialistCan you add the referenced counterparty to the next list.  We got a signed 
master agreement in place with them and I need to change the approvals.  
Thanks.Can you please add the new credit person below for full edit priviliges to 
the Financial Trading Agreement  database.  Much thanks!

I am flying, are you?  If you are on my flight I would be happy to have you 
drive to the airport with me.  If you need to know my reservations, I can 
email them to you.Is everything OK?Mark said you would know who it is in London that prepared a "script" for 
your traders on what to say on the phone when transacting a deal.  Liz Sager 
is working on some training mid-next week for the power desk traders and 
needs to prepare a similar script for them.  If you could let me know who to 
contact I'd appreciate it.  Thanks for your help!I'm glad to hear that everything is good.  I'm so excited for you, you'll be

XXOOAttached is the proposed form of Confidentiality Agreement with Platt's.
Some notes on the attached lists:

3/24/00 List - the first two counterparties have no Legal changes per my 
earlier approvals.

3/27/00 List-we just got the financial master in signed and they cannot do 
pulp & paper and weather under it.
Ambac Assurance Corp. and Salomon Smith Barney AAA Energy Fund - I have a 
temporary "no" for them for financial products until I get more information 
on them to determine what they are and what they can do.  Per Credit, AMBAC 
only wants to trade credit derivatives, and Salomon Smith Barney is currently 
not an eligible swap participant and cannot trade any financial.  If we get a 
parent guaranty in that can change their eligible swap participant status.  
In the meantime I am trying to get more information on the fund to determine 
what if anything they can do.

3/28/00 List-I previously had them shut down for all financial but am opening 
them up.   I sent an email about that earlier this week.




On this Statoil Trade, I guess this is a physical trade done with ENA.  Can 
you do one of those handy dandy little sheets you do for me so I can attach 
them to my assignment.

I am forever in your debt...

Good Afternoon Tana,

StatOil Energy has performed a deal that they would now like reassigned under 
a new counterparty name - StatOil Energy Services Inc.  I explained to Kara 
Mucha (StatOil contact) that the trades done on EOL were firm and in order to 
actually have this done, an assignment needed to be drafted by legal etc.    

I am forwarding the details on a deal performed on 3/28/00 that needs to be 
reassigned.   Bob Bowen in confirmations explained that we should perform an 
over the counter trade just exactly the opposite  to cancel out the trade and 
then perform the trade over the counter with the right counterparty name.  
However in verifying with our Product Control Group, they suggested I forward 
this information on to you.  

Trade Details:
132184 - 03/28/00  09:47:36AM    Statoil Energy Trading, Inc.

I hope that you will be able to assist or at least direct me in the right 
direction.  Should you need more clarification or have any questions (since I 
have kinda rambled on) please do not hesitate to call me at ext.36283.


Thank You,

Marie and I were just looking at the activities list for the Legal Conference 
and noticed you were signed up to "relax at the resort".  Not to get you 
worked up or anything, but there is a huge outlet mall just outside San 
Antonio, and there would be no shortage of cheap britches to be found!  After 
all, it has been a few years since you cornered the market when you were 
here, and you probably need to keep up with the latest fashions.  (Not to 
belabor a dead horse, but again style watchers are telling us that the 
fashion for Spring and Summer for men will be knee length "pedal pushers".)

We look forward to seeing our favorite Englishman (delete this message after

Subject: EnronOnline procedures and GTCs

Attached are the GTCs that I have revised to address tax issues that would 
arise from counterparties with no Australia presence. I am content settlement 
provisions already covered in the documentation. I have also developed a 
checklist for new counterparties. Would you pass onto Chris Catt at PW for 
his signoff. 

 
I continue to say "no" for financial because they are not an eligible swap 
participant.  For a counterparty to become an eligible swap participant if 
they are not one in their own right, they would have to post an up front 
letter of credit fully covering their trading PRIOR to doing any trades.  So 
this ball is in Credit's court.Per your request...
Sounds good to me!  Saturday, 8:00 am at Buffalo Grille it is!Attached is the referenced Confidentiality Agreement.  I hope to have the 
Fieldston one to you shortly.
Attached please find the referenced agreement.
Per the request of Sara, attached is the form of US online GTC (w/collateral).
We have received notice that the referenced counterparty is updating its 
phone system and is changing all of its phone numbers.  I am sending a copy 
of the notice to the usual distribution.
The list of new phone numbers will be sent to my usual distribution for 
documentation, which includes Connie Sutton from Global Contracts.  As to 
what numbers they are replacing, they are replacing all the phone numbers we 
might have had across the board with this counterparty.  If you would like to 
see the numbers, obtain a copy of the notice from Connie Sutton.  As I just 
mailed it, it should get there in a few days.Per my voicemail, attached is my list of agreements.
What ever happened to that CGAS certificate we were trying to get in 
connection with my swap agreement?  Last note I had was that resolution we 
were trying to get requires approval of Board for each trade and you were 
going to talk to Mark about how to resolve this.  Was it resolved?Per my conversations with Tom and Frank, unless Credit specifically tells us 
that a counterparty is a credit derivatives counterparty, the online team 
should consider that all U.S. based counterparties are not approved to trade 
credit derivatives.  Credit will, in the same box where they put "declined" , 
"amended" or "division", put a note that says "credit derivatives" and in 
those circumstances only you should consider that I will be indicating 
whether or not the counterparty is approved to trade credit derivatives.  
Otherwise, I will not be putting an "X" in the box for each and every 
counterparty to say they can't trade credit derivatives.

I hope this makes sense to you, call me if it doesn't.
There is no change from my previous approvals for the only counterparty on 
the 3/30/00 list, so I am not sending that list.

On the list for 3/31/00, first, David Minns is in the Houston office today, 
so I gave the response today for the one Australian counterparty on this 
list.  We are meeting with Mark on Wednesday to try and figure out the 
approval process for Australia, so maybe after Wednesday I'll start 
responding for them.

Second, on this list please note that there are no counterparties that have 
been indicated as credit derivative counterparties, so none of the 
counterparties on this list should be approved to trade credit derivatives 
(even though I haven't "X'ed" them out).

(Stacy/Debra) stack of non-executed contracts that we (Galye & I) sent up 
last month. It can now be routed to the file room (at least that is one 
'solved' out of the stack). I've forwarded a copy of the letter to Anthony so 
he can take care of the CES ISDA (K#96029703).

She seemed very nice, like she would make a good employee.  I spoke to Liz 
Sager who, although she didn't directly work with her, got report from her 
old law firm of people that did, and Liz said to was extremely well liked, 
and very energetic.  I have a letter on its way to Mike Moscoso right now (interoffice mail).  We 
requested 5000 for nat gas any one month, but were only approved for an 
additional 2000.  So we went from 15,000 to 17,000.

Welcome back!Attached is an updated list of the Confidentiality Agreements. 
Attached please find the referenced lists.  I am not sending the list for 
4/5/00 because all of the counterparties on that list were Credit declines.  
I have responded for Australia Legal on the 4/7/00 list.  Remember, no credit 
derivatives approved unless specifically indicated (which none are).


We do have it signed.  However, the Company's name was not correct in the 
agreement so I spoke to Wayne Greenberg and it said it was okay to go ahead 
and change the name on the C.A. he signed, and I just wanted to get a copy 
back from him initialled by the name change so we have a record of his 
agreement.Bob, can you send me a copy of the EnronOnline confirm so I can prepare 
this.  Thanks!

Subject: Termination on EOL deal

Tana,
Sheri has asked me to send you the following information in order to prepare 
a termination agreement for the following EOL deal.  On Monday, April 10th, 
the day the transaction occurred, Enron had network issues that caused some 
external connection issues. During this time, the customer accidently hit the 
same product twice . I verified that there was 2 exact transactions by the 
noted counterparty.

 We were not aware that our trader let them out of the second transaction 
until late afternoon or else we would of mandated an OTC transaction to net 
out the second EOL transaction. Please call me with any questions.
Thanks!
Jennifer

Are we trading with the referenced counterparty?I have not received any feedback from Edmund or David regarding the email 
below.  Can you please respond as I am getting daily prompts for a response.  
MUCH THANKS!

For Matt, your email stated that you trade over the IPE & NYMEX.  What rules, 
besides the rules of those two exchanges, might apply to any on or off 
exchange trades you might enter into.  For instance, here in the U.S. energy 
commodity trades might be governed by the CFTC, where out equity options 
might be governed by the SEC.  Besides the exchanges your email reflected, 
what other governmental rules or regulations would govern trades you might 
enter into?

Subject: Need Information for Audit

In connection with an internal audit regarding the safekeeping of margin 
funds and securities, Enron Corp. has asked us to provide them with a list of 
all the exchanges we trade on, what rules govern those exchanges and the 
products we trade on them (in particular the clearing arrangements), and any 
rules that govern brokers we may maintain funds or cash with.  This should 
include all the products we may trade/hedge over an exchange including energy 
commodities, interest rates, currencies, equities, etc.

Can you please provide this information no later than Friday of next week.  
Much thanks!
I have not been getting a response from my outside the U.S. attorneys, so I 
just emailed them a reminder again, and tried to make them feel really 
guilty.  I hope that works!Actually, we girls have that built in guilt gene, it just improves with 
age...but do I need to speak to your mother?  Is there anything you would 
like to confess...?What can I say...?!
fax: ( 713) 646-3490David,

What Australian laws besides the rules of the exchange would govern the 
trades?Can you please prepare a print out for us of all the financial masters your 
records reflect and what type of agreement we have executed .  Thanks!FYI,

To date, we have executed 21 amendments to ETA's.We have received the fully executed Confidentiality Agreement from the 
referenced counterparty and I have faxed it to counterparty today.  A copy 
will be sent to Dave.Thanks for your response!

On online, when there are Australian counterparties I will just wait to hear 
from you and include your responses with mine (even tho you will  probably 
tell me they can only trade Australian power!).  Do you have a back up yet?Per Lotus Notes it appears that the above counterparty was acquired by Duke.  
I have sitting in my files the originals of both theirs and our guarantees.  
Do we want to keep these in place, mutually cancel them or what?  We sent 
execution documents to the counterparty and never heard back and put it on 
the inactive status.We have received the executed Termination Agreement dated as of April 10, 
2000 terminating the referenced trade.  Per the request of Jennifer de 
Boisblanc Denny, this termination was prepared because the customer hit the 
same product twice on EOL and two exact transactions were entered into the 
system.  I will send the original (fax) down to Bob Bowen for handling.Attached is the referenced agreement.  Please do not hesitate to call me if I 
can be of any further assistance.  I am a paralegal in the Legal Dept.  My 
direct phone no is (713) 853-3399.
Mike,

Could you add two new categories of products to the database for me.  That 
would include the "Yes, Yes with Limits, and No" buttons and also a comment 
screen for the new products.

The two new products are:  Credit Derivatives and Bandwidth

Thanks!

By the way, I can't figure out how to move the Portland masters off the 
master swap list.  I think I am going to need your help with that.
will someone be sending us the report?I look forward to seeing you!  As soon as I get the recipes, I'll forward 
them on!Who is Legal requested the master?Carol St. Clair had her assistant reserve EB46C1 on May 24 from 11:30 -2:00 
for our luncheon.  Can you please confirm that that date is good for your 
group and also the total head count.  Suzanne will take care of ordering 
lunch for us.

Thanks!Effective March 1, 2000, Aquila Energy acquired the assets of USGT (U.S. Gas 
Transportation Inc.) , with the acquiring entity being USGT/Aquila L.P.  USGT 
has assigned the Electronic Trading Agreement it executed with ENA to 
USGT/Aquila L.P.  A copy of the assignment will be forwarded to Frank Davis.That envelope should probably go to Rob Milnthorp.  I'll have a copy walked 
down to John Lavorato here.  It is a list of all of our NYMEX positions, and 
the list should be provided by Rob to any traders trading NYMEX out of 
Canada.Oops, what a surprise!  When I went to file away my file on the CFTC Form 40, 
I noticed I already had a file in the regulatory cabinet where where had 
filed the form in 1995 and 1997.  Maybe we have to file these every other 
year?I have nothing but the counterparty's request for assignment.We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement with the referenced 
counterparty dated April 12, 2000.  A copy will be sent to Dave Samuels.Attached please find the referenced list.  For Tosco Refining Company, it 
should be set up as Tosco Refining Company, a division of Tosco Corporation.  
We need to get the incorporated entity on the hook.
There is an Australian counterparty on today's list.No conflict with me.  I sent the date of the 24th to Anthony and asked him to 
confirm it with his people and get back to me.Per our conversation, attached is the form of Amendment to the ETA, revised 
to reflect your correct name.  Also, while I was revising the document, I 
added today's date, and the page number and footer reflecting the document 
name.

Call me again at (713) 853-399 if you have any more questions, otherwise, I 
will await your fax of the signed amendment and bring it to one of our 
officers for signature.
Can you please add David Minns, a lawyer from our Australia office as an 
auhorized person with full privileges to the Master Swap Agreement Database 
(of course, only I should have keyword change and deletion ability).tana jones will attendIs your counterparty on today's list approved?Edmund,

You are the only person I have now not heard from.  When can I expect to get 
your response?

Probably cancel them as Duke is clsoing these operations and assigning all 
trades to Duke. Talk to Tracy as NP has always been more of a Power 
counterparty, and she is the Duke expert.

Per my voicemail, the attached confirm is still a moving target with the tax
