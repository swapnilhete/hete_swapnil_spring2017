Subject: Re: TW acquisition of capacity on PNM

I found the reference I was remembering over the weekend.  Check out the 
order issued to TriState Pipeline at Docket CP99-61.  FERC got all over CMS 
on the problems posed by "dual jurisdictional facilities" whatever that 
means.  CMS tried to do something that sounds a lot like what PNM would be 
doing under the idea you guys had.

Subject: Re: TW acquisition of capacity on PNM  

Interesting.  Assuming we could satisfy the Texas Eastern criteria (which 
would be tough given that this is a firm service, unlike our market center 
service), we still need to think about PNM's situation.  The letter says they 
are a Hinshaw.  This deal would seem to blow their Hinshaw exemption.  There 
is some new law on use of capacity on a Hinshaw for interstate service, only 
I think it involved a capacity lease instead of service agreements.   I think 
it was one of the Northeast pipeline cases involving CMS.  Does PNM know that 
we would use their service for interstate transportation?  If we can crack 
the Hinshaw issue, this might be worth a shot.  DF

Subject: TW acquisition of capacity on PNM

The Commercial Group has been discussing with PNM the possibility of entering 
into service agreements for firm capacity on the portion of PNM's system 
between Blanco and Rio Puerco.  This would effectively operate as an 
expansion of TW's system from the San Juan Basin to the mainline.  TW would 
acquire PNM capacity then post it as available on the EBB just like we post 
other capacity.  Shippers could then use the capacity to transport gas from 
Blanco to any point on TW's system.   The capacity that PNM has available at 
this time is seasonal (summer months) only, so it would be used to provide 
short-term firm capacity or LFT to TW customers.   The marketers anticipate 
that the additional capacity would mostly be used to ship gas to points on 
TW's mainline besides Rio Puerco -- in other words, the total path used by 
shippers would be a combination of PNM's system and TW's system.  Shippers 
wouldn't necessarily know whether PNM capacity was being used to provide 
service on their contract, only that their gas is being shipped from A to B.  

In re-reading the Texas Eastern line of cases, I believe we can distinguish 
TW's proposal from that in Northern's Docket No. 97-388 because it is more 
specific (we are asking for authority to acquire capacity on a specific 
pipeline) and because it is more in the nature of an expansion of TW's 
constrained San Juan lateral rather than a proposal to broker other 
pipelines' capacity.  I may be overly optimistic, but I also believe we meet 
all the Texas Eastern criteria.

I realize that I have not discussed this very extensively (or at all) with 
any of you, but I have gone ahead and drafted the proposal in the form of a 
letter to FERC.  It seemed the most efficient way to provide a starting point 
for discussion, especially since I was able to borrow heavily from our 
successful Market Center Services filing.  I'm not yet sure where we will 
include it in the tariff, but I propose tariff language along the lines of   
"Transporter may contract for firm transportation service on Public Service 
Company of New Mexico for use in providing transportation service from the 
Blanco receipt point on Transporter's system.  The cost incurred for 
acquisition of any such services shall be separately recorded in Account No. 
___.  Transporter is at risk for recovery of costs associated with such 
services."

After you've reviewed the attached, please let me know your overall 
substantive comments and let's talk about the best way to proceed.  Thanks.












Jeff, here are Colleen's comments.  At your convenience, let's meet to 
discuss.

Subject: Calpine/ TW Measurement and Control Facilities Operating Agreement

Attached is a black-lined version of my redraft of certain provisions of the 
3/03/00 draft of the above Agreement.  The purpose of my changes was to (i) 
apportion the risk assumed by TW and Calpine based on the economic benefits 
realized by the parties and the ability of a party to insure against the 
risk, and (ii) to clearly identify the parts of the facilities to be serviced 
by TW and the list of services routinely performed.  I noticed that there is 
no insurance  coverage  required of either Party.  I expect that Calpine 
insures its property against casualties and is therefore in the best position 
to assume the risk of loss or damage to its property.   On the other-hand, 
third party property that is in the care, custody and control of TW while it 
performs its work, is not covered by Enron's standard general liability 
policies.  Builder's risk  coverage must be purchased to cover this risk; the 
coverage is expensive.  Section 5.4 and Section 4.1 reflect this reasoning. 

If TW plans to limit its financial responsibility to the amount of money 
collected by Customer from TW's insurance carriers, then an Insurance section 
should be included, and the penultimate sentence of Section 5.4 further 
edited to stipulate that limitation.  If TW's limitation of liability is to 
be a percentage of the total amount of revenues and compensation it receives 
under this transaction, then that dollar-amount should be inserted in the 
latter mentioned sentence of Section 5.4.

Please contact me if you have any questions about my changes.



Attached for your information is a summary of other parties' requests for 
rehearing of Order 637.  I will be happy to answer any questions you might 
have.

The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into 
discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.  The 
standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that 
the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement 
renews, but not beyond a specified date.  Typically TW enters into these 
discount letters for a term of one month.  The marketers say that they were 
once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than 
a 3-month term.   I see no basis for this limitation.  The term of the FTS-1 
agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.  The discount is only 
applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.  If the FTS-1 agreement 
does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.  The basis for the 
shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.  We are not 
guaranteeing a shipper "daily" firm for longer than a one-day term.  The 
discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement 
renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date.
Does this make sense?  I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an 
answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.  Drew and I have 
discussed this and he is on board. Thanks.Jeff, here it is.  Take a look and if you have any questions, I'll be 
prepared to address them promptly so you can send this off.

Subject: Calpine O&M Section 5.4

The attached electronic version of Section 5.4 integrates the changes noted

this opportunity to also divide Section 5.4 into 2 subparagraphs for 
clarity's sake.  I also inserted a new  sentence at the end of subparagraph A 
which was suggested by Enron Risk Management at a meeting I had with them 
yesterday.  I will be adding this insert in the standard Limitation of 
Liabilitysection in the GPG O&M forms of agreement.  Please replace the 
currect section 5.4 in the Calpine O&M with the attached.





Gerald -- here are a couple of suggested wording changes (should appear in 
blue)

 1.  FERC was made aware of the Compression Services arrangement with ECS (at 
that time via Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.) in the filings for the 
certification of the Kachina units.  FERC simply didn't ask any further 
questions in that proceeding.  The Operation & Maintenance Agreements in 
place for the Kachina units essentially accomplishes the same things as the 
Operational Control Agreement in Gallup.  TW feels the O&M agreements would 
be adequate to address any concerns about TW's regulatory responsibility over 
the compressor facilities.  The Operational Control agreement was put into 
place in Gallup because it was thought to be easier to give FERC exactly what 
is was looking for rather than show them the Gallup O&M Agreement which might 
unnecessarily complicate the process at that time.

 2.  There is no basis in FERC Regs or the NGA for FERC to impose any type of 
penalty or discontinue the Compression Service's due to TW's operation of 
Kachina without the Operational Control Agreement.  No regs or law address 
this situation.  Again this is tempered by the fact that FERC was made aware 
of the arrangement and didn't ask any questions and the O&M agreement is in 
place to accomplish control for TW.

 3.  I also faxed you a copy of Section 19(c) of the NGA which indicates that 
the petition for rehearing does not effect the status of the certificate.  
Construction is moving ahead and the anticipated start date is May 1.  

I will forward the filing TW made wrt to the Operational Control Agreement as 
soon as I recieve it.  Let me know if you have any further questions (713) 
853-3512.

Subject: Estimate for Pooling Service on TW  

Lindy,
I agree with Lynn -- not only for the valid reasons she articulated, but 
because I think we may have a conflict of interest here.  You see, 
Transwestern is a formal party to the GIR proceeding.  As such, we are 
currently involved (albeit indirectly) in negotiations with SoCal and other 
parties regarding the ability [and mechanism] for SoCal to recover costs to 
implement unbundled services on their system.  System pooling is one of those 
services.
  
I'll defer to counsel on this, but in my humble opinion, I don't think it 
wise for TW to offer SoCal any kind of cost figure to base its estimates on.  
First, its probably not good form for one party to the proceeding to give 
another party information that could prove to be prejudicial.  Secondly, and 
probably more practically, if Transwestern were of a mind to, it could 
intentionally skew the results of their survey. 

Unless collective wisdom feels differently, I'd suggest we politely decline 
on some reasonably nebulous basis, i.e. --- we don't know... we forgot.... we 
really didn't account for it separately... it's been too long.... the people 
who might have known are no longer here... whatever.   That way we don't 
appear uncooperative, just incompetent!  

I'm kidding.  Just let me know how else I can help here.

As you may be aware, SoCalGas is going through Gas Industry Restructuring.? 
One of our settlement proposals is to provide pooling service.? We have been 
asked to compare our estimate for cost and development time with others who 
have implemented pooling service on their system.? Therefore, if you have a 
ballpark figure of the cost incurred to develop pooling and approximately how 
long it took to build from the time you provided requirements to your 
implementation date, we would appreciate it very much.? If you have any 
questions, you can e-mail me or call me at (213) 24r-3812.

Hi Mum!  No, tickets were hard to come by.  Tried to get some they released a 
couple of weeks ago, but didn't realize everyone would send their secretaries 
and interns downstairs to hold places in line!  I'm sure the VPs will get 
tired of going to the games, and start giving tickets away. 

Tonight is the big CAM gala.  Bill was in trial all week and had no time to 
go shopping, or even to get measured for an ordinary tux rental, so he 
borrowed one from Andre (who owns 4).  Andre is a couple of inches shorter 
than Bill.  Depending on the overall look, I may or may not acknowledge that 
Bill is my date.  My 60's dress I got at Wear It Again Sam looks fabulous.  
It is a sleeveless gown with an empire waist; the top is maroon velvet and 
the rest is very heavy pink satin.  Since it wraps in the back I was able to 
move the hooks over to get it to fit.  Dress was $38 but it cost $35 to get 
it hemmed!  Ann and I were considering asking Mema to do our hair, but I'm 
really going to be pressed for time this afternoon.  Too bad the party is not 
on a Saturday.

Our plans for the rest of this weekend are still up in the air.  What are you 
doing the weekend of the 16th?  Bill has signed up for the MS150 again that 
weekend.  If you are free that weekend why don't I plan to come either Fri. 
or Sat. a.m.  Let me know.

Our law conference begins Thurs. a.m. in San Antonio.  Dot (Staci's boss) is 
having a party at her house on Lake McQueeney on Wednesday, so I'm driving 
Frazier and Tony in the Dentmobile that morning.  We really do have a fun 
group; it should be a good time.  If K&J want company I'll drive over to see 
them on Thurs. night instead of going to the awards dinner, which was a big 
drag last year.  I'll call them this weekend and see what Jim's travel plans 
are.

Today we'll find out about settlement in the California proceeding...this 
will decide whether I will be tied up in hearings for most of May.  Keep your 
fingers crossed!

Hi, Sooz--Big article about the Enron ballpark today--did the company treat
you to the opening?

I'm up to my ears in jobs around the house in preparation for Eric's visit.
It's always a good thing to have company--you get all kinds of things done
you should have done a long time ago.  I painted half of my bedroom last
night, and the other half will have to wait until I decide what to do with
the windows.  But, I needed to paint over the patch on the fireplace wall,
and the holes left by the blinds I took down ages ago.  Didn't know what
color I had used, so I chose a new one.  You can't really tell that I've
stopped at the corners.

Jim is still unsure about his business trip rescheduled and rescheduled for
next week, the 4th and 5th.  I'm hoping it's canceled because Karin asked if
I would come, and that really puts me in a bind with Eric coming in on the
6th as far as cooking, and last minute things.  Sally is coming on the 8th,
so if the trip is postponed until that week, she'll be around.

Are you still going to SA for your continuing ed?

Hope you have a good weekend.  love, mum

See the attached.  Enron Corp. has already authorized Brian Cherry to add 
Enron to the list of parties at the end of the document.  I recommend TW do 
the same.  I propose that we ask Brian to add TW to the list, with a footnote 
that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other 
parts of the term sheet.  (I propose this out of an abundance of caution 
because in one part of the document Brian states the parties have agreed on 
comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the 
parties aren't fully committed yet.)  If he will not agree to do this, then I 
would suggest we leave TW off the list and file a letter with the CPUC along 
the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting 
the motion for extension of time.  Let me know what you think.
Brian:  Transwestern Pipeline Company asks that it be included on list of 
parties to the Motion for Modification of the Procedural Schedule, with the 
following footnote:  Transwestern supports the portions of the settlement 
proposal pertaining to transmission rights, and the designation of primary 
and secondary rights described on Appendix A.  Transwestern does not oppose 
the other parts of the settlement.

Now that two settlement proposals and a motion to extend time have been 
filed, there is no telling what the CPUC will do.  My recommendation is that 
we play it safe and assume we will need to file testimony on April 17.  To 
that end, it's time to review some basics.

In its July 8, 1999 decision, the Commission stated:  "We see reason to 
pursue a change in protocol for receiving gas at Hector Road, even in the 
short term.  If there are burdens that would unfairly fall upon Transwestern 
customers is a window was established at Hector Road, we want to hear about 
it in the next phase of the proceeding.  In addition, we seek specific 
proposals as to how such an arrangement should be defined."

Accordingly, the testimony we file should explain:

1.  The unfair harm that could potentially befall TW customers if Hector Road 
were established as a formal receipt point
2.   Our proposal for making Hector a formal receipt point by establishing 
primary and secondary receipt points
3.  Why our proposal is fair and consistent with Commission policy (here we 
might want to draw analogies to the interstate system and explain why that 
works)

I will also have an opportunity to make legal and policy arguments in a brief 
after testimony has been filed.

Let's discuss how best to go about drafting the testimony.  I think the best 
thing to do would be to outline the testimony, then decide who is going to 
say what.  I'm available after about 2:00 today.
 Not at all!  Fawcett's the antsy one; he is anxious to use his new honorary 
law degree (ahem!).
I agree it would be risky to indicate our wholehearted support of a 
settlement when the agreement has yet to be written.  It would be like giving 
SoCal a signed blank check (that's carte blancheto us lawyers), and we don't 
trust them that much.
Once we've signed a real agreement, I do want to file something in support.  
I'm just trying to plan ahead, is all.

OK, you folks are getting antsy out there.  I haven't yet begun to think 
about a declaration.  And don't plan on thinking about one until 1) the 
Commission has approved the motion, and 2) Socalgas shows during the first 
week or so that it intends to faithfully put into details what it has agreed 
to in principal.  Also, if the motion is approved, the hearing likely won't 
happen on the 11th (one would hope).

Am I missing something?  Are you folks concerned about something that I'm 
missing?

Aurora, I do not think we have estimated the costs for 2000 because what we 
will have to do as far as containment of PCBs this year is the subject of 
some dispute.  I will get you a breakdown of 1999 costs as soon as possible.

Subject: PCB costs incurred (Notes to Browncover Section 7

Susan:

AA auditor reviewed our footnotes to our browncover for TW (Section 7 - 
Litigation and Contingencies) and was asking for some information regarding 
the following paragraph:

Transwestern incurred and continues to incur certain costs related to 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) that migrated into one of its customer's 
facilities through use of a PCB-based lubricant.  Because of the continued 
detection of PCBs near Transwestern's Topock station, Transwestern continues 
to take measures to contain the PCB at an estimated cost of $2.3 million in 
1998 and an estimated $5.4 million in 1999.

Here are the AA's questions:

1) Can you please provide the actual cost for 1999 and the estimated cost for 
2000

2)  Also, if you have a copy of where these costs are coming from so AA can 
tie their figures

Can you please provide this information today as AA wants to wrap up the 
notes.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks again for your help.


Aurora





Do we have an estimate of PCB decontamination costs for 2000?  AA is 
asking...Did Stan make the call to FERC, I wonder.Here is the breakdown of 1999 PCB decontamination costs for TW:

Topock mods   $4,675,000
PG&E sample taps  $     90,000
PG&E filter separator  $   600,000
Remove PG&E filter separator $     10,000

If you need the costs broken down in more detail, or need more information, 
please give me a call at x30596.For the record, I have read Judge Biren's ruling, and contrary to what people 
might have said in the conference call on Friday, it is silent on the topics 
of the testimony schedule and the presentation of arguments.  The 
three-sentence e-mail from Biren simply requests that the parties attend the 
PHC at which time she will rule on the motion, and states that she might 
issue a further ruling prior to the PHC.  I think it is probably fair to 
expect she may solicit brief comments from representatives of the parties at 
the PHC.

Subject: SoCal GIR settlement telecon

I participated in a teleconference today at 3:00 p.m. with several members of 
the "all-party" settlement group.  The ALJ assigned to the GIR case, Andrea 
Biren, has apparently issued a ruling on SoCal's Motion to Extend the 
deadline for filing the all-party settlement.   Although I personally haven't 
seen the document yet, it was the primary focus of the meeting.

According to accounts from the group, Judge Biren's ruling did not grant 
SoCal's motion for extension.  Rather, she will hear arguments on the motion 
during the Prehearing Conference scheduled for Tuesday, April 11.  Judge 
Biren also asked that parties to the proceeding be prepared to file full 
scale testimony discussing all settlement proposals on file as well as offer 
any addtional comments on the most promising options set forth by the 
Commission.  Unfortunately, she is silent on what date the testimony would be 
due (originally, testimony was due on April 17).  In addition, Judge Biren's 
ruling apparently leaves open the possibility that she could be talked into 
something different during Tuesday's prehearing conference (ie. a different 
procedural schedule, or an amended or streamlined testimony filing protocol).

The telecon group decided to do the following: (1) approach CPUC commissioner 
Bilas on Monday and let him know the status of the all-party settlement and 
ask him to intervene in favor of the extension, (2) go before Judge Biren on 
Tuesday (as a group, and individually, if necessary) and request that in leiu 
of a full scale testimony procedure, would she accept a process whereby, 
similar to what was done in the PG&E settlement, parties file declarations in 
favor of one settlement versus another, and then the Judge 
supervises/conducts a panel discussion on the issues surrounding the 
settlement?  If Judge Biren rejects the idea of a less formal process, one 
which arguably doesn't offer as complete a record in the case (which most on 
the call felt was the likely outcome), then would she agree to a schedule 
whereby she grants the SoCal motion, the all-party settlement is filed on 
April 17, then all parties, including the Norm Pedersen group, would have the 
chance to file testimony (only testimony, not additional declarations) 
indicating support of one settlement over another and the reasons/logic, 
including how the settlements meet the Commisision objectives, on or before 
May 5?

As far as the all-party settlement document is concerned, SoCal will be 
forwarding a preliminary (as yet incomplete) draft for the parties to review, 
but not to comment on.  SoCal intends to circulate another, more complete 
version Monday morning for purposes of soliciting comments/changes.  

As far as Transwestern is concerned, I've spoken independently with the team 
-- Susan, Mark and Jeff Dasovich.  Each of us will review and provide TW 
comments to SoCal regarding the settlement document.  Susan will be 
representing TW at the Prehearing Conference on Tuesday.  Mark Baldwin will 
be there also to support Susan's efforts on Tuesday.  Susan and Jeff (and 
maybe Mark?) will try and hook-up Tuesday morning to compare notes and talk 
about the upcoming Commission PHC.

Steve, between Susan and I, we'll continue to forward documentation and other 
materials regarding this case as well as to provide you with our comments 
and/or any drafts of testimony TW intends to file in this case.
 

Shelley -- I'm going to the game but should be back in the office after 5 pm 
today if you want to chat.  x30596.Drew, I'll fax you the information on the "Be a Spokesmodel...or Just Look 
Like One" course they offer here in the Houston office.

Just checking to see if anybody has any comments for me on my draft of the 
petition for waiver, especially as to whether we just file revised procedures 
or the petition.




Interesting.  I seem to remember that under Texas law, everything goes to the 
surviving spouse.  Any community property issues between Greg and ex should 
have been settled in the divorce proceedings.  But it's been a while since I 
looked -- I will ask Bill for a second opinion.  

In any event, a will is a good idea, especially when kids are involved.  If, 
God forbid, the worst should happen, you can bet that ex + kids would make 
life even more difficult for you in what would already be a tough time!  Bill 
doesn't do wills but he could probably recommend someone who would do a will 
for cheap.

Can you ask Bill if he knows anything about wills?  Dena told me that if Greg 
were to die and we didn't have a will, I would get half and his ex would get 
the other half for the kids.  Greg disagrees but this is what Dena was told 
by her lawyer if Curtis were to die.  It's not something I'd like to think 
about, and it's not like we own that much right now anyway, but when we get a 
house, that's a different story.

Thanks

FYI:  This morning, Lorraine and I checked with PNM and surprisingly they do 
not offer any kind of IT transportation service, just firm service.  So our 
final revisions to the cover letter do not include acquiring interruptible

bottle habits.  Pu-lease!  If it's OK with everyone I will try to bring Bill 
at Easter as a distraction.

This weekend I am supposed to drive to Austin to pick up Bill and his friends 
(aka Team Slacker) at the end of the MS 150.  I'll be driving someone's SUV.  
If manners and general treatment of the trainer/driver (by Bill and the owner 
of the SUV) do not improve, however, Team Slacker will be taking the bus home.

Do you remember Rob Carty from high school?  I just saw him at a seminar 
given by Akin Gump for in-house lawyers.  He works for Exxon/Mobil now.  I 
barely recognized him because he has gotten so hefty!

Thought you would enjoy the following brief excerpt from today's Wall Street 
Journal:

***
Big Boy's Adventures in Thailand

With his checkered overalls, cowlick curl and penchant for double-burgers, 
Big Boy seemed an unlikely fit for Bangkok.

"People thought he was a little, well, creepy," says Peter Smythe, the head 
franchiser for Big Boy restaurants in Thailand, dusting off his giant Big Boy 
statue on Bangkok's main thoroughfare.  "They kept asking me, 'Is he a 
Chinese Ronald McDonald?'"  Eventually, a few Thai visitors decided Big Boy 
was a religious icon and laid bowls of rice and incense at his feet.

Take care and drop me a line when you can.

Love,
SoozI'm a man trapped in a woman's body... not really, this is Jeff Fawcett in 
Susan's office.  We're on a conference call with SoCalGas right now talking 
about the settlement document.  Would you guys pull-up the attached file, 
"Primary Rights 4-12.doc" and look it over, with particular reference to the 
section titled, "Scheduling Priority?"  I think we're OK here, but I don't 
want to agree to anything that we can't administer on our side of the meter 
or that just doesn't make sense.

We're down to the final telecon on this subject, and all changes need to be 
sent over to SoCalGas ASAP.  Will you take a quick look and send Susan a note 
saying thumbs up or down?  Thanks a bunch.

Attached is a new version of the Gas Industry Settlement document for  
SoCalGas and SDG&E.? I think that essentially all the terms of the  
settlement in principle are now covered in it.
?
In  addition to adding material, we have made some changes in language in the 
last  version.? Even these changes may not incorporate all comments I have  
received from SoCalGas/SDG&E management.? We have NOT made an attempt  to 
respond to all comments received to date in this version.? If no change  has 
been made on an issue you commented on, that does not necessarily mean we  
agree or disagree with your comment.? 
?
Especially for the new material, there has not yet been final review by  
SoCalGas and SDG&E management either.
?
Hopefully I have been able to correct a problem with the last electronic  
version that cause a lot of the section numbering to go haywire when it was  
emailed and then opened and printed, even though it looked fine on my 
computer  and printed fine from my computer.? Lots of sections mysteriously 
would  renumber themselves as "6.4"
?
I am  also attaching the latest draft of an appendix to be included with the 
full  settlement that is a revised version of the "Primary and Secondary 
Receipt  Point Access Rights" document that was attached with the Deal Points 
in the  April 3 filing.
?

Rob,
Look at the conforming languange in the Appendix "A" last page, last 
paragraph.  You know that this language was negotiated by and between 
SoCalGas and Edison.  My main concern is that its very, very open ended...  
almost a contingent liability for all settlement parties.

Jeffpull out your settlement matrix and see if this SA agrees with that 
document.  I don't necessarily think it does.  Didn't we basically agree to 
disagree and/or deal with this issue outside the settlement process?  Are you 
saying that Edison can reserve capacity in the same manner as Core and 50% of 
noncore, but at the approx. 7.9 cent rate?

HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.... is this language saying that they can convert the 
VALUE of their capacity rights to a capacity contract at the point?  For 
example, if Edison has 200/d at 1 cent Wheeler access fee, they could conver 
it to approx. 25/d at the full 7.9 cent rate?

Let's get clarification!!!

you still there?I'm available Tuesday also -- just let me know.Vanessa, I checked with Bill, and the very unsatisfying answer to your 
question is that it totally depends on how Greg divided the community 
property with his ex.  He agreed with me that a will is a good idea in any 
case because you can arrange things so that you avoid legal proceedings and 
save a lot in taxes!  Our friend Tony Maluski does probate work:  I believe 
his number is 713-228-7401.  He's a nice guy and I believe him to be 
competent; however, I think it is a good idea to shop around when you're 
doing something routine like a will or an uncontested divorce, so I'd advise 
calling several lawyers and see who you like best and who will give you the

See the attached.  The proceeding certainly isn't over, but I think the 
parties have done a great job of submitting a settlement that the Commission 
will eventually approve, provided the parties present sufficient evidence to 
support such a decision.  (Unfortunately, we expect the settlement to be 
protested.)  Direct testimony is due May 5.  To streamline things, the 
parties are going to consolidate efforts and have divided up the testimony by 
topic.  Of course Transwestern got the Hector Road issue.  I plan to put Mr. 
Fawcett on as a witness.  Our issue is not particularly controversial 
anymore, so I do not anticipate rigorous cross-examination; nevertheless, I 
will probably ask your assistance in preparing the witness for the hearing, 
which begins May 30.

Subject: GIR settlement

As you know, approximately one year ago Transwestern first learned of a dark 
cloud looming on the regulatory horizon in California.  The CPUC in its draft 
Order on the Gas Industry Restructuring proceeding in May, 1999 listed, among 
a variety of "promising options," the institution of Mojave's "Hector Road" 
as a commercial receipt point into the SoCalGas system.  In fact, the CPUC 
held in its "Findings of Fact" with regard to Hector Road that:

 - It is unlikely that the market will accurately reflect the value of 
transmission resources if SoCalGas were to define its marketable transmission 
access in a way that did not include the Hector Road facilities, and

 - The failure to provide at least window-style access through Hector Road 
has resulted in lost opportunities for bringing relatively inexpensive gas 
into Southern California.

The basis for the CPUC finding came from testimony taken during the 
proceeding indicating that the use of Hector Road displaces deliveries to the 
constrained delivery point at Wheeler Ridge.  In other words, whatever could 
be delivered by Mojave at Hector Road frees-up space at Wheeler Ridge, a 
delivery point many in the marketplace considered more desirable.

As first articulated by SoCalGas in its draft settlement proposal in the 
summer of 1999, the Hector Road point would be established as a formal 
receipt point into SoCalGas, with rights equal to Transwestern's delivery 
point at North Needles.  With a meter capacity of 200 MMcf/d, and with the 
market's apparent interest in securing additional capacity at Hector Road, 
Transwestern was facing the real possibility of losing up to 200 MMcf/d of 
access rights into SoCalGas at North Needles.  Using an average transport 
rate of $0.25/Mcf, the resulting loss in transport revenues would be $19MM 
per year.

Through months of [seemingly endless] negotiations, and through an 
educational process begun by Transwestern during one of the early settlement 
meetings back in September 1999, Transwestern went from a party with a 
"bullseye" clearly taped on its back, to a party that other stakeholders were 
depending on for a principled solution to these receipt point issues.  As it 
stands now, the Appendix A to the Settlement Agreement, "Primary and 
Secondary Receipt Point Access Rights" is nearly identical to the principles 
outlined by Transwestern in that September settlement meeting.

I only re-state the obvious here to remind the group what their hard work has 
accomplished.  Not only am I proud to see that the resulting Settlement 
Agreement filed with the CPUC today treats Transwestern and its shippers 
equitably, but I'm proud that the work group we cobbled together for this 
effort functioned like a "well oiled machine."

I thank each of you for your efforts to get to this point.  We know we've 
still got a lot of work to do to gain CPUC approval of this document, but no 
matter what happens, we can be proud of what was accomplished here.

Subject: Transwestern Contract Approval Request

TRANSWESTERN CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Please review the provided non-standard discount letter for Duke Energy 
Trading & Marketing.   Duke's 18,000 Dth/d Ignacio to Blanco contract has a 
one year term and a seasonal based 1-part rate structure.  Transportation on 
an alternate basis is provided for on a south to north flow direction at an 
incremental $.01 charge based upon actual utilization of the described path.

Please provide an indication of approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  If any 
questions arise, please contact me at x35702.







As you know, we recently did an east-to-east deal with USGT for 400,000 
MMBtu/day with alternate rights to California 
at a higher rate.  SoCal filed a protest and I'm working on the response.  In 
part, they are alleging that TW is "attempting to exploit a weakness" in the 
GISB procedures to the detriment of existing customers.  For example, under 
TW's tariff (which they concede is GISB compliant), primary firm cannot bump 
alt. firm in cycle 2.  SoCal says this means that any primary shipper 
attempting to deliever to an in-path alt. point will be unable to re-nominate 
to its primary point once this "alternate" capacity [I assume they mean 
USGT's] is confirmed.  According to SoCal this will substantially limit 
shippers' flexibility, including the ability to use market area pooling.  
Once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point 
is defined as an al. delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under 
which it moves.  Thus by manipulating the GISB cycle process, TW and USGT 
will bump firm shippers.

I could really use your help in responding to this argument.  (First of all, 
I'm not sure I even understand it!)  If either of you have a few minutes 
today or tomorrow when we could get together, that would be great.  Also -- 
you two were the first to come to mind, but feel free to refer me to someone 
else in your group if you are swamped.  Please e-mail or call when you get a 
chance...

Hey there, enjoyed hearing about your shopping adventures!  Just a quick note 
to say that Bill will be coming with me this weekend, so Mema will have more 
than enough entertainment.  Tell Jim to bring his tennis gear and if the 
weather cooperates we can play.  He would probably enjoy hitting with Bill.  

Saw Bruce Springsteen last night, even though I'm really not much of a fan.  
Ann really wanted to go, and I knew it would be a good show (which it was).  
He played for 3 hours and needless to say I'm pretty worthless this a.m.

Look forward to seeing you soon.

S.Here it is.  Please let me know your comments today.  Thanks.
Frank and Steve, see the attached.  My theory, which is based on our 
experience with the Gallup compressor, is that we could enter into a joint 
ownership and operating agreement with Agave, and as long as we convince the 
Commission that the agreements give TW sufficient control over the operation 
of the facility to ensure FERC regs are complied with, they will be OK with 
the joint ownership -- and not try to assert jurisdiction over Agave (a 
gathering company).  Although it seems likely that other pipelines have 
entered into such arrangements, I've not found any cases on point here.

Do you agree with my conclusion?  Any other ideas or insights?  Please let me 
know.  Thanks.

Subject: Storage project deal structure

Susan I need some regulatory help in determining some possible deal 
structures.  We are working with Agave to develop a storage facility near the 
West Tx lateral in Eddy County, NM.  My original thought was both parties 
would share in the development costs and own equity interests in the 
facility.  TW would then lease out storage space to shippers plus use storage 
capacity to augment our Park N Ride capability.  The storage would be 
connected via lateral to our W Tx line.

But then it occurred to me how do we share ownership between regulated and 
non-regulated entities?

Do you have some time Friday morning to talk about this?  thanks

Kevin
x35559
Last month Lindy and I began looking into adding a provision to TW's tariff 
allowing shippers to elect to purchase fuel gas from TW.  There is good 
precedent for this and I think it would be fairly easy to accomplish as long 
as we don't try to make the purchase of fuel from TW mandatory (see the 
attached memo).  Mary Kay, as you and I discussed, we will need to address 
the fuel overrecovery issue before moving forward with this. 

 You asked whether current contract approval procedures require the marketers 
to get Legal's approval on all transportation contracts.  The answer is no.  
If you look at the ET&S policy on authority to grant transportation and 
storage discounts (I can fax it to you if you don' t have it), there is a 
column for "Pre-approved Terms" and one for "Non Pre-Approved Terms".  
Contracts that are not on a pre-approved form always have to have the Legal 
Dept's approval.  Contracts on pre-approved forms with a total discount (for 
the entire contract term) of less than $1.2 million do not need Legal's 
approval; those above the threshold do. Does that make sense?  As far as I 
know our marketers have been following this.  I spoke with TK and she is 
aware of the policy, and she is also aware that she needs to show me any 
contract that deviates from our standard language.  She has also discussed 
this with Steve Harris recently to make sure he's comfortable with the 
policy.  

If we need to discuss this further please let me know.Drew, I wanted you to be aware of a potential dispute with regard to our 
consultant, Mark Baldwin of IGS.  Our consulting agreement with IGS (which 
has now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated 
using the net present value of any contract "identified by IGS" and entered 
into during the term of the consulting agreement.  During the term of the 
agreement, TW entered into its Gallup Expansion agreement with Southern.  IGS 
is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive 
fee.  While it is undisputed that Mark discussed the deal with Southern, 
Southern was also on Lorraine's list of shippers to contact for Gallup 
Expansion capacity.  Also, the capacity was posted for all to see.  So, while 
Mark can certainly claim he "identified" the deal, he was not alone in doing 
so. 

Steve is going to call Mark in response to his letter (after he talks to 
Lorraine to verify facts).  Our thinking is that if we offer IGS some money 
they will be happy.  We would really like to preserve what has been a good 
working relationship with this consultant.   On the other hand, I think we 
could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive 
fee.  However, since the contract is silent as to whether IGS has to be the 
only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee, 
this position is not as strong as I'd like it to be, and IGS might sue TW.  
The amount in dispute could be as much as $200,000, depending on what rate we 
use in calculating net present value.

If you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to 
IGS, let me know.  I think it will be very important for Steve not to admit 
that Mark helped in any way in getting the deal -- just in case they do 
decide to take us to court.Jeff, didn't realize everyone else was going to use narrative format.  Now 
that I've had a chance to think about it, I think ours will look silly if 
it's in Q&A format.  I'll work on changing it this evening.

Keith, last week you and I discussed briefly Facilities Planning's proposal 
to change the service factor on the Gallup compressor in order to increase 
capacity.  I believe you had concluded that a certificate application would 
be necessary.  Now Arnold Eisenstein is asking me (thru our commercial 
people) whether we would still have to make a filing if our certificated 
capacity could be increased without any physical modification to the 
compressor -- in other words, through a pressure commitment.  My initial 
impression is yes, we would have to make a filing.  Am I out of my mind?  
Does this make sense?  Please advise.Drew, here's an excerpt from a FERC letter order accepting for filing a 
nonconforming agreement filed 
by Dynegy Midstream...sounds a little bit like what the TW guys are trying to 
do, if I understand the 
concept of volumetric rates correctly.  Left a message for my friend at DMP 
but he (like everyone else)
is out 'til next year.  But since there were no subsequent orders issued in 
the docket I assume there were 
no problems with the filing.

I'm still leaning towards recommending the $0 demand/ $0.02 commodity + file 
as nego. rate approach.
If Steve Harris is OK with the idea of doing a deal that requires filing, I 
will draft something and send it your way.

* * *
The referenced negotiated transaction provides for a transportation service 
under DMP's Rate Schedule
FTS. Rather than paying a reservation charge, the negotiated agreement 
specifies that KGS will pay
a volumetric rate. The volumetric rate will equal DMP's maximum interruptible 
transportation service rate as
set forth in DMP's tariff. . .The contract also (a) specifies five Dth/d as 
KGS' maximum daily reservation 
quantity, (b) lists KGS' primary receipt as Meter # 9999999 and (c) 
identifies five primary delivery points for 
KGS. . . Upon filing Docket No. RP99-240-000, DMP stated that it agreed to 
the above negotiated rate so 
that KGS could serve small residential customers on DMP's system under a firm 
rate schedule.Steve's new idea is to send a letter to Mark asking him to document/explain 
exactly what his role was in getting this deal.  Comments?  Not sure I care 
one way or the other, but after I see how it looks in writing, I'll have a 
better idea of whether this is how we should approach it.

Multi-tasking heavily today.  I'll send you a draft of our PNM answer to 
Dynegy protest by close of business.

Please see the attached and let me know your comments by Wednesday a.m. if 
possible.









Here is the quick & dirty.

None of the Gallup contracts contain a shipper out if the facilities are not 
placed in service by a certain date.  The respective obligations of the 
parties do not commence until the facilities are "tested and placed in 
service."  We notified our shippers by telephone yesterday that the 
facilities were in service.  The compressor has since been taken down because 
of excessive vibration and an unusual whining noise of undetermined origin.  
EE&CC does not know how long it will take to correct the problems; they do 
not have enough information yet to even give an estimate.  Based on our 
experience with Hubbard, it could take months to correct the problem.  Today, 
we've been able to deliver all nominated gas simply because noms did not 
exceed our existing capacity.  Nominations are expected to exceed existing 
capacity this week, in which case we will have to allocate.

Given the uncertainty involved, from a PR standpoint I believe it would be 
best to tell the customers that because of unforeseen circumstances we are 
not in service after all, that we apologize for the mistake and will do our 
best to provide service on a daily or interruptible basis.    When the 
compressor is actually tested and really in service, we'll let them know.  
The downside:  we get no reservation charge at all.  (estimated loss:  
$25,000/month)
The upside:  in the long run we probably save face with our customers.

From a short-term economic standpoint, the better choice appears to be not to 
revoke our "in-service" announcement.  When summer weather kicks in, we'll 
probably have to allocate every day.  On our EBB we will have to give some 
reason for the allocation (or if we don't, shippers will demand an 
explanation anyway).  Shippers' rights to a reservation refund will be 
triggered.  
The downside:  shippers will never trust us again.  Also, we could be subject 
to fraud or related causes of action for representing the compressor was "in 
service" when we knew it was not.  
The upside:  on the off chance no one files a lawsuit and wins, we might at 
least get to keep some of the reservation charges owed us, to the extent 
deliveries don't fall below 75% of nominated quantities for a period of 
longer than 75 days in months other than July and August this summer.  (In 
July and August, we don't get any reservation charge for amounts not 
delivered).  We just need to keep in mind that normally the pipeline runs 
full in the summer months, and Gallup capacity was sold with that assumption 
in mind.

Haven't had time to do a formal write-up; if you want me to turn this into a 
memo for wider distribution, let me know.  For now, I think it's important to 
get a decision on one of the above options.  The longer we wait to get 
information to our shippers, the bigger our customer relations problem will 
be.  Sounds like a great idea -- let us know where/when.FYI

Subject: Gallup - Status Update

The Rolls-Royce vibration engineer has reported that the compressor itself is 
not inducing the abnormal vibration levels on the drive end bearings.  The 
engineer did report that the vibration is high for a new compressor, but not 
harmful to the compressor for the short term.

It is Rolls engineer's opinion that the excessive bearing vibration is due to 
vibrations created by gas flow through the suction strainer.  Rolls will be 
reviewing the gathered vibration data over the next few days to provide any 
further feedback.

TW Ops, via independent tests, has determined that the amplitude of the 
vibration that is eminating from the suction strainer is at a level which 
can, over time, be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of the unit 
piping. 

EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team have discussed the situation and have 
decided to temporarily take the unit out of service to pull the suction 
strainer.  The strainer will be inspected for foreign material or damage.  
The strainer will not be replaced unless some foreign material is found.  It 
is hoped that the removal of the strainer will 'de-tune' the piping system.

EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team all feel that the risk of running 
without the startup strainer is minimized since the unit has been running 
intermittently for the past few days and has accumulated some significant run 
time.  It is expected that  any foreign material in the suction piping should 
have already been caught in the strainer.  Secondly, the station was designed 
with a suction scrubber which will further protect the compressor.

It is expected that the unit will be unavailable until midnight May 4, while 
the startup strainer is removed.  Care must be taken during the 
reinstallation of the piping spool as to not affect the compressor alignment 
or apply stress to the compressor nozzles.

Lorraine:  here's Keith's brief response to your question about increasing 
capacity without changing the service factor or making other mods to the 
Gallup compressor.  Let me know where we need to go from here.  
***
Susan, my understanding is that the capacity west to the California border is 
a certificated amount (1090 MMcf/d).  If in any way we try to change the 
certificated amount of capacity (firm capacity), we will need to file.  TW is 
different than NNG, in that TW certificates capacity rather than facilities.  
Arnold's idea of using a pressure commitment would still require a filing.  
Please let me know, if we need to discuss further.

KeithBummer.  Too bad all of us are captive to Eric's schedule.
Bill and I enjoyed our too-short trip to the GC.  We hiked down Bright Angel 
trail to the second rest stop, which was plenty for me.  It was pretty hot.  
Wish we could have stuck around longer but Bill had to be back for a trial.  
Talk about restrictive travel schedules.  
I was thinking about you and Karin and wanting to take your customary nature 
trips...you know, when Grayson is a little older, we could go on some trips 
and just take turns staying at the hotel/cabin with her while everyone else 
goes hiking/climbing/whatever.  You might have to pay for extra hotel days 
that way, but at least you would get to go.  In the meantime, what about 
staying in one place for a week or so -- a beach house, for example.  Eric 
permitting, I think it would be fun to get everyone together in Florida or 
Colorado sometime within the next year.
My car is ready at the shop.  Yay!
Ciao,
Sus.

Not to complain,but AARRRRRRRRRRGGGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Now that we have canceled our reservations for the cabin at Zion for the end
of October, because Eric's window of opportunity for travel in California
was limited to that specific two week period, and have been on the phone for
a week making earlier arrangements and putting a deposit down, it seems
that, "well, you see there is this car race in Carmel and, well we would
really rather go earlier in the month"

Well we lost the cabin and spent money for accommodations that are not as
good, and that's why we checked before.

Drew, I've attached my proposed changes to the Red Cedar contract.  Our 
beloved Min/Max Language became a bit problematic, as you can see.  I'd 
welcome your comments on this.
Jeff, we only need to send a copy to the Judge electronically.  This is why 
we've only seen a few from the other parties (I'm starting to receive some in 
the mail and will get you copies).  I'll do so promptly.  I'll e-mail one to 
Brian Cherry as well, and to anyone else who specifically requests it.  If 
you would prefer that I send to everyone electronically, let me know.  Copies

Hi Mum!  The trip was pretty exhausting.  Friday we saw Hoover Dam, had lunch 
at a great diner in Kingman (on Route 66!) and rolled into Sedona around 5.  
Climbed around the red rocks of Sedona all day on Saturday, sat by the pool 
in the afternoon and I did some shopping.   Sunday we drove to Grand Canyon 
and did part of the Bright Angel trail.  That was pretty strenuous but 
definitely worth it.  Wish we could have made it a longer trip but we had 
Bill's trial schedule to deal with.  I'll spare you the details of my trip 
home -- suffice it to say I didn't make it back to Houston until about noon 
yesterday and have a $200 travel voucher for my trouble.

I will definitely come to Austin next weekend but probably will not get in 
until later on Saturday.  How about a homemade (by Chef Sooz) brunch on 
Sunday a.m.?

Have to run to a meeting ... for race info, I would try a search for Texaco 
or Texaco Gran(d?) Prix on the Internet.  I know that Texaco probably has it 
on their website.  If you don't find anything let me know.
Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz!

Hope you had a wonderful time in Ariz, saw all kinds of wonderful things, and
didn't fall into the Canyon and expire.  Hope you took a lot of photos.
Can't wait to hear all about it.

I had a good time with Grayson.  Jim and I fed her bottles Sat and Sun, and
she took them without a whimper.  Karin is feeling liberated!  I think she
wants to quit breastfeeding since she is having to pump at the office, and
everytime Grayson misses a feeding from her.  Jim is upset.  She has an ally
in Eric.  He says, men don't know when to stay out of something like that.
Anyway, Grayson is turning out to be a very happy baby.  Everytime you look
at her, she breaks out in a huge smile.

Are you coming next weekend?  K&J are and have made a couple of hc appts.
One is for 6:45 Fri which they fear they won't be able to make.

Trying to get some enthusiasm to pull out all the dead ground cover and plant
something else, but so far, can't seem to get the momentum.  Everything else
is looking pretty good with all our rains.  Except that the shrub people
raped the photinias by the street.  They say they should come back nicely.
We'll see.

Is there someplace you can find info about the car races in Sept?  Eric has a
free ticket he needs to use by Nov 15.  I don't know how this would work with
our CA trip planned for Oct. 3-17.  Had no problem getting a place to stay in
Carmel and we're working out from there.  We'll probably stay in Santa Cruz
about 4 nights so we can do some sailing.

Anxious to hear from you,  love, mum

Subject: Panel Practice Cross Sessions in SFO for GIR




I have scheduled two days of panel practice cross-examination for those 
testifying to the Comprehensive Settlement in the GIR/NGS proceeding.? The 
first, scheduled for May 24, will be held in the Sutter Room A&B of the 
Hilton Hotel (on O'Farrell) in SFO.? The session is scheduled to go from 
9:00AM to 5:00PM.? Lunch will be brought in.? On May 25, we will meet in the 
same room at the Hilton immediately following the PHC that is scheduled for 
10:00AM at the Commission's offices.? This practice cross session will start 
no later than 12Noon and go to 4:00PM.? Lunch will also be available.

I am soliciting feedback from you on how we utilize our time most 
efficiently.? As of today, we have 11 witnesses sponsoring testimony.? Given 
that the majority of testimony is related to capacity matters, I'd like to 
suggest we bifurcate the sessions, devoting May 24 from the hours of 
9:00AM-2:00PM to capacity issues and 2:00PM-5:00PM to the retail panel.? On 
the 25th, we would go from 12Noon-2:30PM on capacity and 2:30-4:00PM on 
retail matters. 

I would also like to suggest that parties work with their respective 
witnesses prior to the panel hearings.? We should concentrate on nailing down 
the substance of our arguments prior to the 24th and then work to reach 
alignment between the various witnesses over the two day practice sessions.? 
After reviewing the draft testimony's over the last few days, I think we are 
going to be in an excellent position to persuasively argue that the 
Comprehensive Settlement resolves all of the Commission's most promising 
options.


We need to start a new "bucket" file called Direct Testimony.  Then please 
watch the mail and do a folder for each prepared testimony as they come in.   
Thank you!Hi there!  I was not able to launch the photo but was able to see it in 
"View" mode on my Lotus Notes.  What a pretty girl!

I assume you'll be in Austin for Mother's Day?  Let me know.  I was thinking 
of cooking brunch if the whole gang is going to be there, but if it is just 
me and Mum maybe we'll just go out.  I have no idea what to buy her!  must do 
some shopping today or tomorrow.

Trivia time:  last night I went to the Astros game with some people from 
work.  One guy brought his girlfriend, Thani-ta, who is from Thailand.  She 
likes to eat at Nit Noi when she is in town!  She told me she has a dog 
called Nit Noi, which means "little bit."  Now you know!

Have a good day; hope to see you in Austin.

What if we replace Section 2 with something like "This Agreement shall 
continue in effect unless and until terminated pursuant to Section 3,"  and 
replace Section 3 with "Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon 
written notice to the other Party not less than twelve (12) months prior to 
the intended date of termination."

Sound OK?  if so I'll add it to my draft.

Section 2 of the original contract, which gives TW the right to extend for 
another five-year term by giving notice to SPS.  If TW does not give such 
notice, SPS may cancel the contract, and if it doesn't, the contract 
automatically rolls over for another year.  If this is not acceptable please 
let me know.

Rich - Dave and I were just discussing whether a period less than 12 months 
would be appropriate (see language below), given that dereg. may bring some 
changes we want to take advantage of.  It's basically your call:  if SPS were 
to terminate our contract, how much time would we need to negotiate a 
replacement?

What if we replace Section 2 with something like "This Agreement shall 
continue in effect unless and until terminated pursuant to Section 3,"  and 
replace Section 3 with "Either Party may terminate this Agreement upon 
written notice to the other Party not less than twelve (12) months prior to 
the intended date of termination."

Sound OK?  if so I'll add it to my draft.

Looks like you nailed the least cost billing provision pretty good.  Just 
need to abrogate our remaining term and make all agreements evergreen.

Hi Brian!  How nice to hear from you.  Congrats on being an uncle.  Scott is 
a good-looking baby!  Yes, I'm pretty psyched about little Grayson; she is a 
sweetie!  Karin and Jim are anxious to give me a refresher course on 
babysitting skills.  I told them that when my niece is old enough to 
understand the command "Go find your shoes and I'll help you put them on," 
I'll be happy to take her off their hands for a weekend!  I too am in no rush 
to have kids.  While my boyfriend is a great guy and loves children, somehow 
I just can't imagine him hanging around the house helping with diapers!

I am so glad you're enjoying Tampa.  Picking up and moving can be a great 
thing sometimes.  I will never regret leaving Austin for Houston.  There is 
just so much here I enjoy doing and my social life is a whole lot better.  
The job is absolutely crazy.  If you ever watch "ER," that is usually what my 
day looks like, only without all the blood!  Here at Enron Gas Pipeline Group 
I work as the only lawyer for a very busy commercial team.  We sit in an open 
work area and it is chaotic every day.  But it's a good crash course in 
business for me, and my clients are wonderful.  

Do take some study breaks and keep in touch!  E-mail is a wonderful thing.

Time to hit the tennis courts.

Love,
Susan

Susan,

Hi, how are you doing? I got your e-mail address from Aunt Sheila. I had
earlier gotten her e-mail address from my Dad and sent her an e-mail after
hearing about Karin giving birth. So how about that! Are you excited about
being an Aunt? I can accept being an uncle much more than being a dad. I am
in no hurry to have kids. Actually, I am in no hurry to get married. I think
I would be  good dad, although I would have to settle down a bit. But that
won't happen anytime soon, as I am enjoying the Tampa area too much. I moved
down here last August and am loving it.

I just got done taking the CPA exam and am scheduled to take the FL Bar exam
in July. So I will not be enjoying FL too much for the next few months. I
just thought I would drop you a line and see how you are doing. How is
Houston? Are you still enjoying it there? How's the job? Have you made
partner yet? Have you seen much of Grayson since her birth? Well enough ?'s,
I have to go. Let me know how you are doing! Take care.

Your cousin,

Brian

Here are my standard rules for my witnesses on examination by opposing 
counsel.  They are worth learning well ahead of time because they can be very 
difficult to follow.  Memorize these and we'll do fine on cross (assuming we 
even get any questions).

1.  Listen carefully to the question.
2.  Answer only that question; do not volunteer more.
3.  If you don't know for sure what the answer is, just say so.
4.  If you cannot answer a "yes" or "no" question with "yes" or "no," say so 
and explain why.
Thought you'd be interested in this.

Hi Mum!  I'm up for birthday celebration this weekend.  Can you believe I 
actually have a gift for Jim already?  I'll try to get there as early as I 
can tomorrow.  Bill will not be coming with me because he has too much work 
piled up, including clients to visit in jail!  My first priority is sleep as 
I have not gotten much this week -- I keep waking up in the middle of the 
night; it's miserable.  To make things worse, I think a ghost has appeared to 
Goo.  She is really freaked out about something, pacing around and acting 
like she hears things.  Gabby is her usual self.

How's the pool?  I'll bring my suit just in case...

Subject: Jim's birthday


Hi, Sooz!

Hope you haven't had to try to play catch-up since returning from your trip.

I was just thinking since we'll all be together this weekend, maybe I'll bake
a birthday cake for Jim.  His birthday is the 20th.  Don't worry about having
to have a gift ready.  I'm not going to give him his gift until next week.  I
haven't heard for sure, but they will probably leave Sat., maybe after
dinner, like before.

Did Karin tell you Grayson had used red paint with her feet in nursery the
other day?!  Karin is wondering what kind of "craft" she made.  It must be
something for Mother's Day!!

High Fidelity, the new John Cusak movie is very good.  Joan is in it as well.

See you soon!  love, mum   p.s. is Bill coming?

I'll just get with Ramona in the a.m. and see when she can meet & we'll go 
from there.Here's a draft of a research memo on options.  While I am hopeful that we can 
overcome FERC's policy on reservation of capacity, our arguments obviously 
need to be developed a little more before we can do that.  I know the 
business folks are anxious to hear our strategy.  I would appreciate your 
comments on the attached.  
Your "courtesy copy" of the draft I sent to MK, Drew and Shelley.  We'll put 
our heads together and come up with a final version.
Please ignore my previous e-mail which included the wrong attachment.
Ted, please see if they will agree to Texas law (see last paragraph).  If 
not, let me know.
Otherwise, this looks fine.

Subject: Gallop

we hear anything more we'll keep you all informed.   Have a happy new year.  
MK
Transwestern has drafted the attached rebuttal testimony in response to 
testimony filed by Kern River and the Post-Interim Settlement parties.  
Please let me know if you have comments.
I have been working with Ramona and Lorraine to make system adjustments to 
TW's LFT arising from conclusions made at a Northern LFT meeting a few weeks 
ago.  One change that has been called for is that if a Limited Day is called 
(for now let's say a total Limited Day, without notifying shippers of any 
percentages), no LFT can flow at any time during that day but the LFT shipper 
would have the option to flow IT to the extent space is available.  If a 
Limited Day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage 
would flow, LFT shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest 
could be scheduled IT.  

Drew latched onto this when I mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this 
change with me.  As currently configured, TW's system would allow LFT 
shippers to put in nominations on a Limited Day, and if any LFT capacity were 
in fact available that LFT would be scheduled.  Similarly, if TW were to 
notify shippers of a partial Limited Day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity 
in fact became available, TW's system (today) would allow LFT shippers to put 
their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.   TW's tariff 
language appears suitably vague to allow this --  a Limited Day is defined as 
a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and 
the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of 
gas is transported.  

Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the 
first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on 
the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).  If 
so, is the change necessary for some other reason?   Please let me know what 
you think.

Ashley -- here is a lease renewal letter.  Pumpkin is welcome to stay over at 
your place.  In fact, if you or Deron need me to check in on her at any time, 
walk her, etc., you really should not hesitate to call me (713-864-4960)!  I 
love dogs and wish I could justify having one!
Hi Mum!  I had a fun time this weekend.  It was good to have everyone 
together.  Glad K&J are relaxing about Mema and the baby.  She gets such a 
kick out of seeing her.  Thanks for the new clothes; I still can't believe we 
let you shop for us on Mother's Day weekend!  

Got a message that Lois came by and got the dishes.  Earlier when I was in a 
meeting she left a voice mail saying she wasn't sure what exit to use off of 
610.  Wish they lived closer and I could have just stopped by.

Had another sleepless night Sun. and finally took some Unisom and had a good 
night's sleep last night.  What a relief.  I have really never had this 
problem before.  It's good to have a lot of energy, but you have to shut down 
sometime.

Am sending you my travel schedule for next week.  The following week (May 29 
- June 2) I'm planning to be in SF also, but I'm not sure I'll actually have 
to be there that long.

Have a good afternoon!

Hi, Sooz!  Hope you had a good trip back home yesterday.  I really do wish
Houston were at least an hour closer.

Thank you for the beautiful pjs and robe and for the Sunday brunch.  I wish
Karin had been more help to you, but then, she never has been.  I really
appreciate all your work.

Good cartoon on the editorial page this a.m.:  Putin, the new Russian
president, was seated at his desk when an aide comes in and says, " George W.
Bush wants to know if you're related to Ras Putin."

Darrell and I went on an early morning walk and neither of us felt very well
and doubled back before reaching the bridge.  I think I was all tuckered out
from our Sun. walk.

The 3 of us were trying to get together for Darrell's birthday lunch, so I'm
going to make lunch here on Sat.  Cathy is coming into town for a haircut and
K&J&G will be here since Karin has an appt. as well.  We usually go out to
lunch, but I don't want to miss any baby time!

I'm cleaning up the house from the weekend today.  Hope you have a good week.
 love, mum

In case you do not have my draft of the filing, here it is.

Subject: Fuel Monetization Meeting

Please join me tomorrow, Wednesday May 17th, at 3:00 p.m. in room 4194 to 
discuss some of the details of implementing Transwestern's potential fuel 
monetization service.  Thanks!
Edd, looks like the gas industry restructuring thing is going to bring me to 
SF next Tues. thru Thurs., then May 29 thru June 2.  I had thought about 
going for the whole Memorial Day weekend, but Bill's going to be in Boston 
the following weekend, so I now think that June 3 - 4 would be the better 
weekend for me to hang out in Cali.  It's all sort of loosey-goosey anyway 
because the judge has not announced the order in which witnesses will be 
presented.  I think she forgets some of us are from out of town!  Makes it 
really hard to plan.  I'll know for sure by the 25th.  Thank goodness for 
refundable airline tickets.  Anyway, are going to be around that 1st weekend 
of June?  And -- might you be available for dinner next Tuesday or 
Wednesday?  These guys like to talk business well into the evening hours, but 
my interest starts to wane near suppertime and I could probably make excuses 
and leave.

Bill and I took a whirlwind trip to Arizona a couple of weekends ago.  He was 
in Bullhead City, of all places, where his uncle has a vacation home.  I 
joined him a few days later in Vegas.  Luckily he had been to Laughlin 2 
nights in a row and had gotten blackjack out of his system.  We set out for 
Sedona but first had to stop at Hoover Dam, then a diner in Kingman (on Route 
66 of course).  Stayed a couple of nights in Sedona, where we climbed lots of 
rocks (which we later found out were protected nature preserve areas -- oops) 
and got real dusty and sunburned.  Then we drove up to the Grand Canyon and 
hung out at the South Rim.  Actually, we climbed down Bright Angel Trail & 
back up, then drove straight to the Las Vegas airport, from which we took the 
redeye so Bill could make it to his trial the next day.    I would really 
love to spend more time in the Grand Canyon -- maybe not this fall, but the 
next.  

Ciao fo' now, and lots of soul

S.Lynn -- FYI, here is my draft of the fuel filing for TW.  This is very much a 
work in progress and we're having a meeting tomorrow to discuss logistics.  
We've invited Darrell and Richard to the meeting; if there is anyone else you 
think we should include just let me know.
On Friday the Commission issued an order suspending (until October 15, 2000) 
TW's tariff sheets for acquiring PNM capacity, and calling for a technical 
conference.  The Commission stated that while TW's proposal may be in the 
public interest, further investigation of the issues, including those raised 
by Dynegy in its protest, is necessary prior to authorization.  The order 
does not make clear what issues are to be investigated, but they seem to 
include:  whether TW will, in effect, become a marketer for PNM's services, 
whether the rates are just and reasonable and whether there is any expansion 
of monopoly power.  Additionally, the Commission noted that while PNM has 
certificate (i.e., public convenience & necessity) authority to transport gas 
in interstate commerce, PNM will "have to either explain how it has 
appropriate rate authority for transportation of natural gas in interstate 
commerce, or seek appropriate rate authority from the Commission."   Lorraine 
has forwarded a copy of the order to PNM so that they can begin taking the 
appropriate steps.

I will talk with regulatory about technical conference dates and will tell 
you when I have further information.  If you would like a copy of the order, 
let me know.Elizabeth -- As we discussed, billing will need to take place pursuant to 
Section 30.8(e) (i.e., refund or credit to the releasing shipper).

Here is the language you requested for our posting:

In accordance with Section 30.9(f) of the General Terms and Conditions of 
Transwestern's Tariff, Releasing Shipper shall remain liable to Transwestern 
for payment of reservation charges and any applicable surcharges.

If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call.Please see the attached in connection with sales of capacity options on TW.
Wow, you struck a nerve with this one!  My grandmother (Mema) is an absolute 
nightmare when around family, but really sweet to everyone else!  Everyone 
tells me how wonderful and nice she is (she meets lots of people I know on 
her commute to her office downtown), and I just have to keep my mouth shut 
because no one would believe some of the things she says & does.  Example:  
over Christmas she kept trying to tell my 8-months pregnant sister all kinds 
of delivery-room horror stories!  I finally had to yell at her to get her to 
shut up.  Maybe you remember Mema; she calls every so often and bullies 
receptionists and secretaries into tracking me down instead of just leaving a 
message.  Of course, everyone but me thinks it is really cute.

Hope your holiday was really great!

I agree with Glen's comments,  anything greater than the allowed MDQ can flow 
or be scheduled, but it would be at the IT rate.  Based on the contract, the 
overrun rate is usually the same as the firm rate so I don't believe there is 
a revenue issue.  Keep in mind, when a day is limited the mdq is "reduced" 
systemiatically  to that level so anything greater is overrun.  MK

Although I would like to collect the LFT revenue in the second example on 
60%, isn't the extra unanticipated  10% TI? The tariff is vague in regard to 
partial days.  It appears we could call a partial limited day  based on a 
percentage of the MDQ or a specific volume level however once we have 
announced the firm level haven't we made a commitment only to that level of 
MDQ on a firm basis and any other volumes that might flow would be regarded 
as overrun?

their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%.   TW's tariff 
language appears suitably vague to allow this --  a Limited Day is defined as 
a day on which TW may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and 
the billing section has a provision for Limited Days on which any quantity of 
gas is transported.  

Our question was whether, by changing TW's LFT system as described in the 
first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on 
the table (because the IT rate is generally lower than our firm rate).  If 
so, is the change necessary for some other reason?   Please let me know what 
you think.

Tony & Frazier -- several comments from TW Commercial.

Page 1:  Streamlined Credit -- what does "interested parties" mean? parties 
interested in bidding, or parties interested in us having a look at their 
credit ?  Probably need to make this clear; on first reading, looks like 
obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional.  (Don't we want everyone 
to get approval ahead of bidding?).

Page 2:  you state that "individual bid transactions are kept confidential."  
What is confidential:  the identity of the shipper?  the bid itself?  In TW's 
IOS, we post the individual bids as they come in, but do not post the name of 
the shipper.  We feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get 
a higher rate as shippers bid against each other, and likewise recommend 
online bids be posted in real time.  I notice you call them "sealed bids" on 
page 4 -- not true if we're going to show them.

Page 3:  why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish 
creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding?  Especially 
since we plan to attract brand-new shippers by offering this service.  Our 
credit dept. folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between 
2 and 4 on bid day.

If we're asking that shippers submit bids to 3 decimal places, our example 
should be to 3 decimal places (e.g., $0.351).

Page 7:  "an" Capacity Trading Agreement should be "a" Capacity Trading 
Agreement.

Page 8:  So we don't appear low-tech, let's go ahead and tell shippers we 
plan to have the Request for Service and the service agreement available for 
online submittal at some point in the near future.

Also, we've never asked shippers to submit a Request for Service with each 
bid.  A shipper may bid and re-bid several times over the bidding process.  
They really only need to submit the Request for Service at the time of, or 
prior to, the first bid.  I recommend stating "You must submit a Request for 
Service prior to making your initial bid" so they don't think they have to 
submit a new one every time they revise their bid.

Page 9:  Under "When TW will Respond":  need to specify how notification will 
be sent.  

Page 14:  Column that says "Price" should say "Rate" (for a second there we 
thought you were talking about gas prices).  Also, please use example rates 
that are more realistic for TW (in the $0.240 to $0.299 would be great...)

Thanks for all your hard work on this.  I'll be here if you have any 
questions.

Subject: TW Webtext on EOL

Attached is a revised draft of the webtext. You will note that we have added 
the transportation service request form in the text. The bidder will have to 
print the form, fill it out and fax it to us because it is our understanding 
that we can't work it into the website for completion and execution online in 
the time frame for July 1 service. 

Also, please note that (1) we have changed the some of the information in the 
Account Manager grid and (2) the attached draft assumes that the Bid List, 
from the original text, is the same document as the Account Manager page .  

We are assuming that we would not be able to get the Transportation Service 
Agreement available for online execution by clicking for July 1. Thus, we 
will handle the service agreement manually. However, for subsequent months we 
contemplate establishing contracting procedures so that the service agreement 
can be executed online by a click. 


Frazier and Tony


 When the Commission granted Texas Eastern authority to hold capacity on 
another pipeline in Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, 74 FERC P 61,074 
(1996), it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream 
pipeline, the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas 
transported on the upstream pipeline.  The Commission recognized this as one 
of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule.  Specifically, 
the Commission stated:  

The downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has 
acquired on an upstream 
pipeline. Rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the 
gas on the upstream 
pipeline. We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will 
not, however, allow the pipeline 
to hold title to the gas being shipped.  Thus, the downstream pipeline will 
be the shipper on the upstream 
pipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped. This results 
in a limited exception to the rule 
that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped. 

I believe that if we can address the Commission's other concerns about this 
filing, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction.  You can feel 
free to pass this along to your contact at PNM.Dear Judge Biren:

Attached is the Prepared Rebuttal Testimony of Jeffery C. Fawcett on Behalf

I forgot to tell you to check your FBCat e-mail for a birthday surprise!
If it did not arrive, let me know.  Hope y'all had a good weekend.

In response to your inquiries about whether TW's tariff allows the format 
posting, bidding and awarding of capacity in our EnronOnline proposal, here 
is my 2 cents' worth.

The criteria for awarding capacity is found in the Right of First Refusal 
section of TW's tariff (for some reason that's never been clear to me). See 
Section 13.A. (Sheet No. 18):  "All available capacity shall be allocated 
under these procedures, and Transporter will not maintain a firm 
transportation queue."  The ROFR section does specify the posting and bidding 
procedures (including a minimum one month period between posting and the bid 
deadline -- See Section 13.D.) but arguably these timelines only apply to the 
ROFR bidding process, not to an open season for other capacity.  Even if the 
one-month minimum bid period did apply outside the ROFR process, the 
EnronOnline proposal complies by giving shippers at least a month to submit 
bids (Tony -- am I right about this?).

The only other relevant part of our tariff is the EBB/Internet section of the 
General Terms and Conditions (beginning on Sheet No. 72).   TW will continue 
to comply with all provisions in this section.  The section even specifically 
provides that shippers may request service and contract electronically.

I've found nothing in else in TW's tariff that would appear to address an 
online open season one way or the other.  I believe our tariff gives us the 
flexibility to sell capacity online as we've proposed to do.

Hope this helps.  If you want to discuss this I'll be here most of the day, 
and I will be reachable by e-mail while I'm in San Francisco next week.  My 
hearing does not start 'til noon Houston time on Tuesday, so if we need to 
talk Tuesday morning you can reach me at my hotel (415.398.1234).


Since the 311 belt/suspenders approach didn't quite fit, I've had to try to 
convince Mr. Hertzberg that he ought to rely on the NGA Sec. 1 exemption for 
gatherers (Frank Kelly and Frazier concur with us on this, by the way).  He 
is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his 
proposition that being a shipper on TW would subject a gathering company to 
FERC jurisdiction.  I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an 
extensive gathering system that interconnects with TW's system, has for many 
years been a shipper on TW.  Also, Lindy has found that Red Cedar already has 
a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, 
Transcolorado, so if Hertzberg's theory is right they are going to jail 
anyway!

Red Cedar also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have 
title to the gas they ship.  At this point Lorraine and I believe they might 
just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.  If anything 
interesting happens I'll let you know.Here is a kitty for your office.

I really miss mine now that they are in Kitty Jail!
Tried to print a blank form without success.  Is there any other way I can 
get one, so I can do some rough drafts of my reviews on my business trip next 
week.  Please advise.

Hi Susan,

Attached below is the draft discount letter to Lorraine's 10 year SWG deal.  
Please review and provide any revisions if necessary.  FYI,  the base FTS-1 
agreement will show that SWG will only have capacity November-March of each 
year.  Therefore do you agree that  my discount language does not need to 
incorporate the Nov-March term designation since the discount rate paragraph 
3 states that the rate shall be multiplied by the total contract quantity (0 
MMcf/d) contract quantity April-Oct)?

Thanks for your expedited review.

Since the market affiliate rule looks at business units rather than the 
function within the business unit (or any firewalls that are set up), since 
he works for ECT I have to say I would be uncomfortable putting him on the

him access to our work product is probably a violation of the rule.

Thanks, Debbie









Since the contract quantity goes to zero in Nov.-Mar., they pay no 
reservation charge in those months, so effectively the rate is zero for those 
months.  I suppose we could draft it either way and logistically it would 
work.  We used a similar structure in a deal we did earlier this year, if I 
recall correctly.

Also --  I agree that we would need to file this as a material deviation if 
SWG agrees to include the capacity release provision.  In case FERC does not 
like the provision for some reason, do we want to provide that disapproval by 
FERC will invalidate the whole contract (see language in the recent USGT 
contract), or do we want it to invalidate just that provision and let the 
rest of the deal stand?  It would depend on how much value the parties are 
attaching to that provision and whether we would want a chance to 
renegotiate...and I am assuming we would.  Christine, let me know which is 
preferable and I'll send you some language in the a.m.

Subject: RE: Exhibit


At the ALJ's direction, this subject was discussed among the parties who
were present in the hearing room yesterday at the lunch break and again
after the conclusion of hearings for the day.  The parties present reached
agreement on a process for this exhibit.

I had to leave for home immediately after the discussions in the hearing
room at the end of yesterday due to a family emergency.

I am informed the results of these discussions were put on the record today.
I understand that SoCalGas will provide to all parties by June 16 a draft of
the exhibit.  Parties can then comment to SoCalGas and we will attempt to
get a consensus by June 21.  SoCalGas will file by June 21 either a version
that has concensus, or failing concensus, its own version of what it thinks
the exhibit should show.  Parties who do not agree with what SoCalGas files
on June 21 can file on June 23 either their own version or comments on
SoCalGas' version.

I cannot absolutely guarantee the accuracy of the above details since I was
not present today and there is no transcript yet for today.

If this arrangement is not acceptable to Transwestern, you should object to
the ALJ immediately.  Hearings are scheduled to conclude after the lunch
break today.

Also, I am informed that SCGC has distributed in the hearing room and will
attempt to introduce today a written exhibit that includes an extensive
discussion of its views on the subject of "mismatches" of delivery and
take-away capacity at the California border.

Subject: Exhibit


Glen, at page 1020 of the transcript of yesterday's proceedings, the judge
asked you and Norm Pedersen to work with various other parties to develop
an exhibit reflecting capacity at the California border.  The judge
mentioned she wanted to discuss the exhibit this morning, so I am surprised
that you did not attempt to contact me to get Transwestern's input or at
least to let us review the exhibit.  I would like to review the exhibit as
soon as possible.  I am out of town but you can either e-mail it to me or
fax it to 941-466-2198 (before 3 pm PDT).  Also, I should be reachable on
my mobile phone (713-494-5002) or by voice mail at my office
(713-853-0596).



Luckily, we will have input re. the exhibit, and if SoCal does not cooperate 
to make it accurate, we will be able to file our own with an explanation.  
Lad is such a weasel.  Why don't we try to talk sometime this a.m.

Subject: Socal Receipt Point Exhibit


Well unfortunately, Ladd managed to confuse the judge as to the Upstream
capacity into the Socal system. In doing so he has potentially opened up a
"real" danger for TW at Hector Rd. and again completely left out of his
testimony S.Needles aka Topock capacity of 200 mmcfd. Now Socal will try to
poll the parties so as to prepare a consensus Exhibit that will put "fact"
to the upstream capacities into the Socal system. Well, I fear that the
other pipeline lines will shape the facts to their agendas and we will have
a distorted landscape into the Socal system. The downside I perceive is that
the judge will 1) want to Let the Market decide via increasing the maximum
receipt point capacity allowed  or 2) want further comments on the entire
Socal receipt point capacity structure. These two onerous outcomes can be
avoided if the judge receives a consensus Exhibit(at least from the
Settlement parties) that is explained in a consistent manner  and with
common terms. For example, if we look at just FERC capacities in lieu of
perfect design capacities we might calm down these issues.

We will likely lead this process for the CSA parties, Lets discuss Monday
morning. Hope everything went well in Florida, especially you Jeff . I hope
you just banged up your pride and not your body to badly.

Mark, IGS


Anyway, Ann isn't coming on Friday because she can't stand it that everyone 
is a couple, so she is going instead with her ex boyfriend  to a dinner party 
given by some people she doesn't even know.  Although I am trying very hard 
to be understanding, I'm not doing a very good job.  When I was in her 
situation, I seem to remember enjoying my best friends' company whether I had 
a date or not!  But that's just me.  

Hope you are still having tanning weather in Austin.  We certainly are here.  
If you feel you are not getting enough color for your trip to Cabo, I'll come 
before you leave and help you with the Clinique Tan-In-A-Tube!  (You will 
still have to wear sunscreen).  What are your trip dates again?

Have a good day!

Love, 
SoozTony, I thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate 
pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it 
must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some 
other basis.  It seems a simple enough extension of the principle that 
capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.  However, I did not 
find any case that stands for that exact proposition.  As you may be aware, 
the Commission made Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) come up 
with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory 
basis...because NGPL was found to have been giving preferential treatment to 
its shippers.  NGPL's solution was to come up with an auction process, and 
there is a whole line of cases if you're interested.  The underlying 
presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is 
awarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be acting 
discriminatorily.  But of course the Commission never comes out and says this 
even though it should be obvious.

Probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the NGA 
(doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim. 
basis?).  Also, in your memo I'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippers 
of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award the 
capacity to Sempra (assuming Sempra requested capacity after the posting), we 
will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to 
participate in the auction process.  

Maybe in future postings on Enrononline we should include a statement to the 
effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the 
Enrononline process.

Now for some trivia.  Remember we were discussing with Shelley whether we 
could post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) for 
determining best bid?  In my Westlaw search I ran across the relevant case.  
In Northwest Pipeline, 85 FERC P 61,335, the Commission stated:  "The 
Commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season 
provisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid 
evaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing 
different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different 
transactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology 
before the bidding process begins."  The only problem is I am not sure we 
have that "flexibility" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post 
a different method.  Maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some 
language allowing us to do so.

I have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what 
you write I'd be happy to.
If I remember correctly, we'll need to paper the additional Sempra capacity, 
either with an amendment or a separate agreement.  I'll be in the office by 
about 9:30 and we can talk about it then. Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably 
(i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would 
amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can 
acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent TW from 
becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never 
been our intention).  Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether 
this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same 
concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our 
proposal too.  Comments?  let me know.  I know that you've already indicated that you will circulate a draft of the 
late-filed exhibit by Friday, but if you have a draft we could look at 
sooner, that would be great...TW's business people who need to look at it 
will be out at the beginning of next week.  Thanks.Something's up with our e-mail, but I did receive it finally.  Thanks.

Brian,
Transwestern has reviewed your draft exhibit responsive to Judge Biren's 
inquiry on June 7.  We appreciate your work on it and generally agree with 
the exhibit and the approach taken by SoCalGas.  However, we think it 
appropriate to balance simplicity with the need to be responsive to Judge 
Biren's questions.  

See the attached marked-up version of the exhibit.  We've attempted to 
streamline the data provided for "non-Wheeler" points, and to clarify the 
footnotes regarding Wheeler Ridge.  Also, we've modified the numbers 
regarding the TW Topock lateral to accurately reflect the lateral's 400 
MMcf/d physical capability.  We've also made some minor formatting changes.

Let us know what you think.

Jeff Fawcett

Tony, I'd love to see our posting on EnronOnline -- do you know if there's an 
easy way for us "insiders" to access it?You got mail from Norm!

     Do Transwestern shippers to Transwestern's North Needles delivery
point have 1090 MMcfd of primary rights into ScCalGas, 750 of primary
rights. or some other number?

In response to your inquiry, Transwestern would first like to clear up the 
terminology being used here.  As you know, currently SoCalGas doesn't assign 
"primary rights" to deliveries off of any interconnecting pipeline.  The 
establishment of tradeable rights for intrastate capacity is among the issues 
currently under consideration in the GIR proceeding.   However, if what you 
are asking about is what has been the historical or otherwise available 
receipt capacity for Transwestern deliveries at North Needles, then let me 
offer the following. 

Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could 
physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt 
point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its 
interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed 
the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d.

I'm attaching an article that I just received about the CPUC's and Indicated 
Shippers' protests of the recent ENA deal on El Paso.   I have a call in to 
Drew Fossum to talk about formulating a formal response, and I will keep you 
in that loop in case you get any inquiries.  (My initial, unofficial reaction 
is that with the marketing affiliate rules and other safeguards in place, the 
fact that ENA and Transwestern have the same parent company should make no 
difference to the FERC.)  Until further notice, I would avoid any 
communication with ENA on these issues.  If you have any questions, please 
e-mail or call me (x30596).

Subject: The El Paso Controversy Continues

Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA

     Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's 
regulators and Indicated
     Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three 
transportation agreements by
     which Enron North America Corp. has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of 
unsubscribed firm
     capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. 

     Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of 
Transwestern Pipeline
     and Enron North America, control over all the available transportation 
capacity to the
     southern California border, warned Harvey Morris, principal attorney for 
the California
     Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which plans to submit its protest 
today. Between
     the two pipelines, he estimated Enron will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm 
capacity from the
     San Juan and Permian basins to California. 

     For Morris, Enron North America's contracting of the El Paso capacity 
represents a
     worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Dynegy Marketing and 
Trade, who has
     held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. 
"At least then
     there was some Transwestern competition to the Dynegy situation. Now 
it's Enron, the
     owner of Transwestern, who's stepping into Dynegy's shoes." 

     But "what's even worse," he told NGI, is the revenue-sharing provision 
in the contracts. It
     stipulates that "after Enron makes $35 million off of these contracts, 
it has to share the
     proceeds with El Paso for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So 
effectively, Enron and
     El Paso have become partners in how high they can jack up the 
transportation rate
     differential between the California border and the Southwest producing 
basins." 

     The two pipeline companies "that have for decades competed with each 
other in carrying
     Southwest supplies to California are now partners. We think that's 
anticompetitive, and
     there's no way FERC should approve it," Morris said. He recalled the 
basis differential
     between the San Juan Basin spot price and the California border shot up 
by 17% during
     1998, the first year during which Dynegy controlled the El Paso capacity 
into California.
     This situation could worsen under Enron, he believes. 

     "At first blush the El Paso-Enron contracts [do] not appear to contain 
the same
     anticompetitive features of the El Paso-Dynegy contracts," Indicated 
Shippers noted, but
     a "closer review and analysis" reveals the anticompetitive effects of 
the revenue-sharing
     provision (RSP) in El Paso-Enron contracts "are not only similar" to 
those of the hotly
     contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the El Paso-Dynegy 
case, "but are
     increased......due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing 
affiliate of El Paso's
     primary interstate pipeline competitor," Transwestern. 

     Both the RRM and RSP "operate to provide a disincentive for El Paso and 
its competitors
     to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act 
to drive down the
     basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity," 
Indicated Shippers told
     FERC in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes 
producers
     Amoco Production, Burlington Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and 
Phillips
     Petroleum, and two marketers - Amoco Energy Trading and Phillips Gas 
Marketing. 

     FERC "should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred 
in allowing the
     El Paso-Dynegy contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after 
finding that the
     contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [D.C. Court 
of Appeals].
     That same error should not be repeated here," the producers and 
marketers said. 

     The CPUC's attempt to block the Enron-El Paso contracts at the outset is 
a little bit
     unusual for the agency, Morris said, but it learned its lesson following 
Dynegy. "When the
     Dynegy situation first hit, we asked for FERC to investigate the matter. 
We thought
     FERC did a very inadequate job then.....This time around we're asking 
for FERC to
     summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a 
strong stand right at
     the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering 
under the Dynegy
     situation. And this is even worse." 

     In the event the Commission should reject California's request, the CPUC 
has asked that
     an "anti-hoarding condition" be included in the contracts, which would 
require Enron to
     release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher 
than what it's paying
     El Paso for the capacity. "They must make a little profit," Morris 
noted. "We're confident
     Enron can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity.....so there's going to 
be unused
     capacity." 

     The agency also wants FERC to clarify that the primary delivery point 
for the Block II
     portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is PG&E-Topock in keeping with the 
terms of the
     1996 settlement between El Paso and its customers. Morris said he agreed 
fully with
     Amoco, Burlington Resources and Southern California Gas (SoCalGas), 
which accused
     El Paso of violating the 1996 agreement by allowing Dynegy to use 
SoCalGas-Topock as
     a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They 
contend the alleged
     violation is included in the Enron contracts. 

     He also noted the CPUC will challenge the ability of Enron to call back 
Block II capacity
     after it already had been recalled by El Paso shippers to serve Pacific 
Gas and Electric
     (PG&E) customers in northern California. Last July, FERC granted Dynegy 
the right to
     do this under its contracts with El Paso. But Morris contends the 
decision violates the
     1996 settlement under which PG&E paid $54 million to preserve the right 
of the pipeline's
     shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its 
service territory. 

     The CPUC also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would 
enable Enron
     to "just sit on the capacity," thereby withholding idle Block II 
capacity from the market.
     Indicated Shippers also contend the Enron contracts violate the Block II 
capacity
     provisions of the 1996 rate case, as well as "exacerbate" the primary 
firm delivery point
     capacity-allocation issues that are pending before FERC now. 

     The CPUC accused El Paso of "deliberately" filing the Enron contracts at 
FERC just
     before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline "is trying to 
sneak one of the most
     controversial things ever past FERC right before Christmas so that 
protests would be
     minimized," said Morris. "They did this with the Dynegy contracts two 
years ago. They
     have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for 
people to protest and
     harder for FERC to stop it from going into effect."

Mike -- Thanks for the input...we stewed over this for a while but decided to 
respond (as briefly as possible) rather than give Norm a chance to whine to 
the judge that we were being uncooperative in this somewhat unusual exhibit 
drafting process.  Jeff's answer is consistent with what will appear in the 
exhibit (and from what one can find out about TW in numerous of our FERC 
filings, for that matter).  If Norm tries somehow to make Jeff's response 
part of the record you can bet I will object...if it's not on the record 
already, or on the face of this one late-filed exhibit, it should not be 
allowed into the record.  
Apparently Norm has also called Rich Hall with annoying questions.
I don't plan to respond if he contacts us with any follow-up, but will let 
you know if he does.

Susan:

 Good response.  Be advised that Norm is a little out of order asking
discovery questions like this after the record is closed.  You are not
obligated to respond to him under these circumstances.  He is still trying
to buttress his apparent belief that the EPNG and TW capacity to the
California border is completely fungible and can be delivered to either
SoCal or PG&E without any limitations.  Please let me know if he tries this
again.  Thanks, Mike

Subject: Late-Filed Exhibit



In response to your inquiry, Transwestern would first like to clear up the
terminology being used here.  As you know, currently SoCalGas doesn't
assign "primary rights" to deliveries off of any interconnecting pipeline.
The establishment of tradeable rights for intrastate capacity is among the
issues currently under consideration in the GIR proceeding.   However, if
what you are asking about is what has been the historical or otherwise
available receipt capacity for Transwestern deliveries at North Needles,
then let me offer the following.

Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could
physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles
receipt point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to
its interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to
exceed the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09
Bcf/d.

     Do Transwestern shippers to Transwestern's North Needles delivery
point have 1090 MMcfd of primary rights into ScCalGas, 750 of primary
rights. or some other number?

     Your proposed draft exhibit goes substantially beyond the ALJ's order.
ALJ Biren specifically stated that the the late-filed exhibit "should be
narrowly focused on the mismatch of capacity." Tr. 1021.Thus, you need to
eliminate the column entitled "Total Take-away Capacity."  Furthermore, the
column is both suspect (e.g., the representation that EOR is 770 MMcfd) and
misleading (e.g., the inclusion of SWG or PG&E in "S. Calif Take-away
Capacity").  Also, you need to eliminate the "Avg. Daily Market" box.  The
following is what should be submitted to ALJ Biren:
(See attached file: #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (EX. TO
I.99-07-003).doc)
 - #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (EX. TO I.99-07-003).doc
Mike, obviously this is unacceptable.  Norm's exhibit contains factual 
inaccuracies we cannot live with.  I'm assuming the rest of the group will 
react similarly and Norm will be stuck filing his own exhibit.  Your thoughts?

     Your proposed draft exhibit goes substantially beyond the ALJ's order.
ALJ Biren specifically stated that the the late-filed exhibit "should be
narrowly focused on the mismatch of capacity." Tr. 1021.Thus, you need to
eliminate the column entitled "Total Take-away Capacity."  Furthermore, the
column is both suspect (e.g., the representation that EOR is 770 MMcfd) and
misleading (e.g., the inclusion of SWG or PG&E in "S. Calif Take-away
Capacity").  Also, you need to eliminate the "Avg. Daily Market" box.  The
following is what should be submitted to ALJ Biren:
(See attached file: #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (EX. TO
I.99-07-003).doc)
 - #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (EX. TO I.99-07-003).doc


Brian -- TW does not agree with the changes proposed by El Paso.  If we need 
to discuss this further please e-mail or call.
Thanks.

Subject: I.99-07-003 - EPNG Revisions To SoCalGas Draft Exh 28 re Pipeline 
Capacity


Attached is an e-mail containing revisions and additions El Paso recommends be
made to SoCalGas' draft Exhibit 28 which was distributed for further comment 
to
parties on June 16, 2000.  This e-mail has two attachments.  The first 
attachment
is a revised copy of SoCalGas' table titled "Firm Pipeline Capacity into 
Southern
California" with changes to:  (a) correct the amount of firm interstate 
capacity on
El Paso at Topock, shown in the col. "Incoming Interstate Capacity," by 
replacing
the incorrect figure, 2230 MMcfd (which includes capacity for delivery to SW 
Gas
which is not available to California on a firm basis) with the correct 
figure,  2080
MMcfd; (b) delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from 
the
col. "Total Take-away Capacity" since this capacity is not firm capacity 
available
to California; (c) adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols. affected by 
these
changes; (d) add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El 
Paso
have existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to 
SoCalGas
totaling 1466 MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas' take-away capacity at Topock
and clearly creates a "mismatch"; and (c) add reference in footnote (2) to the
physical capacity of Kern/Mojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas at
Wheeler Ridge South, which is in excess of 680 MMcfd even though the metering
is currently set to 500 MMcfd.   The second attachment contains two schematics
intended to supplement SoCalGas' draft map of receipt points and
interconnections.  These schematics more accurately reflect the actual 
physical
interconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurate
impression that the interconnect with  El Paso at Topock consists of several
separate pipelines with no cross over, and that inaccurate impression that 
several
interconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road .   El Paso
understands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses to
Administrative Law Judge Biren's request for a late filed exhibit concerning
"mismatches" and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGas
receipt points.  In the spirit of compromise, El Paso  will not oppose 
SoCalGas
filing an exhibit as proposed 6/16/00 provided it is revised to reflect the 
changes
and additions El Paso has proposed in this e-mail.   Very truly yours, Edward

Glen,

Please see Kevin's note below.  I agree that we should keep separate 
distribution lists for Transwestern.  I have had other requests like 
Kevin's.  As a temporary and imperfect solution, I have marked the labels 
either All Holders or Filings.   Dennis Lee is currently working to put 
Northern and Transwestern mailing lists on the PLE system.  He indicated that 
the process should be ready by the middle of July.  Perhaps we need to 
consider separating the Transwestern list at that time as we do  Northern's.

Subject: Transwestern FERC tariff pages

Hi Naomi, 
my name is Kevin Hyatt.  I am the marketing director in Houston for 
Transwestern Pipeline.  I have a favor to ask of you: could you possibly send 
me only those tariff page copies slated for "insertion" into our tariff books 
and not the pages that are "submitted for filing"?  

My reason is this: by the time the "submitted for filing" pages get to me, 
it's too late for me to make any changes to them (not that I would anyway) 
and they just get tossed out when the final pages are approved and printed.

If keeping up with a separate distribution list is not feasible I 
understand.  However, I wonder how many other folks feel the same way as I 
do?  If the number of people is significant, then there is the potential to 
save a lot of time, effort, and money by reducing the copying, printing, and 
distribution costs.

Let me know what you think.
thanks

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.

With regard to capacity release I think we will have to give the replacement 
shipper the cash-for-fuel option, because what if we have sold capacity that 
was created by the releasing shipper's buying fuel from us?  If the 
replacement shipper suddenly starts shipping fuel, that capacity goes away.  
(It's sort of like the EFBH/resulting forward haul problem).  Probably we 
should require that the cash for fuel election automatically transfer to the 
replacement shipper.  This would probably have to go into our tariff 
someplace when we make our FERC filing; otherwise it might run contrary to 
our current tariff provisions and practice.  Another solution might be to 
just sell resulting capacity as LFT, daily FTS-1 or even FTS-3 capacity (with 
some modifications to the FTS-3 Rate Schedule, of course), which would allow 
us the flexibility not to schedule on certain days.  For longer-term deals 
this might not be practicable, though.  

Further questions...let me know.

Subject: TW Cash for Fuel Issues

Christine,

After our meeting last week, John, Elizabeth, Gerry, Richard, Dave & I 
discussed various options related to this cash for fuel process. We had 
several open issues that came up in our discussions and they are as follows:

Regulatory/Legal issue: Can we have contract specific language on our firm 
contracts that would prevent the firm shipper from releasing this fuel 
discount  cash option to an acquiring shipper?     If we must offer this 
special cash option to the acquiring shipper we will need to build a process 
to track this fuel option from the firm shipper to the releasing shipper. 
This will require more system modifications that we have not accounted for at 
this time.

Shipper nomination issue: How will we handle shipper nomination line items 
that are nominated as overrun paths on their firm contracts?  Could we 
default these "02" overrun transactions to calculate the fuel in kind using 
our existing tariff fuel %?  This would  make the process of trying to 
reconcile the contracted MDQ fuel volumes easier when we verify that the 
volumes the shipper elected to pay in cash tie back to the total volumes 
scheduled & paid for in cash..

Tariff Sheet issue:  When you state in the tariff provision that "The shipper 
may use the cash for fuel option only if the posted point of sale is a 
receipt point on shipper's service agreement" Does this only apply to the 
shipper's primary receipt points?

I would appreciate it if you could respond to these issues. If you feel like 
we should meet to discuss, I will be glad to set up another meeting. Please 
let me know.

Thanks Ramona

Ramona, "total cost commitment" in TW's tariff generally means total revenue 
to be received from a transaction, taking 
into account reservation rate, the term of the commitment, and the commodity 
revenues associated with any minimum 
throughput commitment the shipper may make.  Obviously some of these items 
aren't applicable in the PNR context; the 
language must have just been lifted from another part of the tariff.  For PNR 
we would just multiply rate times number 
of days the service will be used.  Practically speaking, I'm not sure how 
this is done if you have an interruptible service with 
no throughput commitment, but I think you should just be able to use the 
number of days in the contract term.  

If there's a tie (i.e. more than one shipper willing to pay at or above max 
rate), we just allocate the capacity pro-rata.  We 
do not have to offer a right to match.

Subject: TW Tariff

Susan,

I am working with TK on automating TW's PNR allocation process & I was 
reviewing the tariff rules for TW PNR allocation of service on sheet 37e. 
Section 8.

Can you interpret the meaning of "total cost commitment"? We state that 
buyers willing to pay more than the maximum tariff rate will be considered to 
be paying the maximm rate and we will pro-rate amoung buyers willing to pay 
the same total cost commitment. Does this mean we must offer a right to 
match? What does the term "total cost commitment mean?

Thanks Ramona

Jeff,

From the pipeline group's perspective, this transaction is a commercial 
matter between El Paso and ENA.  Accordingly, the gas pipeline group does not 
believe that it is appropriate to participate in the development of ENA's 
response.  

I do understand that the referenced article and certain of the protests make 
factual allegations about Transwestern's available capacity to California.   
Susan Scott or I can certainly provide corrected information from 
Transwestern's available capacity postings.

Subject: Re: The El Paso Controversy Continues  

please read be story from trade press below.  i have not included et&s folks 
on this note because i'm uncertain regarding the rules with respect to 
communication among business units in these sorts of matters.  if it's 
acceptable to include tw in the notes and in conversations, that would be my 
preference.  rick, is it your view that tw can or cannot be included?

i believe i passed along word of the ena/el paso deal when it hit the press 
week before last.  the press reported both the amount of capacity and the 
price for which ena bought it from el paso.  to summarize:  ena purchased 
1.25 bcf per day for one year starting jan 1, 2000.  ena paid $38 million, 
which gives an average price of $.0831 per mmbtu.  (by contrast, williams 
bought about 0.1 bcf/day at an average rate of $.207.)   el paso released 
this information via a a press release without any prior approval from ena.  
julie, please don't hesitate to fill any holes or (unintended) innaccuracies.

the situation is complicated by the fact that california is currently in the 
midst of intense negotiations over restructuring the state's gas industry.  
the negotiations have been going on for about 8 months and have been very 
contentious.  socal has teamed with indicated producers, california 
manufacturers association, and muni generators from southern california to 
push a very "go slow" approach that is (surprise) quite friendly to larger 
users.  enron is teamed with western hub storage, wild goose storage, 
calpine, southern california edison, green mountain power, the city of 
vernon, and spurr/remac (provides services to california's k-12 school 
system) under an alliance called "california alliance for competition" 
(snappy, i know).  the cac proposal is pushing, among other things, a single, 
state-wide market for transport, storage and balancing, including tradeable 
rights in a secondary market.

indicated producers has been aggressive and hostile toward marketers--as has 
cma--throughout the negotiations.  ip's bile has not been reserved solely for 
enron, however.  one outcome of the negotiations has been the suit ip 
launched against el paso at ferc regarding el paso's nom process.  (i believe 
ena filed in support of the suit.)  el paso is losing that one and will 
likely change its nom process sooner rather than later.

i think it's important to have a quick call to develop a clear and consistent 
message on the ena deal and coordinate what we're saying about that deal with 
the other gas issues on the table.  i'm assuming that if there's anything we 
can do to keep harvey morris (and california) from mucking up the deal, the 
better.  i know harvey well.  i'm not sure, given his quotes, there's much 
"educating" to be done, but may make sense to meet with him, nonetheless.  
more important, indicated producers is the real--and biggest--problem.

let me know if you folks think there'd be value in briefly discussing the 
issue.

best,
jeff

Subject: The El Paso Controversy Continues

Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA

     Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's 
regulators and Indicated
     Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three 
transportation agreements by
     which Enron North America Corp. has contracted for 1.25 Bcf/d of 
unsubscribed firm
     capacity on El Paso Natural Gas. 

     Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of 
Transwestern Pipeline
     and Enron North America, control over all the available transportation 
capacity to the
     southern California border, warned Harvey Morris, principal attorney for 
the California
     Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), which plans to submit its protest 
today. Between
     the two pipelines, he estimated Enron will control 2.34 Bcf/d of firm 
capacity from the
     San Juan and Permian basins to California. 

     For Morris, Enron North America's contracting of the El Paso capacity 
represents a
     worse threat to the pipeline's other shippers than Dynegy Marketing and 
Trade, who has
     held the capacity for past two years and whose contract expires Dec. 31. 
"At least then
     there was some Transwestern competition to the Dynegy situation. Now 
it's Enron, the
     owner of Transwestern, who's stepping into Dynegy's shoes." 

     But "what's even worse," he told NGI, is the revenue-sharing provision 
in the contracts. It
     stipulates that "after Enron makes $35 million off of these contracts, 
it has to share the
     proceeds with El Paso for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So 
effectively, Enron and
     El Paso have become partners in how high they can jack up the 
transportation rate
     differential between the California border and the Southwest producing 
basins." 

     The two pipeline companies "that have for decades competed with each 
other in carrying
     Southwest supplies to California are now partners. We think that's 
anticompetitive, and
     there's no way FERC should approve it," Morris said. He recalled the 
basis differential
     between the San Juan Basin spot price and the California border shot up 
by 17% during
     1998, the first year during which Dynegy controlled the El Paso capacity 
into California.
     This situation could worsen under Enron, he believes. 

     "At first blush the El Paso-Enron contracts [do] not appear to contain 
the same
     anticompetitive features of the El Paso-Dynegy contracts," Indicated 
Shippers noted, but
     a "closer review and analysis" reveals the anticompetitive effects of 
the revenue-sharing
     provision (RSP) in El Paso-Enron contracts "are not only similar" to 
those of the hotly
     contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the El Paso-Dynegy 
case, "but are
     increased......due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing 
affiliate of El Paso's
     primary interstate pipeline competitor," Transwestern. 

     Both the RRM and RSP "operate to provide a disincentive for El Paso and 
its competitors
     to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act 
to drive down the
     basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity," 
Indicated Shippers told
     FERC in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes 
producers
     Amoco Production, Burlington Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and 
Phillips
     Petroleum, and two marketers - Amoco Energy Trading and Phillips Gas 
Marketing. 

     FERC "should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred 
in allowing the
     El Paso-Dynegy contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after 
finding that the
     contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [D.C. Court 
of Appeals].
     That same error should not be repeated here," the producers and 
marketers said. 

     The CPUC's attempt to block the Enron-El Paso contracts at the outset is 
a little bit
     unusual for the agency, Morris said, but it learned its lesson following 
Dynegy. "When the
     Dynegy situation first hit, we asked for FERC to investigate the matter. 
We thought
     FERC did a very inadequate job then.....This time around we're asking 
for FERC to
     summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a 
strong stand right at
     the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering 
under the Dynegy
     situation. And this is even worse." 

     In the event the Commission should reject California's request, the CPUC 
has asked that
     an "anti-hoarding condition" be included in the contracts, which would 
require Enron to
     release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher 
than what it's paying
     El Paso for the capacity. "They must make a little profit," Morris 
noted. "We're confident
     Enron can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity.....so there's going to 
be unused
     capacity." 

     The agency also wants FERC to clarify that the primary delivery point 
for the Block II
     portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is PG&E-Topock in keeping with the 
terms of the
     1996 settlement between El Paso and its customers. Morris said he agreed 
fully with
     Amoco, Burlington Resources and Southern California Gas (SoCalGas), 
which accused
     El Paso of violating the 1996 agreement by allowing Dynegy to use 
SoCalGas-Topock as
     a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They 
contend the alleged
     violation is included in the Enron contracts. 

     He also noted the CPUC will challenge the ability of Enron to call back 
Block II capacity
     after it already had been recalled by El Paso shippers to serve Pacific 
Gas and Electric
     (PG&E) customers in northern California. Last July, FERC granted Dynegy 
the right to
     do this under its contracts with El Paso. But Morris contends the 
decision violates the
     1996 settlement under which PG&E paid $54 million to preserve the right 
of the pipeline's
     shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its 
service territory. 

     The CPUC also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would 
enable Enron
     to "just sit on the capacity," thereby withholding idle Block II 
capacity from the market.
     Indicated Shippers also contend the Enron contracts violate the Block II 
capacity
     provisions of the 1996 rate case, as well as "exacerbate" the primary 
firm delivery point
     capacity-allocation issues that are pending before FERC now. 

     The CPUC accused El Paso of "deliberately" filing the Enron contracts at 
FERC just
     before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline "is trying to 
sneak one of the most
     controversial things ever past FERC right before Christmas so that 
protests would be
     minimized," said Morris. "They did this with the Dynegy contracts two 
years ago. They
     have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for 
people to protest and
     harder for FERC to stop it from going into effect."

Hi Mum!  If you want to come to Houston for the July 8 art crawl, that would 
be fun.  I plan to meet more of the gallery owners and talk to them about 
what they do.  Who knows, having my own gallery might actually become part of 
my long-range plan.  If not, I will have met some interesting people.

If you want to come to Houston sooner, I do not have much going on after my 
Sat. a.m. class at Rice, although I do have to catch a plane to D.C. on 
Monday morning.

The week is going OK.  All the tennis and swimming has left me with sore 
muscles so this is my night off.  Am planning to do some more house chores so 
I do not end up with another weekend like the last.

I'm still planning on coming to Austin next weekend, I'm just not sure when, 
but I'll let you know.

Call if you get lonely! 

Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz,

Got home about 1 p.m. today and can already feel my mood sinking--not ready
to get back into my solo mode.

Enjoyed being with the little bugaroo--even with the diarrhea, she was in a
good mood with the exception of an occasional sore bottom.  She smiles all
the time.  It does wear me out considerably when I have her all day long
though, and, especially this time, when I was tired from our trip and Eric's
visit.

I must think about a trip to Houston.  Are you aware of the big Houston art
day in the galleries on July 8th?  Just caught a glimpse of it when thumbing
through the new SW Art Mag.  I'll track it down and give you the particulars.
 (You'll have to review your travel schedule with me again.)

Hope you're having a good week.  love, Mum

Transwestern/PNM filing (Docket Nos. RP00-249-000 and RP00-249-001):  
Technical conference will take place on June 27, 2000, notwithstanding 
Dynegy's withdrawal of its protest.

Subject: Capacity Options on TW

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.



Appoved.  See the attached which has some minor changes.

Subject: Transwestern Contract Approval Request

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY


Please review the attached non-standard discount letter for Sempra Energy 
Trading Corporation.  Pursuant to Sempra's Gallup Expansion Agreement 
allowing Sempra the right to "call" upon SoCalNeedles capacity, subject to 
availability, at a $.30 rate,  Sempra has requested to obtain 23,000 Dth/d of 
East of Thoreau (EOT) to SoCalNeedles capacity for the July - October term.  
Sempra's blended rate of $.2928 represents 21,500 Dth/d of capacity at 
$.30/Dth (their "call" capacity) and 1,500 Dth/d of additional Needles 
capacity sold to them at $.19/Dth.

Non-standard provisions contained in Sempra's original Gallup expansion 
Agreement  are included in the discount letter and contained in Paragraphs 3 
and 4:

 Paragragh 3 grants Sempra the ability to have alternate delivery points in 
Transwestern's EOT Area at the discounted rate in situations where SoCalGas' 
"window"  can be shown to reduce Sempra's nominated deliveries to SoCalGas.  
Sempra must provide Transwestern a written confirmation from SoCalGas 
indicating a reduction in scheduled volumes in order to obtain such alternate 
delivery capacity at the discounted rate.  If written confirmation is either 
not provided or Sempra elects to transport on an alternate basis to the EOT 
Area due to favorable market conditions, then the rate for such transport 
shall be the discounted rate plus $.01.

Paragragh 4 grants Sempra the ability during the term of the July - October 
transportation agreement, to move their primary delivery point from 
SoCalNeedles to PG&E/Topock, Mojave /Topock, or to the potential SWG 
interconnect subject to capacity availability and a 5 day notification 
period.  Sempra may also have the ability to return to the SoCalNeedles 
delivery during this term subject to the described conditions as well.

Please indicate you approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  If any questions arise, 
please contact me at x35702.



Tony -- here's an excerpt from PG&E's tariff on curtailment of service.



If you are curious about any of the rest of their tariff, see the "Gas Rules" 
portion of their website at

 Tony, here's another page that has a Gas Quality section.
Never fear.  I've asked Janet to set up a meeting on Fri. and to make sure 
the core group of you, Drew, Steve and I can attend.  If anyone else can 
attend too, great.  If not, I'm sure we are going to have more than enough

You know how much I loathe these meetings with the Hee-Haw gang.  This 
telecon/videocon will likely degrade into a raucous Omaha-led circle jerk

If we do this, and you want to include me, you'll have to put it together

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.











I'm saving this message, by the way.  Your characterization of Omaha may be

You know how much I loathe these meetings with the Hee-Haw gang.  This 
telecon/videocon will likely degrade into a raucous Omaha-led circle jerk 
with everyone else, mostly the Houston group, trying to get a word in 
edgewise.  Is there any way to make this more fruitful?

If we do this, and you want to include me, you'll have to put it together 
before close of business Friday as I'm out all next week for surgery.

Hey!  I think I'm planning to come to Austin sometime on Sat.  Bill won't be 
coming with me because he has 3 trial settings on July 3, what a drag.  I 
will probably go home on Mon. afternoon.  Our friends are having their lake 
house party on the 4th.  Tell Jim to bring his gear and we'll go hit some.   
Can't wait to see Gbug!  You know Mema is going to be really excited to see 
her eat carrots.  (I think she's coming in on Sunday.)

I was regressing yesterday and found this website, which I think you would 
appreciate also:

Hi! Fancy hearing from ME! Just checking in to see what your weekend plans
are like when will you be in Austin? Are you bringing Bill? Do you want to
play tennis w/ Jim, etc!  Jim has an appointment to get his fro -glo going
at 12 on Saturday, so we will be hitting Austin that morning and will
probably stay through Sun. evening or possibly Monday morning. They have
decided to give us Monday off, but we still need to get things done around
the house, so we can't loll around in Austin the WHOLE time! Do you know
when Mema will be there? You know, one of these days you are going to get
stuck driving her to Austin! Let me know what's going on! Gbug wants to show
you how she likes to eat her carrots! Mmmmm! And she wants to try out her
boat in the pool.

Bye!
Karin


Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.  Bill 
Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members 
of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present.

 1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention 
that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit 
ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be 
posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale.

 2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be 
determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include 
an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year.

 3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a 
shipper exercises its call option.

 4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission 
policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy 
altogether.

 5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages 
for nonperformance.

 6.  Timeline:
  - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week)
  - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service 
  - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a 
producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing)
  - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require 
Board approval at Enron)
  - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on)
  - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet)

If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to 
get a new draft out by next Friday a.m.Steve, for your information, the case in which the Commission denied ECT's 
petition for a limited waiver of 
the shipper must have title rule appears at 84 FERC P 61,222. Just back in from my front yard -- a military jet of some sort is circling my 
neighborhood and making a tremendous racket!  Several of my neighbors were 
also out, so I was not the only one staring at the sky.  I don't know whether 
we'll see fireworks later or if we've already missed them.  Jose and Gigi's 
party was attended by more kids than ever.  There were a lot of West U 
parents I did not recognize, but there were some lawyers from the Latin 
American section that I know, so we had at least a few people to talk to.  We 
did not stay long, just had some of the good Goode & Company BBQ, helped Gigi 
with the pinatas, and got home around 7.  The traffic on I-45 was really 
starting to pile up so I am glad we left when we did.

Enjoyed the weekend and I'm looking forward to your visit.

Love,
SoozSince I am swamped I've asked Steve Stojic to take a first crack at it.

Subject: Southwest Gas Discount Amendment Changes

Recent negotiations with Southwest Gas Corporation have resulting in the 
deletion of two provisions  contained in the original Southwest Gas 
Corporation discount letter with was routed for Officer Approval.  Several  
minor "sentence structure" changes requested by Southwest Gas have also been 
included.  

Please review the revised Discount Letter and forward any comments 
immediately to either Lorraine Lindberg (x35403) or Susan Scott (x30596).  
The following summarizes the changes to the original discount letter:

1.  Deletion of paragraph which waives ROFR rights.    This paragraph is not 
necessary due to FERC Order 637 rule which states that the shipper's tariff 
right to ROFR for contracts of one year or longer does not apply to 
discounted transportation contracts, only max rate contracts.

2.  Deletion of Paragraph which states Transwestern will retain any capacity 
release revenues which Shipper may acquire from releasing capacity at rates 
above the Discount Rate provided by Transwestern to Shipper.


Please note that the revised discount letter does retain the original intent 
of providing Southwest Gas a 10 year discount rate for seasonal (November 
through March period) capacity from Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) Area 
to the Southwest Gas Interconnect located in the East of California Area.  
The $.10/Dth/d transportation rate shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d for 
the term of the agreement.  Alternate receipt points rights are in the EOT 
Area as with as within the primary path of the contract.  Southwest Gas may 
also utilize the Bloomfield Compressor on an alternate basis.


Lorraine, I have no problem with Larry's proposed change or his reasons for 
the change.  However, I would ask that we eliminate the word "volumetric" as 
that has other connotations in the FERC tariff world.  I.e., if we were truly 
to have "volumetric" rates (like Northern) we'd have to file a whole new rate 
schedule!  I just don't want to use this word.  I don't think it's necessary 
in order to convey Larry's meaning.  Why don't we insert:  "on a daily basis  
only   to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized".  
If Larry wants to talk about it I'm happy to.  If he comes up with any more 
issues I am sending him to law school as punishment.

Lorraine, 
I have your revised letter.? There is only one thing that seems subject to 
possible questions about the intent.? Paragraph 3, last sentence.? I suggest 
it be revised as follows: 

".....and Transwestern's maximum rates shall apply on a daily, volumetric 
basis to the volumes for which such other alternate points are utilized." 

This would reflect how I read the Tariff provisions to apply.? As written 
now, someone could infer that ALL volumes go to max rates whenever ANY 
volumes are moved from/to an unspecified alternate point.? I am visualizing a 
nomination day with part of the volumes from Primary or one of these 
specified points and part of the volumes from some other unspecified 
alternate point. 

Then, just a general question.? Are any of these named alternates also 
delivery points, as well as receipt points?? Are there any delivery points in 
these areas that should be recognized? 

I will talk to you first thing in the morning. 
Thanks. 
Larry

to file the noise survey report.   I will foward a copy to you for your 
records.  Questions, let me know.  Thanks.  Donna

Steve, apparently I'm developing an overactive imagination when it comes to 
FERC decisions.

In Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, 74 FERC ? 61,102, reh'g denied, 75 
FERC ? 61,272 (1996), and Transwestern, 90 FERC P 61,044, in which FERC 
approved LFT services, the Commission accepted the pipelines' statements that 
they would not sell capacity that is not available (i.e., will not 
double-sell), rather than limit the service in some way or reject the filings.

In Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., 79 FERC ? 61,394 (1997), the 
Commission approved of the pipeline's selling of capacity that becomes 
operationally available for various reasons from time to time.

But I have not been able to locate the general statement along the lines of 
"pipelines can use their own discretion to determine whether capacity is 
available" that I thought existed.(I haven't reviewed this yet but will have a chance to this afternoon.)

Here's the draft I referred to in my e-mail -- let me know if you have 
comments or questions.
At PNM's request we are not going to say anything about long-term having a 
higher priority than short-term, because their tariff simply does not reflect 
this.  Unfortunately it would have made our argument stronger if we could 
have said it, but ...

Anyway, I like what Steve has done here.  If there is no objection I'm going 
to have him make the change described above and file it tomorrow.

Susan,  This looks fine to me but I want to confirm one statement.  In 
section 3 on page 3 we state that TW intends to contract for long-term 
capacity vs. short-term capacity and therefore we will have a higher priority 
and will not be the "lowest priority on PNM".  Please confirm that a contract 
for April to October is long term on PNM.  I initially understood we would 
contract for one month with an evergreen provision or rolling month to month 
type of contract therefore I just wanted to make sure this statement fits 
with our Marketing Depts intent.  Thanks.

Glen

Hi Mum!  Ann and I saw "Mr. Ripley" and I lay awake last night wondering how 
else the main character could have dealt with his dilemma on the boat!  I 
think I need to go to the movies more often; perhaps it will help me avoid 
this blurring of film and reality.  My tendency is to really get involved 
when I see them on the big screen!

Might be going to San Francisco next week.  I'd really like to go.  We'll see.

Probably I will come to Austin on Saturday but I've not heard from the 
landscaper yet.  I doubt they will be working on the weekend though.

Hope you're having pretty weather as we have in Houston today.

Love,

Hi Mum.  Sept. 29 sounds great; I have always wanted to see Chorus Line.  So 
go ahead and order tickets if you like.  

I think I might be skiing in the Park City area in December.  Allie's wedding 
is Dec. 16.  at Sundance.  If you and Eric planned your trip then, you and I 
could hit the bunny slopes together.  I want to take lessons, and stick to 
the easy runs.  No way am I getting more injuries; I am creaky enough as it 
is.

Bill is still hoping to go to Sweden in September to buy his Volvo wagon.  I 
have really lost my enthusiasm for the trip and would rather go to Mexico, 
and have told him so.  So I'm not sure what will happen.  Are you interested 
in going to San Miguel for the running of the bulls?

Hope the Hip Abductors are not demanding too much as ransom.

Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz!  What are you doing Sat, Sept 29?  Was just checking over the
Broadway series at the Paramount, and "Chorus Line" is coming for a 2-wk
period.  I would love to see it.  I could probably find someone to go with on
a weeknight, but would prefer going with you if you're available.  Let me
know.  I'll be leaving for Calif a few days later, Oct 3.

Eric had a fatty tumor removed from just under his shoulder Mon.  Called him
when I returned from Houston to check on him and he surprised and shocked me
by saying he was not skiing with his L.A. group this year, and wants me to go
on some ski trips with him.  It's one of those things you wish for, and then
you get it?  Oh no.  I don't even know if I'll really progress past the
beginner slope, but am sure I'll be very good at apres.  I think he's
considering Park City for the first one.  He says the transportation there is
good, and it's a good place for me to learn.

Darrell went with me to The Hills Tues. and I discovered the Hip Abductors!
Wow.  Didn't feel the workout until after my walk last night.  Sure hope all
this is doing some good.  Checked their long list of reciprocal clubs, and
The Met isn't one of them, but that doesn't matter.  You can still go as a
guest.  (Neither is the Los Gatos Ath. Club.)  Must check out exercises for
skiing.

Went to the lab early this a.m. for pre-physical tests.  Had a late lunch
yesterday and no dinner, so I was starved when I woke up.  They opened at
7:00 and there wasn't much of a wait.

Fabion had disappeared for a few weeks, and Mike had lined up another guy to
mow for us, but Fabion showed up--he had been in Mexico.  Sure glad to see
him.  He's from some town near San Miguel.

K, J & G are coming for an overnight Sat.  Karin has a haircut appt.  Glad
for the company.

Mother's a/c went out in her car as she was leaving Austin on the 5th.  All
that way to Houston in the heat.  At least she left early.  She just spent
$800 for a new compressor for that old heap.  Couldn't believe it.  She had
just spent $200 for freon on her previous trip--it all leaked out.  Even with
her other gas guzzler, $1000 would have gone a long way paying for gas.

Hope you're having a good week.  Did Bill make it home?  love, mum

Oops, I meant to send this note to Mary Darveaux instead -- my apologies!

Subject: TW compliance filing

I know you do not want to think about this today, but I'm just thinking ahead 
to next week.  Let's come up with an action plan for drafting TW's Order 637 
compliance filing.  You two should be experts by now!  Give me a call Monday 
or Tuesday, and let's discuss getting started, and I will get to work on a 
draft.  I still have the marked up tariff sheets from when we talked about 
this in March or April.  




Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what 
we have posted before.

One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., 
shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000 
or none at all) constitutes tying.  The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to 
North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.  So if a shipper wants the Needles space 
it has to take the Topock space too.  This looked like a clear case of tying 
to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and 
available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now 
if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the 
Topock space.  That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop 
shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.  This 
is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with 
the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable 
Topock space is part of that package.  

Does this make sense to you?  If not, give me a call.

Subject: Transwestern IOS Approval Request

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY 
INTERACTIVE OPEN SEASON 
APPROVAL REQUEST


Please review the attached file for the announcement of Transwestern's 
Interactive Open Season (IOS) to be held Friday, July 21, 2000.  The 
following summarizes the bidding rules and capacity definition for the two 
bid packages of East of Thoreau (EOT) to California capacity:

 Package 1:
 Volume: 20,000 Dth/d
 Term:  3 months (August - October, 2000)
 Path:  East of Thoreau to California.  Maximum available delivery capacity 
   of 12,000 Dth/d at Needles, Ca.  Remaining may be chosen between
   PG&E and Mojave.
 
Package 2:
 Volume: 49,000 Dth/d
 Term:  12 Months (November 1, 2000 - Oct. 31, 2001)
 Path:  East of Thoreau to California.  Maximum available delivery capacity
   of 35,000 Dth/d at Needles, Cal.  Remaining may be chosen between
   PG&E and Mojave.

Bidders may bid on either a 1-part or a 2-part rate structure for the entire 
capacity amount posted.   No partial volume bids are accepted.  Bid packages 
are considered mutually exclusive.     No minimum bid rate is posted 
therefore Transwestern is not obligated to accept any bids if the bids are 
valued as unacceptable.  Transwestern shall award capacity based upon Highest 
Rate criteria.

If any questions arise please contact Christine Stokes at x35702.

Please indicated approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.

   



I spoke with Steve Stojic about this and he had the same concern.  Even 
though I was trying to keep this out of the new rate schedule requirements by 
not making it a rate schedule, I believe I still managed to cover many 
checklist items.  One that is not covered is testimony similar to what might 
be filed in a rate case, in order to justify market based rates.  We are 
planning to include a revenue estimate.  I'll go over these and make sure 
everything is addressed before filing.

Are you OK with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint?  The 
marketers want to start giving a draft to customers for them to review 
beginning TODAY.

Subject: Re: TW Capacity Options  

Susan, 

 In reviewing the proposed filing I had some questions.  On page 2 in the 
discussion of ensuring sufficient capacity we offer to establish position 
guidelines, do we need to outline these and either include them as an exhibit 
or have them ready for reply to either protesters or a staff data request?  
Secondly, if we regard this as a new service does our filing comply with all 
aspects of 154.202 (a) (ii), (iii), (iv) (A) & (B), (v), (vi), (viii) and 
(ix)?  In recent filings the staff has challenged our filings in terms of 
addressing each of these requirements.  I believe many our covered but 
thought you might like to double check for compliance.  What about a revenue 
estimate? Seems like we need one, even if its still very speculative.

Glen

Please ignore what I sent you last night and post this instead; it has just a 
couple of typo. changes. Thank you!

& I will send it to the Commercial Group, so you do not need to.







Our consulting agreement with IGS for services related to the CPUC proceeding 
expired 12/31/99 but can be continued by mutual agreement of the parties.  
Given the upcoming proceedings, I'd recommend that we act on this sooner 
rather than later...let me know and I'll draft a brief letter to Mark 
Baldwin.David Foti, currently of ET&S, has accepted a position at EES effective 
August 1, 2000.  To ensure that ET&S continues to be in compliance with the 
marketing affiliate rules, Dave's access to any ET&S or GPG-related LANs or 
applications should be removed at the close of business on July 31.  In 
addition, Dave's email profile should be changed and any GPG or ET&S mass 
distribution  lists should be changed.  

Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, 
verifying and indicating the date that employee was:
- removed from the LAN
- EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable)
- removed from ET&S or GPG-related applications
- email post office box was transfered.

If you have questions, or if you believe there is someone else I need to 
contact in order to accomplish the above, please let me know.According to my research, this project (which involves construction by TW of 
a lateral consisting of about 40 miles of at least 16" pipe to provide 
service to a power plant) would require a 7(c) certificate.  Do you concur?  
Any comments?

Subject: Caithness Big Sandy LLC

TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting 
between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of 
the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving 
the project forward.

Caithness Corporation
Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety 
of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for 
private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of 
generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind 
in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina 
jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.

Big Sandy Project
The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, 
Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 
MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 
170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.

The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of 
Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near 
valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 
#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state 
highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of 
Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV 
transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one 
of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends 
from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've 
included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a 
water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant 
will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have 
currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power 
plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the 
wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface 
water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the 
Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.

The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and 
associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area 
includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited 
agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an 
estimated population of 200.

Project Schedule
Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000
Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000
Arrange financing     December 2000
EIS approval      March 2001
Construction begins     April 2001
Testing begins      July 2002
Commercial Operation     November 2002

There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power 
Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known 
to be present in the area.

Lateral Pipeline Alignment
The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The 
alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed 
next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department 
of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement 
for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right 
of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only 
a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines 
require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent 
right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this 
alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.

If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second 
alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section 
line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the 
routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly 
necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve 
following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue 
there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is 
whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high 
pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.

Other Preliminary Project Issues
There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to 
interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern 
mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both 
of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original 
estimate to construct a 16" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was 
based on the following specifications:

120 MMcf/d
450 psig delivery pressure,
900 psig inlet pressure

The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a 
higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse 
turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at 
a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate 
EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the 
design will likely change to a 20" pipeline.

Next Steps (responsible party/department)
 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Pipeline Alignment
1. Estimate to plot lateral pipeline route.     8/4  Matthews/Chanley
2. Engineering services agreement    8/4  Scott/Fawcett
3. Final alignment sheets.    8/25  Matthews/Chanley

Misc. Items
1.   Confidentiality Agreement   7/24  Scott/Fawcett
2. Data items to Caithness
 -  Form 567     7/26  Matthews
 -  Gallup FERC filing (flow diagram)  7/26  Scott
 -  Sta. 1 and Needles flow/pressure data  7/28  Matthews
 -  Outage reports/maintenance schedules 7/28  Matthews

Engineering/Design
1.   Original estimate (16" line) to Caithness  7/24  Matthews
2.  Revised specifications to Transwestern  7/28  Caithness (T.P.)
3.   Revised estimate (20" line) to Caithness    8/4  Matthews/Chanley 

Other Issues
Several key issues need to be addressed concurrently with the pipeline 
alignment and engineering activities:

 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Deal Structuring
1. Financing/cost amortization     9/8  Fawcett/Hayslett
/Centilli/Goodrow
2. Research interconnect policy (EPNG)    8/4  Scott/Regulatory
3. Research 7(c) application requirements  8/11  Scott/Regulatory
4. Rates      9/22  Scott/Regulatory
/Centilli
5. Research open season requirements  8/18  Scott/Regulatory

The above list is certainly not meant to be all-inclusive and a kick-off 
meeting to discuss the project schedule will be put together shortly.  In the 
meantime, if you have any questions regarding this project, please let me 
know.  Also, please feel free to forward this memo to anyone I've 
inadvertently left off the distribution.  Thanks.  




After our IOS adventure last week, I put together the following questions=
=20
that need to be resolved.  Some of them have needed to be resolved for quit=
e=20
some time.  Tony, let's talk since I think some of these have already been=
=20
discussed and maybe resolved in the context of developing TW's EnronOnline=
=20
site, and I just need to get up to speed.  To the extent there aren't answe=
rs=20
yet, I'll get busy researching.  Drew -- comments?  Shall we all get on the=
=20
phone & discuss this?

List of TW contracting issues

1.  Reevaluate the following in the context of current FERC negotiated rate=
=20
policy:

 a.  Transwestern's current form discount letter states:  "[t]he total char=
ge=20
shall include all applicable surcharges."   Should this language be revised=
,=20
and if so, how?

 b.  Transwestern usually charges one-part rates, and includes language in=
=20
its discount letter stating that Transwestern shall allocate the combined=
=20
rate between the reservation and commodity components inclusive of=20
surcharges.  Are one-part rates really negotiated rates?  material deviatio=
ns=20
from the tariff?=20

 c.  Transwestern's discount letter includes a statement that in no event=
=20
shall the contract rate be greater than the maximum or lower than the minim=
um=20
rates provided in Transwestern=01,s tariff.  This was intended as assurance=
 that=20
the contract is not a negotiated rate.  Is this language still effective? =
=20
necessary?

2.  IOS/EnronOnline:

 a.  When should IOS be conducted, if at all?

 b.  Once notice of IOS or EnronOnline bidding has been posted, can the=20
subject capacity still be sold off-line (i.e., pursuant to traditional=20
bidding procedures)?

 c.  Is our system for IOS and EnronOnline set up to handle max rate biddin=
g=20
situations in a nondiscriminatory manner and in compliance with the bid=20
evaluation procedures in the tariff?  If not, what changes need to be made?Tony, the idea we had discussed at our meeting with Drew was somehow 
acquiring capacity on El Paso in order to access the South Needles 
interconnect with SoCal.  Currently SoCal lets El Paso deliver to S. Needles 
but does not extend the same privilege to TW.    

I'm unsure how it would work.  TW does have a couple of interconnects with El 
Paso's system.  I would simply say in the memo that one solution to the 
constraint at Topock might be to get some shippers to switch to South 
Needles, and deliver gas to South Needles after twisting SoCal's arm and 
letting us in, or somehow acquiring capacity on El Paso (or otherwise using 
their system) to access South Needles.  Obviously we will need to flesh this 
out from an economic, regulatory and legal standpoint.  I will discuss it 
with Jeff when he returns.  My apologies for the delay.  Call if you have any 
questions or comments to discuss!  

S.No probola!  It will be good to have an excuse to go to NM.  Maybe I will go 
this weekend.

So glad you had rain over the weekend!  We did too, and we had had a dry 
spell for almost as long.  I hope it was not too late to save my back yard, 
which was starting to smell like cooked grass.

Bill and I are on the outs.  He just will not do what he needs to in order to 
make things work, so I have given up.  Of course now he is trying to be 
charming.  Anyway, I will have to tell you the whole story some other time.

The kiddies are going back to school already so now would be a good time to 
plan a trip to D.C. at last.  Maybe early Sept?
Also I'd be game for a girls' trip to Destin.

Time to work!
Love,
Sooz

Hi, Sooz,

Don't make a special trip, but the next time you're at the Galleria, would
you go by the Neiman's Clientele make-up counter (by the candy) and get
something for me?  Clientele Wrinkle Treatment.  It'll be pricy, but just let
me know and I'll get a check to you.
love, mum

Ken, here are the confidentiality agreements that should be signed prior to 
our providing information to our vendors.  Each agreement should be printed 
as duplicate originals on TW letterhead, and signed by an officer of TW.  I 
understand that Mike Nelson is out due to a death in the family; Steve Harris 
is out this week also.  Perhaps Julia White would be willing to sign in order 
to expedite things.

If you have any questions or need further assistance with any aspect of these 
agreements please do not hesitate to call (x30596) or come by.
Well, Larry just won't let go of these contract issues, will he??
I believe the answer is that SWGas will always be billed based on the 
one-part rate, regardless of how we choose to allocate the rate components.  
My understanding is that the reason we reserve the right to allocate the 
components is simply for internal accounting purposes, to keep any one 
component from exceeding the max or going below the min.
Hope this helps; let me know if you have further questions!

blood pressure for only the esoteric things.  (Just kidding.)  I'm very
pleased we finally got this done.  Now for the pipe wrench and welder
folks to get the physical jobs done, as well.

Unfortunately, the work is never over.  I will now try to concentrate on
the OBA, which has been sitting by the sideline for a long time.  Will
get back to you on that as soon as I can.

As for the TSA rate, I have a few questions.  We have agreed that TWPL
would allocate the rate between fixed and variable components.  I have
never been clear on just when and how that will be done.  I have assumed
you would make that call, let us know, and it would be over.  Is there
any idea that issue would be a changing thing, or is it "once done,
always done"?  Further, what factors do you use to make that
determination and what, if any, rules and regulations apply?  From
different views, I'd like to have it all variable and you would like to
have it all fixed.  What is the process here?

I will get back to you soon on the OBA stuff.  Meanwhile, chill that
champagne!

Subject: Re: Caithness Big Sandy LLC  

The prior notice blanket was a possibility, but with the change in diameters 
it most likely won't work.  I agree with you a 7 (c) filing would be 
required.  I noticed they are discussing environmental information below, but 
what is the status of preparing the reports?  If we are to make the filing, 
we need a meeting to make sure that everyone is gathering the proper 
information.  In some of our other filings we conducted town hall meetings 
prior to survey work to gain support of the people.  This should be being.  

A question I have is "will the mainline need to be expanded?"  How do they 
plan to serve the load from a fully subscribed pipe? (I believe it is fully 
subscribed)

Thanks 
Keith

According to my research, this project (which involves construction by TW of 
a lateral consisting of about 40 miles of at least 16" pipe to provide

Subject: Caithness Big Sandy LLC

TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting 
between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of 
the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving 
the project forward.

Caithness Corporation
Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety 
of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for 
private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of 
generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind 
in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina 
jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.

Big Sandy Project
The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, 
Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 
MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 
170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.

The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of 
Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near 
valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 
#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state 
highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of 
Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV 
transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one 
of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends 
from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've 
included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a 
water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant 
will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have 
currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power 
plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the 
wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface 
water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the 
Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.

The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and 
associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area 
includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited 
agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an 
estimated population of 200.

Project Schedule
Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000
Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000
Arrange financing     December 2000
EIS approval      March 2001
Construction begins     April 2001
Testing begins      July 2002
Commercial Operation     November 2002

There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power 
Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known 
to be present in the area.

Lateral Pipeline Alignment
The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The 
alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed 
next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department 
of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement 
for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right 
of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only 
a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines 
require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent 
right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this 
alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.

If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second 
alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section 
line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the 
routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly 
necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve 
following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue 
there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is 
whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high 
pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.

Other Preliminary Project Issues
There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to 
interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern 
mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both 
of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original 
estimate to construct a 16" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was 
based on the following specifications:

120 MMcf/d
450 psig delivery pressure,
900 psig inlet pressure

The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a 
higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse 
turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at 
a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate 
EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the 
design will likely change to a 20" pipeline.

Next Steps (responsible party/department)
 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Pipeline Alignment
1. Estimate to plot lateral pipeline route.     8/4  Matthews/Chanley
2. Engineering services agreement    8/4  Scott/Fawcett
3. Final alignment sheets.    8/25  Matthews/Chanley

Misc. Items
1.   Confidentiality Agreement   7/24  Scott/Fawcett
2. Data items to Caithness
 -  Form 567     7/26  Matthews
 -  Gallup FERC filing (flow diagram)  7/26  Scott
 -  Sta. 1 and Needles flow/pressure data  7/28  Matthews
 -  Outage reports/maintenance schedules 7/28  Matthews

Engineering/Design
1.   Original estimate (16" line) to Caithness  7/24  Matthews
2.  Revised specifications to Transwestern  7/28  Caithness (T.P.)
3.   Revised estimate (20" line) to Caithness    8/4  Matthews/Chanley 

Other Issues
Several key issues need to be addressed concurrently with the pipeline 
alignment and engineering activities:

 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Deal Structuring
1. Financing/cost amortization     9/8  Fawcett/Hayslett
/Centilli/Goodrow
2. Research interconnect policy (EPNG)    8/4  Scott/Regulatory
3. Research 7(c) application requirements  8/11  Scott/Regulatory
4. Rates      9/22  Scott/Regulatory
/Centilli
5. Research open season requirements  8/18  Scott/Regulatory

The above list is certainly not meant to be all-inclusive and a kick-off 
meeting to discuss the project schedule will be put together shortly.  In the 
meantime, if you have any questions regarding this project, please let me 
know.  Also, please feel free to forward this memo to anyone I've 
inadvertently left off the distribution.  Thanks.  










I've reviewed the IGS market development agreement pursuant to your request.  
It expires 2/29/00.  The agreement requires the parties to meet 90 days prior 
to that date for the purpose of discussing an extension but does not obligate 
us to agree to any such extension.  

As you know, I have a conflict tomorrow at 10, but would be happy to provide 
any other information you need for the meeting.  This should be so much easier; Foti is not cooperating so I am having to 
spend time hunting down his Co. # and RC #, which hopefully Estalee will be 
able to provide.  I reiterate my position that lawyers are not the ones who 
should have to do this.  Rest assured I'll follow through on this one and Lia 
Hernandez, but I also feel we need to approach Dave Schafer and ask why this 
is something HR is not capable of taking care of.

David Foti, currently of ET&S, has accepted a position at EES effective 
August 1, 2000.  To ensure that ET&S continues to be in compliance with the 
marketing affiliate rules, Dave's access to any ET&S or GPG-related LANs or 
applications should be removed at the close of business on July 31.  In 
addition, Dave's email profile should be changed and any GPG or ET&S mass 
distribution  lists should be changed.  

Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, 
verifying and indicating the date that employee was:
- removed from the LAN
- EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable)
- removed from ET&S or GPG-related applications
- email post office box was transfered.

If you have questions, or if you believe there is someone else I need to 
contact in order to accomplish the above, please let me know.



Needs to be an officer or someone with power of attorney.  Ordinarily, you do 
not have power of attorney unless there is board of director approval 
authorizing you to sign contracts on behalf of the company.  
The point is to make sure someone signs it who is authorized to bind the 
company to the obligations of the agreement; otherwise they could argue later 
that the agreement is not valid.

Comments?






Here is the agreement with the changes you requested.Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.  Significant 
changes include:

- added definition of Counterparty
- added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect 
compliance with 154.202
- included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated 
rate
- added an example of how options will work

I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option 
fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the 
fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the 
Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate 
because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be 
nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from 
the market.  

Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?  I will 
have Janet call to determine your availability.

Christine, see the attached.  I've changed paragraph 8 to be like our last 
posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but 
omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time).

My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand 
how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated.  As 
currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on 
use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our 
granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.  If we do 
intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted 
rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5).  

If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much 
of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate.

Any questions -- give me a call.

Lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the Val Verde contract, and 
my initial impressions.  Let's talk more about how to approach the issue 
after we meet with Ron tomorrow about MAOP.

12/31/92 Interconnect Agreement:

Sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to 
provide firm compression service TW will accept up to 200,000 on an 
interruptible basis.

Sec. 2 states that the Blanco Hub MAOP shall not be exceeded.

Sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages).

The contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause.

2/18/93 letter amendment:

Sec. 3 obligates TW to provide firm compression service in order to accept 
200,000 into TW's system (provided MOGI has pressure of at least 650 and 
quantity of at least 140).  Acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide 
firm compression in accordance with Sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement.

9/25/95 letter amendment:

Increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the San 
Juan expansion is effective.

My initial conclusions:  It is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 
250,000 on a firm basis, provided that Burlington complies with the pressure 
requirements.  Probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if 
accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub MAOP.  In that case we can 
argue impossibility of performance.  Also, we could avoid the obligation 
because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force 
majeure.  This argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to 
have gotten hotter over the years.  

The fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with Burlington in 
January of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say 
we should have known by now).  Burlington might try to argue that we have an 
absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive 
system modifications.  That argument is not a very strong one because the 
agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly 
describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement. In Mark Baldwin's June 19 letter, he proposed the following fee schedule for 
project development:

Retainer:  $1000/month plus expenses
Accepted project (meets TW's predetermined financial hurdles):  Proposal $5000
Each month TW actively negotiating project:  $1500/month (each project)
Letter of Intent:  $5000
Signed Agreement:  $10,000
 Incentive Fee:  To be determined

 When I spoke with Mark, he explained that this schedule was based on 
reaching certain milestones in the development of individual projects.  In 
his letter he also proposed monthly fees for regulatory services ($5000/mo.) 
and market development services (including SoCal OIR related services -- 
$3000/mo.).  This e-mail addresses the project development fee structure 
only. 

 The recently expired Market Development agreement with IGS provided for a 
one-time retainer of $15,000 and a monthly retainer of $5000, plus expenses, 
and an incentive fee structure for any agreement between Transwestern and 
third party "identified by IGS under this agreement."  As you know, the 
"identified by" language presented us with some ambiguity in the case of the 
Southern Energy Gallup Expansion contract, in which both IGS and the TW 
Commercial Group worked on the deal.  Fortunately, the ambiguity worked to 
Transwestern's advantage in that case, but my understanding is that in 
ongoing dealings with IGS both parties would prefer more specificity in any 
future consulting agreement.

 Mark's proposal represents a step in the right direction because it provides 
for payment on a per-project basis.  This immediately eliminates the 
"identified by" problem because we won't be obligated to pay him unless and 
until he identifies a project we're interested in him working on.

 I propose that we define some general terms and conditions in an enabling 
agreement.  If Mark brings us a project we want to pursue, we will pay him 
according to these terms (and any other terms and conditions tailored to the 
specific project, as needed).  For each project, we would simply enter into a 
short letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement.  I've outlined the 
agreement below as a starting point for discussion.  The numbers are Mark's; 
we'll have to discuss whether they are appropriate.  I've omitted any payment 
for a letter of intent because since they are nonbinding, letters of intent 
are of little value to Transwestern.

  Call me after you've reviewed this and let's discuss how you want to 
proceed.



From time to time during the term of the enabling agreement, IGS may present 
brief, preliminary project proposals to Transwestern.  If Transwestern 
desires IGS's assistance in developing a particular project, it will so 
notify IGS in writing and shall execute an agreement with IGS adopting the 
following terms and conditions:

1.  Retainer for project development:  $1000/month plus expenses.  Project 
development shall include but not be limited to:  research, due diligence, 
market analysis, negotiation with counterparties (to the extent specifically 
authorized by Transwestern), reporting to marketing representatives of 
Transwestern as requested by Transwestern, and preparing a detailed written 
proposal.  Transwestern and IGS may agree in writing to other 
project-specific requirements.  Transwestern shall continue to pay the 
retainer each month until a definitive agreement is signed with the 
counterparty or Transwestern notifies IGS in writing that it has decided to 
terminate the project.  

2.  If Transwestern accepts the project described in IGS's written proposal 
(or with modifications after reviewing the written proposal), it shall pay 
IGS a fee of [the lesser of] $5000 [or ___% of the net present value of the 
project].  "Accepting the project" means that the project meets 
Transwestern's financial, regulatory and other criteria and the Transwestern 
Commercial Group has obtained the necessary officer approval to pursue the 
project to completion.  Accepting the project and paying IGS pursuant to this 
paragraph in no way obligates Transwestern to pursue the project to 
completion.

3.  If Transwestern signs a definitive agreement with a counterparty for the 
project, it shall pay IGS $10,000.  Additionally, the parties may negotiate 
an additional incentive fee (to be agreed upon and documented at the outset 
of the project).

(I will also include provisions on termination, confidentiality, etc.).

Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.

There are a couple of important changes from the last draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
"market-based."  At FERC, the term "market-based" has connotations of having 
to prove to FERC that a non-cost-based rate is appropriate because we lack 
market power.  While we probably do lack market power, the consensus of the 
legal/regulatory team was to try to portray the option fee as a built-in 
feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated into a 
separate option fee.  If this theory is not clear to you after you read the 
filing letter, let's discuss how it should be improved.

The other significant change (also based on my meeting with legal/regulatory) 
is that I've structured the tariff language and the agreement so that every 
shipper, regardless of whether they currently use transport on TW, will have 
to have a firm transportation agreement when they buy an option.  In other 
words, a shipper that does not currently have a service agreement will simply 
execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  This structure has two 
advantages:  1) it's consistent with our option-fee-as-part-of-transport-rate 
theory, and 2) it will help support that theory in our next rate case.

I'd like to meet next week, either Wednesday afternoon or Thursday, to 
discuss the following topics:

1)  Your comments and questions on this draft,
2)  Some examples of options, to make sure the tariff provisions and contract 
work from a logistical standpoint,
3)  The bidding process, and how bids for options will be evaluated, and
4)  Comments received from shippers thus far.

I'll be working on 41 tomorrow; let's talk about what would be a good meeting 
time.
I will be out Mon. and Tues.
Here is a chart cross-referencing Gas Daily price points with points of TW, 
for purposes of imbalance valuation.  If you have questions call Jeff or me.

Subject: New TW price points

Susan,
As requested in yesterday's meeting, Lindy and I came up with the attached 
matrix of prices for purposes of valuing TW imbalances.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.


Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  After 
our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last 
draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
"market-based."   Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a 
built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated 
into a separate option fee.  

The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and 
the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use 
transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they 
buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a 
service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  If 
you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know.

I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some 
examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from 
a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options 
will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll 
circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas 
or questions.

As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing 
in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable 
meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some 
concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final 
tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss 
their questions?  Let me know what you think.

Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting 
first, and when FERC staff is available to talk.




Yesterday Jeff Fawcett, Lee Ferrell and I met with Dynegy marketing and 
legal/regulatory representatives regarding TW Transport Options.  Overall the 
meeting was very positive.  We had nothing but encouraging remarks from the 
marketing representatives.  However, the regulatory people (Sarah Tomalty, Ed 
Ross) had a couple of issues.  The biggest issue is a marketing affiliate 
concern.  Apparently Dynegy is on a crusade at FERC to place further limits 
on deals pipelines can do with their marketing affiliates.  They have run 
into situations in which pipelines (examples:  Koch, El Paso) have blatantly 
favored their marketing affiliates to the extent that Dynegy cannot even do 
deals with them.  (In fact, one of the problems with Koch has been Koch's 
price option deals with its affiliate.)  The perception is that the 
affiliates, by using "funny money," can always make themselves the highest 
bidder, with a net benefit to the entire organization (pipeline + 
affiliate).  The remedy Dynegy is proposing is to require a marketing 
affiliate, if it is the highest bidder, to credit back the difference between 
the price it pays and the price offered by the next highest bidder.  The 
presumption is that the affiliate has an unfair advantage because it is able 
to pay above market value in order to get the capacity.   Dynegy's proposal 
would encourage affiliates to pay "real" dollars.  

While it emphasized its belief that TW does not favor its marketing 
affiliates, Dynegy would like for us to include in our filing some limitation 
on options transactions with marketing affiliates.   It is likely that other 
pipelines will file for the ability to sell options once FERC approves our 
filing, and Dynegy would like for this type of protection to be part of the 
precedent set by our filing.  Ed hinted that FERC may be considering a 
divestiture requirement for marketing affiliates, and that pipelines can 
avoid this extreme result by voluntarily limiting their transactions with 
affiliates.  Shelley, I know you've discussed this issue with Ed already and 
our reactions were the same.  Basically we politely told Dynegy that we don't 
believe we're part of the problem and that we are therefore not inclined to 
unnecessarily disadvantage our company by further limiting ENA's ability to 
do business with TW.   We can probably expect an intervention with comments 
or a limited protest addressing the issue.

The other regulatory question was whether we intend to file each option deal 
as a negotiated rate.  My analysis of this issue is that since we're 
proposing the option fee as part of the transport rate, options would always 
be a type of negotiated rate and would need to be filed.  If you think this 
is not the right answer, please let me know because we need to decide it 
before we file the tariff sheets.  Sarah's question seemed to be more one of 
curiosity rather than a basis for protest.

Like the Indicated Shippers, Dynegy appeared interested in an all-customer 
meeting to discuss the service.  Jeff and the rest of the commercial group 
are looking further into whether and when we would have such a meeting. 

If you have any questions or concerns please let me know.I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect 
agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take 
the following steps:

1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13 
of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) 
provides that either party may terminate the OBA "at the end of the primary 
term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice" to 
Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since 
gone month-to-month.)

2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect 
agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92 
Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either 
party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary 
term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire 
until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement "may 
be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in 
the event the OBA between the parties is terminated."

As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme 
measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh 
our other options first.  Let me know if you have further questions.Drew -- here is Lorraine's update on the Val Verde situation that I mentioned 
in my previous e-mail.   Recall that we've been unable to accept quantities 
of gas from Burlington because of the high temperatures at the interconnect 
in recent years.  I've recommended that we seek amendment of the contract as 
soon as possible to reflect what we CAN do.  

The proposed amendment Lorraine is referring to, which Burlington rejected, 
modified our obligation to provide firm compression sufficient to accept 
250,000 MMBtu.  

//
Burlington Resources - Val Verde Plant - Michelle and I had a follow-up 
conversation with BR Thursday.  I faxed the proposed amendment to BR Monday 
and we hadn't heard from them yet.  They claim approximately $135,000/month 
in lost revenues because we are holding their production down.  Michele and 
Darrell will work to pull together the data on exactly which days we have not 
been able to take BR's gas.  I mentioned to BR that we were putting this info 
together, but they claim since they were told to back off to 180,000 - 
190,000 MMBtu from about mid-June through July, our data would not accurately 
reflect BR's inability to schedule in excess of 180/190.  They will not 
accept our wording in the interconnect amendment, specifically "best efforts" 
and "subject to operating conditions on TW", so we will need to revise this 
further.

We offered alternate receipt point flexibility at Ignacio and alternate 
delivery point flexibility at El Paso Blanco on their Jackrabbit contract but 
they do not think this is sufficient to agree to amend the interconnect 
agreement.  They have suggested we consider giving them a deeper discount on 
their San Juan - Waha contract (80,000/d, $0.14, term 11/30/06).  

The ball is in our court.  John, I think that sounds fine.
I really have no other comments on the org chart or job descriptions.
Thanks so much for your help!

Subject: Transwestern org chart

I just met with Steve Harris to review the Transwestern Commercial Group job 
descriptions and proposed organization chart.  He agreed with the wording of 
the job descriptions but suggested that the TW employees currently working in 
NNG's Business Development and Marketing organization be shown on the 
Transwestern organization chart in a dotted line reporting relationship to 
him.  A footnote would identify them as 

"Transwestern employees located in the NNG Business Development & Marketing 
organization which serves as a resource to support the TW Commercial Group in 
the areas of Risk Management, Pricing & Structuring, Business Development, 
Market Analysis and Government Affairs"

Steve also indicated that a TW employee will also be hired in the next few 
days to fill a Regional Mgr Government Affairs job currently located in Mike 
McGowen's group and that this job should also be placed in a dotted line 
relationship reporting to him.  The existing footnote could be revised to 
recognize this job as well. 

After talking to Steve I feel that the above would be the best and least 
confusing way to portray Transwestern employees in an on-line organization 
chart.  In this regard I have again revised the Transwestern Commercial 
organization chart and will deliver/fax it this afternoon to you both for 
your review and comments.

John A

Rich, would you please add Tim Aron to your distribution list for the Gallup 
Weekly Updates, and also forward him your latest?  He is working on New 
Mexico regulatory and legislative issues pertaining to our compression 
contract, and I thought your updates would help keep him in the loop.  Thank 
you.First of all, I'm delighted you want to stay and would not have a problem 
with Deron moving in.  However, in return I would ask for increased rent of 
$650, to take into account the improvements you want and additional water use 
and wear & tear.  After you read this let me know whether you think this is 
reasonable.

I'll try to answer all your questions:

Q. I believe you had mentioned some termite issues and I wanted to
make sure that we would not be doing anything to cause the floor to collapse 
as
we would be removing light items for heavier items. 

A.  I really do not think it is a problem.  In addition to the oak floor, 
there is a subfloor, so heavier items should be fine.  I'd draw the line at a 
waterbed, though!

Q.  The stove is a bit problematic... 

A.  No problem to look into this.  I'm sure it can be repaired.  I will give 
the appliance folks a call.  

Q.  Do you know if the garage apt. would support a 2nd line being installed? 

A.  I'm sure it will...go ahead and do it; if the phone company runs into any 
internal wiring problems let me know and I'll call my phone wiring dude.

Q.  Do you know if the washer/dryer connections in the garage part work for 
sure?

A.  I have a bad feeling about those connections!  I'll get them up and 
running, and can get someone to haul the old washer off.

Q.  I am guessing that they would need to be gas, not electric? 

A.  I would strongly recommend a gas dryer because it is so much more 
economical.  Plus you would not believe how much faster you can get jeans and 
towels dry than with electric!
If I have to get a new connection installed it will be gas if possible.

Q.  At one point, you had mentioned doing something with the kitchen floor as 
the linoleum has seen better days... Would it be possible to look into this?

A.  I have always thought linoleum in a black & white checkerboard pattern 
would look really cute in there.  It's cheap to install and fairly easy 
except I'm leary of taking on the project myself because pulling up the old 
stuff is going to be a you-know-what.  I will call & ask my handyman, unless 
you and Deron are just dying to do it yourselves.

Q.  Do you know if any paint is leftover?

A.  The color I used on the trim was Antique White semigloss; there should be 
some left in the garage.  I'll check and if not I can pick up some for you at 
the paint store as I'll be going there this week or this weekend.

The only additional issue I have is parking -- Dianna is staying with me and 
helping w/rent for the next several months and I'd like her to be able to use 
that middle space.  I know it's a pain but either you or Deron would have to 
park on the street.  The other option is to get one of the back garage doors 
working so there is access to the garage from the alley.  If I did this do 
you think y'all would use it, or is that too impractical?

As for timing with the oven, W/D connections and kitchen floor, I'm taking 
the first full week of Sept. off and it would be easiest for me to get 
everything done then if that's okay with y'all.

Call if you have further questions!

I agree that the proposed facilities could be constructed under the prior 
notice provisions of TW's blanket certificate if the cost and environmental 
requirements are met.  The facilities appear to meet the criteria for an 
"eligible facility" under section 157.202(b)(2)(i):  they are necessary to 
provide service to Big Sandy within existing mainline certificate levels, and 
according to my research the facilities are similar to those that the 
Commission routinely has found to be eligible under a blanket certificate.  
The prior notice project cost limit for year 2000 is $20,200,000.  (Sec. 
157.208).  If the project is not within this cost limit we will need to seek 
a 7(c) certificate.  

I've researched the incremental rate question and here's what I've been able 
to find out:

In the context of a 7(c) application, FERC generally requires use of existing 
Part 284 rates.  This was the case when TW applied for a certificate to 
construct the San Juan lateral.  TW requested a separate zone rate for the 
lateral in that proceeding but FERC stated that a section 7 proceeding was 
not the appropriate forum.  The Commission stated, however, that it would be 
willing to entertain an abbreviated Section 4 filing by TW to revise its Part 
284 rates to inclue zone rates for the lateral.  So TW made a Section 4 
filing and got zone rates approved based on the cost of service for the 
lateral. 

Whether we construct the Big Sandy lateral under the blanket certificate or 
not, it appears that we would have to file a limited section 4 if we want to 
implement rates for the lateral that are different from the West of Thoreau 
rates.

As for whether an open season would be required, I assume it would not be if 
Caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral.  However, 
if other shippers are interested and we want to get the best rate we'll 
probably want to have an open season.  In any event, in the context of a 7(c) 
application FERC is going to put us at risk for recovery of costs, so it 
would be to our advantage to sell 100% of the new capacity.

At this point I am uncertain whether we even want or need different rates for 
the Big Sandy lateral...ultimately it will depend on the cost of the project 
and what rates would make it economic for TW to proceed.

I hope this helps...if there are further questions or if any of this does not 
sound right to you let me know.

Subject: Re: Caithness Big Sandy, LLC. Project  

As you are aware, Transwestern is working with a shipper to potentially 
provide service to a new power plant located approximately 40 miles off the 
mainline in Arizona.  Although, the final negotiation are not complete 
certain options are being evaluated, I need some assistance in interpreting 
the regulations regarding the authority we should use for approval of this 
project.  

The facilities that would be constructed include a delivery point and 
approximately 40 miles of pipe.  As these facilities are non-mainline, it may 
be possible to construct the proposed facilities under the prior notice 
provisions of TW's blanket certificate, provided the project satisfies the 
blanket criteria (generally costs and environmental).

With this in mind, I have the following issues and questions:

Preliminarily, marketing is thinking that we may want to develop an 
incremental rate  to recover the cost of the project.

Would a new incremental rate for this service impact our ability to file for 
approval under the prior notice provisions?  Note: Generally, Subpart F of 
Part 157 (blanket regulations) does not address service issues as 
transportation service is provided under Part 284 of the Commission's 
regulations.  However, the regulations (o157.204)  set forth Who may apply 
for a blanket certificate.   The criteria includes, among other things, any 
interstate pipeline that has rates accepted by the Commission.  Therefore, 
would an incremental rate have to be approved by the Commission before the 
proposed facilities would be blanket eligible?

Can a new incremental rate be established through a limit-section 4 rate 
filing or is a case-specific certificate required?

As the facilities will not include any mainline expansion - Is an open season 
required for the project?  My opinion is "NO".  Do you agree?

Your thoughts and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks MW

Somehow the "one-part rate" glossary item fell off of TW's list so I've 
revised it again.
I owe Michele a call because she has a couple of questions.  Will do after I 
finish options draft.

Janet, please meet with Denise (tomorrow if possible) to:

- explain filing system
- hand off filing projects you are working on (anytime between tomorrow and 
next week is fine)
- explain how you do service lists for FERC filings.

Also, one of you will need to contact the appropriate person to get Denise 
access to my Lotus Organizer.
Don't know how to notify the mailroom people to deliver my mail to Denise's 
station but see if you can do this also.

I spoke with Mike, and Emily is going to handle moving the phones.

Merci beaucoup!Denise, here are a few things off the top of my head.

1.  I mostly work for the Transwestern Commercial Group, which is the 
following cast of characters:

Steve Harris
Kevin Hyatt
Lindy Donoho
Jeff Fawcett
TK Lohman
Christine Stokes
Michelle Lokay
Lorraine Lindberg

When I am not on 47, I sit near their work area on 41 (and forward my phone 
to x34516).  These are the people I'm most likely to have you organize 
meetings with, distribute things to, etc.  Their assistant is Audrey 
Robertson.  I lost our most recent phone list but please get one from her 
(x35849).

2.  Usually I get in around 8:30 and leave around 6.  I'm not picky about 
when you're in the office; it is very rare that I will need you to come in 
early or stay late.  I think I asked Janet only twice.

3.  Major projects I'm working on right now that you'll hear me mention a lot:

- TW Options (a tariff filing)
- Order 637 compliance
- Caithness/Big Sandy (potential pipeline interconnect)

4.  Standing meetings:

- TW Commercial Group staff meeting:  Monday at 9:30
- Omaha regulatory staff meeting:  Tues. at 8:15.
- Therapist:  every few weeks Thurs. 9:00 (if anyone asks, I'm in a meeting; 
but if they knew where I really was I'm sure they would understand!)

5.  Faxes:  I get faxes from Regulatory a lot and they generally don't call 
first.  Please check the fax machine once a day (and my chair, if I'm not on 
47 that day, in case someone got a fax for me and put it there).

6.  Mail:  Please open my mail, and I'll try to come pick it up every day.

7.  Filing:  I generally avoid keeping files of useless information.  
However, since I'm a regulatory lawyer it is inevitable that I will have a 
ton of paper to stash away where I can find it later.  Filing is pretty 
important to me.  I promise to try to let you know what files are more 
important than others so you can prioritize.  The good news:  I rarely ever 
go to the extent where I would have you index a file.  Just putting things in 
the right folder is enough.

8.  Computer files:  At the beginning of each quarter, please create a new 
Word file folder (if you look under sscott you'll see I have 2ndqtr00, 
3rdqtr00, etc.)

9.  Calendar:  Please obtain access to my Lotus Organizer, and if you get 
e-mails of meetings I'm supposed to attend go ahead and put them in the 
calendar. 

10.  Friends you're likely to hear from a lot:  Ann, Bill, my grandmother 
("Ms. Savoy"), Dianna

11.  The Other Susan Scott:  There is a Susan M Scott who works for ENA.  I 
get her mail and phone calls all the time!  Her extension is 31445.  Not sure 
of her location as it seems to change a lot.

I look forward very much to working with you!!Not sure of the topic of our meeting but here's the Options filing in case 
you need it.
Here is the draft for distribution.  In addition to the customer-friendly 
"looking forward to meeting with our business partners" language I know 
you'll include, I'd suggest including something like the following:

Attached are drafts of the proposed tariff provisions (including the form of 
Transport Option Amendment) and a filing letter.  We are providing these 
draft documents to you in advance of filing them with FERC as part of a 
good-faith effort to resolve any remaining issues with our shippers prior to 
filing.  The drafts are for purposes of discussion by workshop attendees 
only, and we ask that you not distribute them to persons outside your 
company.  Additionally, while we hope that these drafts are close to being in 
final form, they are of course subject to revision and final management 
approval prior to filing with the Commission.
Attached is the proposed contract with Oneok.  Since it is a maximum rate 
deal, there is no discount letter.  However, I am circulating this for 
approval because it contains a special provision (found in the "Other" 
section) regarding marketing of capacity for release, as allowed by Section 
30.8 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transwestern's tariff.

Christine, you and Michele will need to fill in the address and account

The attached letter agreement reflects my discussion with Drew about the 
marketing fee.  The FTS-1 Agreement will just be a plain vanilla agreement 
(i.e., minus the marketing fee language) and the parties will execute the 
attached instead.  Questions or comments -- let me know.

Subject: Oneok Contract

Attached is the proposed contract with Oneok.  Since it is a maximum rate 
deal, there is no discount letter.  However, I am circulating this for 
approval because it contains a special provision (found in the "Other" 
section) regarding marketing of capacity for release, as allowed by Section 
30.8 of the General Terms and Conditions of Transwestern's tariff.

Christine, you and Michele will need to fill in the address and account 
information.  My sincerest apologies for operating outside the usual 
contracting procedure but since time is even more of the essence that usual 
here, I felt it was best to get a pro forma version of this out for approval 
as soon as possible.

Please e-mail your approval to Christine and me by noon tomorrow if

The Mark Morris group performance is the last weekend of this month, the 27th 
- 29th.  See the website www.spahouston.org and click on "Program Notes" for 
a detailed description.  

Bill and I will leave for Austin tomorrow a.m. as early as we can manage.  
I'm not picky about where we go for dinner, but was thinking Bill might enjoy 
going to the Bitter End brew pub -- I'm sure they don't take reservations but 
it should not be a problem if we go early enough.  

The landscaper removed all the bushes in the front beds and it looks weird!  
Can't wait for her to get the new gravel in my driveway.

We'll call tomorrow a.m. if not sooner!  Have a good day!  I was successful shopping for Jim on-line at B&N and Territory Ahead.  Mum, 
only the book will be shipped to your house; I was on autopilot and typed in 
my work address for the other.  (Really missed the boat on tennis clothes.  
You have to act early.  Today I saw one of the Met pros leaving with his 
catalog to order FALL 2000 Nike stuff!)  Karin, I am probably going to make a 
stop at Macy's or Neiman's makeup counter at some point so I could pick up 
the Estee Lauder for MeeMaw* if you know the shade.  

Bill's b-day is today; if you want to send a message his e-mail is 
75261.151@compuserve.com.

That's all this elf knows.

Transwestern held its Transport Options Workshop on August 31.   Commercial 
and regulatory representatives of BP-Amoco, Burlington, Conoco, Coral, 
Dynegy, Phillips and Reliant attended.  After a brief overview of the 
proposed TW Options filing, we opened the floor for questions and comments.  
Here is a summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  For example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, if ENA 
buys a call option it is essentially a free option.  ENA could buy a call out 
of the money and we could buy it back from them, with the proceeds going to 
Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested that TW's marketing affiliates be banned 
from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to 
credit the call money to other shippers.  BP's concern is that TW's filing 
will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service, so they 
want TW's options program to be as restricted as possible.  Dynegy reiterated 
its suggestion that the marketing affiliate be required to credit back the 
difference between the option fee paid by the affiliate and the next highest 
bidder's bid, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest bid by a 
certain percentage.  

Our response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing 
affiliate would be a concern, we feel that TW is entitled to a presumption 
that it has complied and will continue to comply with the rules on sale of 
capacity to marketing affiliates.  At this point we are not inclined to 
voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others 
have issues regarding Commission marketing affiliate policy in general, those 
issues should be addressed in a different proceeding that pertain to all 
interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  Our response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that options will constitute a 
negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.  We did not 
respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's position at this point 
is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, the deals 
will only be negotiated rate deals if the total rate exceeds the maximum 
rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Several customers expressed concern that the options 
program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not 
clear why they thought that options would create more opportunity for 
hoarding than already exists.  Their perception was that options would simply 
make hoarding cheaper and easier.  We acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although we did not commit to 
placing any limits on the quantity of capacity for which a shipper may 
purchase an option, it is possible that FERC may require us to do so.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California to elicit their 
comments, and finalize the FERC filing by mid-September.

summary of the comments.

Marketing affiliate concerns.  BP's regulatory representative expressed 
concern that TW's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game 
the system.  In BP's example, since TW and ENA are both Enron companies, ENA 
could purchase an "out of the money" call option essentially cost free, since 
its affiliate (TW) would have the ability to buy the option back.  Proceeds 
from ENA's ability to then "move the market" through the establishment of the 
long basis position would go directly to Enron's bottom line.  BP suggested 
that TW's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the 
marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to 
other shippers.  Although BP admits that Transwestern's prior dealings with 
ENA have not been suspect, BP fears that TW's filing will set a precedent for 
other pipelines to offer a similar service.  Since TW will be the first 
pipeline to offer such services, BP wants TW's program to be as restricted as 
possible.  Dynegy echoed BP's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but 
rather than shelve the program entirely, Dynegy reiterated an earlier 
suggestion that Transwestern be required to credit back the difference 
between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if 
the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage.  

TW's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a 
marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable 
record in this area, TW should be entitled to a presumption that it has 
complied and will continue to comply with Commission policy covering the sale 
of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily 
include any limitations on the options program.  If BP and others have 
serious concerns regarding the Commission's overall policy on marketing 
affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that 
applies to all interstate pipelines.

Right of first refusal.  Burlington asked whether options would replace the 
right of first refusal.  TW's  response was that ROFR will still be available 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.

Negotiated rate.  BP's representative claimed that option contracts will 
constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as 
such.  TW did not respond to this or discuss it further.  However, TW's 
position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the 
transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment 
will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the 
option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate.  

Hoarding capacity.  Using the recent large block sale of capacity on El Paso 
as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program 
would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.  It was not clear why 
some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would 
create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.  Perhaps 
because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the 
underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make 
hoarding cheaper and easier.  TW acknowledged that the potential for 
withholding capacity from the market is one reason for FERC's current policy 
against reserving capacity for shippers.  Although TW did not commit to 
placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for 
capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that FERC may require 
TW to do so in a final order.

Our plan is to meet with PG&E and SoCalGas in California the week of 
September 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the FERC 
filing by mid-September.

Robert, in response to your question, I don't know who the El Paso tax 
contact is, but I'll find out & let you know.  Thanks again.


Christine, the "actual fuel usage" provision is probably a material deviation 
from the tariff, unless we cap the fuel rate at the maximum percentage stated 
in our tariff.  I have added language to this effect.

If we're using the "actual fuel" language because we anticipate that the fuel 
usage will exceed the maximum, and therefore we do not wish to cap the 
percentage at the maximum, we can certainly leave my additional language out 
and file a summary of the contract.  I do not think such a filing would 
generate too much unwanted attention from FERC or our shippers.  Let me know.

Subject: Draft Duke discount letter

Let me know if you have any revisions to the provided discount letter.

Note that this contract will only charge ACTUAL FUEL utilized if the Shipper 
transports along the primary path (Paragraph 2).  Also, Kevin - is $.09 a 
sufficient TOTAL RATE for alternate deliveries to the California Border?  I 
think by fixing the rate like this we are leaving a lot of money behind.  We 
could put wording in the contact that each month the alternate rate to 
California will be set by Transwestern.  We have, a long time ago, used this 
language and it forces the shipper to call TK for the appropriate montly rate 
quote.  If fact, Richardson Products has this arrangement.   Let me know your 
thoughts.





Elizabeth, Jeff forwarded me your questions about capacity options.  I've 
answered them to the extent they involve legal/regulatory issues.  If you 
need anything further please don't hesitate to call.

?  Can a new shipper who enters into an FTS-1 contract with zero MDQ in order 
to purchase a shipper call option or sell a transporter put option be 
allowed, prior to the exercise date, to transfer the underlying option rights 
by permanently releasing this contract?    YES.

?   Will we be required to report these contracts with zero MDQ on the Index 
of Customers and/or the Transactional Report?  YES.

? Can the releasing shipper permanently release a portion of his existing MDQ 
and choose to keep or transfer the option rights?   YES.  The shipper could 
even release all of its MDQ (reducing it to zero) and keep its option rights.

? How is it determined whether a contract with an option amendment is within 
the min/max tariff rate or needs to be filed as a negotiated rate?  The 
option fee is converted to a per-Dth, per day rate and added to the transport 
rate.  If the total exceeds the maximum tariff rate, it's "negotiated".  
Otherwise, our position is that it's not negotiated.  We are not 100% 
positive that FERC will agree with us on this issue.How about tomorrow?
I have the new pro forma OBA in Word format, by the way.  Should make getting 
a draft out easier.  Here it is if you want to take a look.

How about discussing this over lunch anytime this week?  Let me know.  Thanks.

I think that ultimately I would feel OK about giving them #1 and #2 under the 
circumstances, if these guys are really that concerned about these issues.  I 
really don't think TW is ever going to breach its confidentiality

Gerald:

Jere Bates asked that I comment on your redline of the confidentiality
agreement that I helped draft.  My comments are as follows:

1. Regarding the strikeout in Section 2 of the language concerning the
obligations of Enron surviving termination, Tri-State is opposed to striking
this.  The information is not to be used at any time other than for the
purpose set forth in the agreement, and the fact that Enron may cease to
acquire new information should not relieve it of its obligation not to use
information it has previously received for unintended purposes. We believe
that language protects against that occurrence-and is consistent with the
language in the last sentence of Section 5 as well.

2. Regarding Section 6, Tri-State is opposed to waiving consequential,
punitive or exemplary damages because in our view, it is likely that many
damages Tri-State would suffer as a result of a breach would not be direct
or ordinary, but rather consequential.  In addition, the right to recover
punitive or exemplary damages is needed in our view to protect against
blatant disregard for the terms of the agreement.  We also believe that we
should have three years to commence an action after termination.

3.  Regarding Section 7(b), we believe Colorado law is appropriate since
Tri-State is the party that would be bringing an action for breach and
should have the benefit of doing so in accordance with the laws it is
familiar with.

Please feel free to call or e-mail me or Jere with a response.  We are open
to discussing these points, but do feel very strongly that our position is
reasonable and appropriate.

Thanks,

Dave Nocera  


Christine, I made a few changes for purposes of clarification.

Subject: Revised Duke Letter

Here it is.



I've discussed the "actual fuel" provision with Christine and Bob and made 
them aware that this is a nonconforming provision that would need to be 
filed, since the FTS-1 rate schedule provides that fuel payments are to be 
made according to the percentages set forth in the rate sheets.  

According to Bob's calculations, the actual fuel used by Duke under this 
contract is likely to exceed the applicable percentages in our tariff.

I don't think FERC or any of our shippers would have any immediate objection 
to our charging actual fuel.  However, I know that fuel is a sensitive issue 
on TW so I wanted to be sure to draw your attention to this provision.  Let 
me know what you think.

Duke which outlines the conditions of Transwestern's Contribution in Aid of 
Construction (CIAC) payment to Duke for certain facility upgrades.

Transwestern shall pay Duke $750,000 for Duke facility upgrades in order to 
increase gas receipts into Transwestern from Duke's Artesia plant and Big 
Eddy gathering system by an incremental 20,000 Dth/d.  Duke shall 
subsequently subscribe to a five year transportation contract for 20,000 
Dth/d of East of Thoreau  (EOT) capacity at a $.05/Dth/d one-part rate 
effective November 1, 2000.  Duke shall be charged ACTUAL fuel, currently 
calculated as 1.5% (compared to EOT Tariff fuel rate of 1.31%), for any 
transportation within Transwestern's EOT Area.  Duke has also been granted 
the ability to flow to California on an alternate basis at a total rate of 
$.09/Dth/d plus applicable Tariff fuel (currently 5%).

Please indicate approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  Please contact me at x5702

Thanks Robert, this is a big help.
Just wondering -- you make the statement that "El Paso is not directing TW to 
build the interconnect facilities..."  Do you think that our having an 
interconnect agreement outlining the specifications for the facilities and 
setting forth certain indemnities weaken our position at all in terms of 
saying this is not a CIAC?

Subject: Re: CIAC  

I can only address this from the tax position.  Books may differ from the 
noted treatment depending on the true facts.  I have a call to James Centilli 
for his thoughts.  I also have not reviewed any written language, so this is 
based on our conversations; therefore the facts may change depending on the 
final arrangement.

Based on my understanding, the meter fee will be structured as a fee paid to 
TW for services and not to build the interconnect facilities.  Because El 
Paso is not directing TW to build the interconnect facilities TW will not 
record these fees as a CIAC for tax.  In short, the management fee is just 
normal operational type revenue.  The benefit to El Paso is that they avoid 
the gross-up because this payment does not fall under the guidelines of IRS 
Code Section 118 (b).  However, please note that the management fee is still 
taxable to TW in the year actually received or deemed received.   It is just 
not classified as a CIAC for tax purposes.  

The potential book benefit to TW is that the interconnect facilities built 
should be allowed as part of rate base because the assets were built by TW 
and not contributed from El Paso -- I have a call to James Centilli to 
confirm.

Clarification on CIAC ( IRC 118(b)).  This is a code section that governs for 
tax only how payments received from customers or potential customers for 
services that benefit the customer are treated for tax purposes.  For tax,  
the money received is recognized in the year received or deemed received, and 
the asset is depreciated, normally 15 years, MACRS.  The Gross-up paid is the 
time value of money over the life of the asset and is paid by the customer 
requesting the service.  

The Management fee structure will generate the same result as the CIAC for 
tax.  For tax, the money is received and taxed.  The money is then used 
indirectly to build the interconnect facilities that are deprecated over 15 
years, MACRS for tax.  The piece missing is that El Paso avoids the gross-up 
of approximately $50,000.  The $50,000 becomes a lost cost to TW for doing 
the deal with El Paso.  The lost cost should be off-set in part from rate 
recovery.  I don't know how this piece will work -- James Centilli should be 
able to confirm.

Let me know if we need to discuss further.  I am out of the office after 
12:30 today to return on Monday.  I will check my voice mail.  However, If 
you need to move on this or need additional help,  please call me on my 
mobile number (832) 647-4610.

Subject: CIAC

Robert, here is the beginning of a note I need to send to Drew Fossum 
explaining what we're doing with El Paso.  Can you elaborate on the "meter 
fee" approach?  

I'm not sure I really understand what keeps it from being a CIAC, and why we 
get to include it in the rate base.  

If you can add to this I would appreciate it, or just give me a call and we 
can discuss it further.  Thanks so much for your help.

***

El Paso Field Services wants TW to build interconnect facilities.  Estimated 
cost:  $280,000.  EPFS will contribute $165,000 pursuant to an interconnect 
agreement.  The Commercial Group would like to avoid the tax gross-up 
associated with a contribution in aid of construction.  The Internal Revenue 
Code expressly provides that contributions in aid of construction and other 
contributions made by a customer or potential customer (collectively, 
"CIACs") are not contributions to capital and thus are not excluded from 
gross income.  Accordingly, such amounts are required to be included in gross 
income.  

EPFS has proposed, instead of the $165,000 being paid in a lump sum, that the 
contribution instead be paid in equal monthly installments as a "meter fee."  
Our tax department has advised me that while this approach does not absolve 
TW from tax liability on that revenue, it does have a couple of advantages.  
It would remove the contribution from the CIAC category (why is it not a 
CIAC?)and TW would be allowed to include it in its rate base.  Additionally, 
TW would be allowed to treat the interconnect facilities as a depreciable 
asset.  




Lorraine, here is the new language for the discount letter.  You might want 
to compare the other language in the agreement to that of the existing one to 
make sure I got the right version (or I'll do it on Monday).  Let me know if 
you have questions.  I just ran it by Drew and he is OK with it.

Hi Mum!  What an eventful few days it has been.  Sorry I didn't call over the 
weekend.  I had my hands full painting my bedroom!  It took forever!  Luckily 
I got the color right on the first try:  the Happy Yellow looks pretty good.  
Saturday I hauled my paint-covered self to the Met for a pro-am tennis 
tournament, which was fun.  It was a benefit for DiverseWorks, the 
theater/art group I've been interested in joining.  In fact, yesterday I got 
a call from their executive director asking if I was still interested in 
board membership, and that they would be voting on me tonight!  I'm really 
excited and am expecting good news.  This could be an auspicious start to 
life after law for me!
Sure enjoyed my visit to Austin.  It went by too quickly!  I hope you're 
having a good week; let me hear from you!
Love,
Sooz.Ashley, the oven/stove problem should be fixed before the weekend.  If you 
have any further problems with it please let me know; I realize it's pretty 
old.  I never noticed the control for the oven doesn't even have temperatures 
marked on it...the repairman is definitely taking care of that too!  The 
handy dudes are coming over to give me an estimate on the kitchen and 
bathroom floors and I'm going to also ask them to replace the wood around the 
A/C in the second bedroom.  If there's anything else you've noticed that 
needs fixing let me know.Ashley, all that is fine, and I certainly understand, though I would very 
much hate to lose you because you are a fabulous renter.  Keep your freedom!  
Stay in my apartment!!  If you do not want to renew for 6 months and want to 
go month to month after Nov., that is fine.  All I ask is 30 days notice 
before you move out.  In any event, I'll probably get the floors done just 
because I think it would be a good improvement to make regardless...I'll 
check with you before I get the work done to make sure the timing is OK with 
you.

Susan,

Before you spend too much making improvements (though the oven does need to be
fixed!)

Right now, it looks like Deron is not going to be moving in with me as he has
some concerns about the wiring for all of his computer gadgets.

I love my (your!) garage apartment and really do not want to give it up, 
however
I am not sure if it makes sense for us to keep paying 2 rents, so I am not 
100%
sure whether I will be renewing my lease after November.  If I did, it would
probably be for another six months (ie, I would delay moving in together, 
which
I am considering as there is no real reason to rush).

If I do not, I would be happy to post an ad for it here at Hewitt as I have
nothing but nice things to say about it and you!  Plus, one would be very
hard-pressed to find an irresponsible person here- there are lots of wonderful
people here.   I will try to make a decision by the end of Sept. as to give 
you
notice and enough time to try to help you find a nice tenant!

I am sorry to seem to fickle-  life is suddenly getting very complicated!

Just so you know, I spoke with the group this morning about contracting

Thanks for your attention to this last week.Hi Misty!  How's everything?  Are we on for this weekend?  Let me know.  
Since I have plans to see Lyle Lovett on Fri. night, I was thinking of flying 
in rather than driving Sat. a.m. to save on time & energy, especially since 
you live so close to the airport!

Painted my bedroom Happy Yellow while listening to the U.S. Open weekend 
before last...drank a lot of beer also.  Am amazed it turned out as well as 
it did.

You said you work with someone named Hamlet, right?  Apparently he used to 
live across the street from Karin and Jim, on Evans!  I didn't think there 
could possibly be 2 Hamlets.  Small world.

Subject: Summary of Protestors to TW's filing

Attached is summary of protestor comments to TW's Order 637 compliance 
filing.  It will be attached to the Weekly Report as well.


Lindy, FERC has consistently held that pipelines may make "operational" sales 
of gas.  Specifically this has included occasional sales of gas resulting 
from cashout requirements and the buying and selling of gas to maintain 
linepack levels.  TW's sale of excess linepack gas would probably be fine.  
By contrast, buying gas then turning around and reselling it would be suspect 
as it would look too much like our unbundled merchant function.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Subject: TW Buy/Sell Gas For Operations

In our Plan meeting, we were discussing UAF and Operation's objective to 
reduce it.  Operation's objective is a volumetric goal, but we are at risk 
for the gas price.  It started me thinking about our whole fuel expense.  
TW's fuel expense is valued on our books at the TW systemwide index.  Should 
TW be hedging the fuel that we burn?  Jan-Aug, 2000 (acctg months) Y-T-D fuel 
expense is at $21MM ($2.6MM/month) at a total volume of 6.7 Bcf.  This 
summer, with high gas prices and Gallup in service, our fuel has been ranging 
$3.4-3.8MM a month.  Operations has objectives to minimize the fuel use, but 
not the price.
  
How could we hedge our fuel used?  Would we sell all the fuel retained (hedge 
it as high as possible) and manage our fuel expense separately through its 
own purchasing and hedging (as low as possible) effort?  Could we have hedged 
some portion of our fuel usage last year for this year at $2.36 (like we 
hedged our excess fuel) and not be subject to the high prices we're seeing 
this summer?

Do you think there is an opportunity here to manage our fuel expense more 
effectively?

Susan,
I think you had looked at TW's ability to buy/sell gas a few months back 
(when we were looking at fuel monetization).  What did the FERC Order say 
about under what circumstances TW could buy/sell gas?

You had a question about the meaning of Section 4.3.  Here's a brief 
explanation.

Section 4.2 covers indemnification in case one party gets sued by a third 
party for damage caused by negligence of the other party.  I'm OK with 
eliminating "stockholders" and the "...judgments of any nature..." clause you 
two spoke about on the phone as long as they come out of both subparagraphs 
a. and b.

Section 4.3 needs to stay in because it covers any potential action by EPFS 
against TW for damage to EPFS's facilities during the term of the agreement.  
TW is already obligated elsewhere in the agreement to construct and operate 
the facilities in accordance with industry practice, tariff and DOT 
standards.  Our policy in interconnect agreements is that if TW complies with 
these standards we should not then somehow be liable for damage to EPFS in 
case of explosion, etc.  In other words, both parties bear the risk attached 
to something unforeseeable going wrong notwithstanding use of industry and 
DOT standards.
(By the way, I believe the "notwithstanding anything in this Article 4 to the 
contrary" language should come out; I'm not sure why it's in the draft.)

Any questions -- please e-mail or call (713-853-0596).Nancy, I've prepared the attached outline in response to FERC Staff's request 
that we provide "something in writing."  This is basically just a description 
of our proposal.  I've tried to keep it brief so that staff members are not 
reading while we're trying to talk to them.  It should be enough information 
to raise a lot of questions.

Please wait until Shelley or I give you the go-ahead to pass this along to 
the relevant Commission people; I'd like to give the other addressees the 
opportunity to comment on this to the extent possible.  

Everyone else:  please give me your comments ASAP as Nancy has been asked to 
provide something to them tomorrow.

Hi, Sooz!

Guess you didn't have to make your trip.

Had thought that seeing Carmen in Houston even though it's being presented
here in May would be interesting, but think I'll pass on it.  I return Oct 18
and don't know if Karin wants me to spend the weekend with her and the Bug or
not since Jim will be gone.  But, I might come the end of Oct to do some
shopping.  Eric will be coming sometime the first 2 wks of Nov to use his
free ticket by the 15th.  We're going to get his reservation made when he
picks me up at the San Jose airport.  I'll be coming at some point for Ann
Kelly's birthday which is in Nov.  It's always difficult to find a date with
everyone's busy schedule--especially Ann's.  She never stops.

Went to the outlet this morning and bought some shoes but couldn't find
anything else.  That's always a lost cause for me and it will be a long time
before I go again.

Gorgeous day here, but it's warming up again.  So pleasant sleeping with the
bedroom door open to the porch.

Looking forward to seeing you.  Love, mum

Drew, here's my first stab at a rehearing argument.  I did not go as far as I 
could have because I really think we should argue that there should be no 
limitation at all and that TW should be able to decide for itself what 
capacity it can sell as firm.  Instead, I've proposed a solution that will be 
less controversial, as we discussed earlier this week.  If you think this 
passes the laugh test I can do some rewriting and circulate it.  

My biggest concern is portraying PNM's capacity as "firm" or "interruptible" 
since PNM does not use that terminology, in its tariff or otherwise, except 
to assure us over the phone that it is firm!  I'd like to check to see if PNM 
is comfortable with all this before we file anything.  

Call when you can; this is not due 'til Oct. 15.
Ted, I made a slight change on the first page.  Also, the blanks of course 
need to be filled in for $$ amount and term.
Do we have other guaranties in favor of both TW and NNG?  I know we probably 
do, and I may have even approved them.  But if possible I'd prefer to have 
two separate guaranties since TW and NNG are separate legal entities.  It is 
not a huge concern, since we are not jointly obligating the two companies to 
do anything.  If it would cause an administrative hassle to have two 
agreements, let me know.

Mary Kay -- please see the attached -- Red Cedar has essentially asked us for 
acknowledgement that TW is willing to allow them to act as agent to transport 
gas for producers even though Red Cedar itself does not have title to the 
gas.  Drew has seen this and says he is going to discuss it with you.  
Jim, if we delete current Section 4.3, then we would like to reinsert the 
"negligence" clauses in Section 4.2 (I don't remember how they got negotiated 
out in the first place).  So it would read:

4.2  a.  TW shall release, protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless EPFS, 
its affiliated companies and officers, directors, employees, and agents and 
servants, contractors and subcontractors ("Indemnified Party" or "Indemnified 
Parties") from and against that portion of the liabilities, losses, claims, 
damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal 
injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorneys' fees 
and expenses) caused or contributed to by the negligence of TW or its 
agent(s) arising out of or in connection with its obligations under the terms 
of this Agreement.

b.  EPFS shall release, protect, indemnify, defend and hold harmless TW and 
its Indemnified Parties from and against that portion of the liabilities, 
losses, claims, damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits 
for personal injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable 
attorneys' fees and expenses) caused or contributed to by the negligence of

  b.   EPFS shall release, protect, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TW

damages, penalties, causes of action, suits (including suits for personal
injuries or death or property damage and including reasonable attorney's

Agreement.

Section 4.3
In no event shall either party be responsible for the gross negligence or
wilfull misconduct of the other party or their Indemnified Parties.

at points where none is available and 3) directing El Paso to schedule 
capacity acquired during an open season (effective Jan. 1, 2000) into 
SoCal/Topock on a secondary basis only.  SoCal states that it has experienced 
daily cuts of up to 57% and averaging 25%.

Subject: UAF Presentation

For the past two months I have been visiting the GPG Operations Regional 
offices giving a presentation on physical "UAF Fundamentals and Issues" .

The presentation has been very well received.  Interest is high, and numerous 
questions have been raised at each meeting.  The presentation can be given in 
50 minutes if questions are limited.  It has taken up to 3 hours due to the 
amount of questions from the attendees. 

One  focus of these meetings is to give the field staff a better 
understanding of the impact  UAF has on our bottom line (TW) and  the impact 
it has on our shipper costs (NNG). 

Yesterday, 10/4/00 I had the opportunity to meet with several members of the 
financial group in Houston to discuss UAF.  Coming out of that meeting was a 
request to schedule a Houston presentation on "UAF Fundamentals".  This has 
been done, and will be at 1 PM on Oct. 18, 2000. (Place yet to be determined.)

Two Questions:

Is there any interest in having me give the presentation in Omaha?????
Do you have any staff in Houston that you would like  to invite to the 10/18 
presentation????


Copy of the presentation if you are interested:     

Thanks  Steve  37885

Susan,

I would like to request 1 final change to the interconnect agreement before
execution.  It is a simple change to better clarify the intent of paragraph
3.4

This is how I would like to see it read,

3.4 For a period of two (2) years from the date of the Facilities are
completed and placed in-service, EPFS shall be obligated to
 deliver an average of  12,500 MMBtu/d to TW at the Interconnect
Point.  At the completion of the second year from the date
 the facilities are completed and placed in service, If EPFS has not
met the 9.1 Bcf volume  commitment, EPFS will refund
 $100,000 to TW within thirty (30) days.  At any time during the two
(2) year period should EPFS's cumulative delivery to TW
 at the Inteconnect Point meet or exceed the 9.1 Bcf commitment, EPFS
is relieved  of its volumetric and monetary obligation
 to TW as described in this paragragh 3.4.  .......  rest as
originally writen...


Please let me know what you think.

The attached draft reflects revisions made pursuant to our discussions with 
FERC staff.  You will be receiving a hard copy of the tariff sheets 
separately.

Please make sure you read the "Waivers" section towards the end of the 
document as it contains some additional requests for waivers.

Also, there seems to be some confusion over whether we are going to post all 
options, not just Shipper call options.  My previous drafts have provided for 
posting of Shipper call options only.  All other types of options will be 
generally available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, through our tariff.  My 
thinking was that it is commercially impracticable to post the specifics of 
all types of options, and it's not necessary since options will be noted on 
our transaction reports required by Order 637.  Let me know what you think.

Let me know your comments as soon as possible.  I understand that the 
Commercial Group told Stan Horton this would be filed this week and Shelley 
reported at staff meeting on Monday that it would be filed this week or next 
week.  As soon as I get everyone's comments we can get this finalized.

Thank you.

Mark, Jeff Fawcett asked me to forward the attached documents to you.  One is 
an interconnect agreement and one is an operating agreement.  I would 
describe both as "examples" rather than "forms," since every deal is

Jay and Dan:

This is the first draft of a filing Transwestern is considering filing with
FERC on Monday, October 16, 2000.  Susan Scott will be finalizing this
document on Friday, October 13, 2000.  I will be out of town and unavailable
to review it so she asked if you would look it over here (and as revised on
Friday) to be sure they do not say anything in the filing that is not true
or mischaracterized.  If you have any other suggestions, Susan's phone
number is below.  Again, they are still considering whether or not they will
make this filing.


Susan:

I understand that Jay Golub, too, is traveling this week but is able to view
and respond to his email.  His email address is jgolub@bakerbotts.com
<mailto:jgolub@bakerbotts.com> .  I am also forwarding this to Dan McFearin,
Manager of Transportation Services.  Dan's email address is dmcfear@pnm.com
<mailto:dmcfear@pnm.com>  and Dan's phone number is (505) 241-2496.  If you
do not hear from Jay, you can check with Dan.

I have made changes to the document.  I think the document refers to "peak"
period when it means to refer to "non-peak" period in the first paragraph of
the Argument and vice versa in the second paragraph.  You may have caught
these by now.  I will be in on Monday after all so if you need to talk to
me, you can call me on Monday.

Thanks,
Barbara Whittaker

That is pretty much all we needed for now Susan.  I appreciate your offer of

You mentioned you sent comments to someone at AA.  I assume you mean the

Subject: 1999 Form No. 2 Review - Legal

Maria/Susan,

My name is Tony Jackson with Arthur Andersen, and I am the experienced staff 
on the Enron Transportation Services (with a focus on NNG and TW) audit 
team.  Right now, we are in the midst of several internal control reviews 
related to various risk areas. 

We are currently testing the risk that NNG and TW reserves (regulatory, legal 
contingencies, etc.) are inappropriately valued and/or established.  One of 
the controls that Accounting cited to mitigate this risk was that both Legal 
and Rates reviewed the NNG and TW FERC Form No. 2s prior to issuance.  Harry 
Walters and Allen Joe mentioned to us that there is no formal "sign-off" or 
approval process by Legal and Rates of the Form 2s, but instead, drafts were 
sent to the groups and any comments were then reviewed with Accounting.  Your 
names were mentioned as those they sent the 1999 Form 2 drafts to for Legal 
to review (Maria-NNG and Susan-TW).   

In order for us to test this control, we need to confirm with your group that 
this type of review was performed for the 1999 NNG and TW Form No. 2s.  What 
role did you and your group play in this review?

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks for your time.

Tony - AA

Southern Trails proposed, at an estimated cost of $155,000,000, a pipeline 
project consisting mostly of 693 miles of crude oil pipeline acquired from 
ARCO.  Ten percent of the project would be new construction and the remainder 
would be conversion of the crude oil line to gas service.  The pipeline 
system would be divided into an East Zone and a West Zone.  The East Zone, 
which will begin in the San Juan Basin and end at the California border, will 
have 87,500 Dth/d of available capacity.  The West Zone, wholly within 
California, will have 120,000 Dth/d.  

Southern Trails received certificate authority for the project on July 
28,2000.  An optional certificate application does not require any showing of 
market need; however, Southern Trails did hold an open season from Sept. to 
Oct. 1998 during which it received 22 bids totalling 810,000 Dth/d of 
demand.  The order issuing the certificate did not say how much of the 
capacity had been subscribed, only that Southern Trails had contracted with 
its affiliate, Questar Energy, for 30,000 Dth/d of firm capacity in theh East 
Zone for 5 years and one month, and taht firm transportation service 
agreements of 5 and 10 year terms are "being negotiated" with prospective 
shippers which, if executed, would subscribe the balance of the capacity in 
both the East and West zones.  

TW is an intervenor in this docket so I have received everything that has 
been filed.  I have no further information about any further subscription of 
capacity.  I also have no information regarding any progress that has been 
made on construction.
If you need a more detailed summary of the proposal that was filed at FERC, 
or if you have any other questions, please let me know and I'll see what I 
can find.  I've got the entire environmental report in my office if we need 
that for any reason!Chad -- Good to see you the other day.  Please give me a call when you return 
to your office.  I am embarrassed to say that I am not sure I have the right 
version of the Operating Agreement we sent you in March...if we can compare 
notes, I can make sure I get the correct one to you without further delay.

Thank you!

Colleen, thank you so much for your very prompt attention to this.  I 
definitely had the wrong version of the agreement.
Jeff confirmed by voice mail this morning that even though we already 
included the 5.4 language in the draft we sent him back in March, he does 
find it objectionable and will want to modify it, so he will be very 
interested in seeing your suggested language too.

Please send your attachment "CalpineO&M 10-18-00 edits to draft03-20-00".

Again, thank you so much for your help with this.  (Calpine has finally woken 
up and realized they want this in place Nov. 1...)
I will let you know how negotiations are shaping up.

Subject: Draft- Operating Agreement

Attached below is Jeff Fawsett's  3/22/00 note to Calpine with TW's 3/20/00 
draft of the Operating Agreement .  What changes if any did Calpine require 
to this draft?  Please note that Section 5.4 of the attached 3/20/00 draft is 
substantively identical to my further-revised Section 5.4 (with subsections A 
and B) that I forwarded to you a few days after Jeff's note to Calpine.

 From our meeting this morning I understand that Jeff appears adverse to 
Transwestern's claiming zero financial responsibility for damages to 
Calpine's Measurement and Control Facilities that result from TW's O&M 
Services.  Consequently, I made some modifications to Articles 4 and 5 of the 
3/20/00 draft for TW management's consideration.  These changes are noted in 
the attached document marked "CalpineO&M 10-18-00 edits to draft03-20-00".  
With my 10-18-00 revisions, TW places a limit on its liability to Calpine for 
loss or damage incurred by Calpine due to TW's Services, including loss or 
damage to the existing M&C Facilities,  if and to the extent damage is caused 
by TW's negligent acts or omissions.  To complete my modification to Section 
5.3, TW is to insert the maximum aggregate amount of financial liability it 
is willing to assume in any contract year.  This amount could be the amount 
of Calpine's deductible on its property insurance coverage or a lesser 
amount.  Whatever the amount chosen, please remember that TW is self-insured 
for the first $2M, each occurrence.  Therefore, what is the amount of risk 
that TW is willing to pay out of its earnings if Calpine claims damage to its 
existing Facility due to TW's negligent operations?  That is the amount to 
insert in the blank space in Section 5.3.  

FYI, the changes in Sections 3.1 and 4.1 (b) and (c), and the striking of 
Section 4.1 (d) do not create any substantive changes to the 3/20/00 draft.  
I  made the latter changes for stylistic reasons and to correct typos and 
redundancies.  Please call me if you have any questions and to let me know 
the status of this document.  I have lost track of my notes on the status of 
TW Operations' review and approval of the list of Services included in 
Exhibit B; this needs to be determined by Jeff (or his designee) before the 
final definitive agreement is prepared for signing.

Subject: Draft- Operating Agreement

Chad,
Sorry it took so long to get back with you, but we've had some folks out 
(including me) on Spring Break with their kids.  Attached is a draft of the 
Operating Agreement covering TW's operation of the metering station.  It's 
pretty much a standard form agreement for TW, with the possible exception of 
the exhibit defining the operating parameters of the South Point plant.  As I 
mentioned to you in our meeting in Pleasanton, the operating parameters 
exhibit is a useful tool for both companies to assist in identifing some of 
the operating conditions the plant might encounter and the ability of TW to 
load follow those conditions.  I made a number of assumptions regarding the 
burn rates for your facilities, especially the base rate and minimum rates.  
You'll likely have to fine tune those numbers.   Also, I've yet to ask our 
engineers to secure the documentation necessary to complete Exhibit "A" from 
your 3rd party engineers.  We'll include it in the final version.  Please 
give me a call after you and your team has had a chance to review.  Thanks.

Susan:  I would appreciate it if you would at least treat me civilly (such 
as, acknowledge my existence) when we encounter eachother in public, like at 
the Met for example.  I ask you to remember that I did not start this 
situation, but I was forced to deal with it.  I just responded to the 
unprovoked things that you did and said to me -- the likes of which I had 
never before experienced.  Pls keep that in mind.

It has been quite some time since you said you were going to return those 
items I brought you from Hong Kong.  I previously told you that I felt it was 
the right thing to do under the circumstances.  Given what has happened and 
what those items represent, I do not see how you could now feel it is 
appropriate to keep them or how you could possibly derive any enjoyment from 
them.  Pls let me know what you intend to do, and we can make appropriate 
arrangements.  Thanks.

Let me know what you think.
Here's the letter with some slight changes.  
Drew and I thought it better to mention the interconnect for regulatory 
reasons.  Questions? let's chat.
Thanks.
Lorraine -- answers to some of your questions.

Questar Line 90 Company purchased the facilities from ARCO for a total of $38 
million.  At the time it made its FERC application, Questar Southern Trails' 
estimated cost of 1) purchasing the facilities from Line 90 Company and 2) 
converting the line to gas service via the construction of compressor 
stations and various pipeline replacements, realignments and extension:  155 
million.  I assume you want more detail so I'll have Mike Vannorden get the 
relevant exhibits.  

Southern Trails proposed to install 7 new compressor stations.  These are 
detailed on Table 1 in their application cover letter (on my desk if you want 
to take a look).  The various pipeline modifications they proposed to make 
are described in some detail on pages 12 - 16.

Available capacity:  120,000 Dth/day in West Zone; 87,500 in East Zone.

I will have Mike send you exhibits I believe might be of interest.Mike, as we discussed yesterday, please get a copy of the following exhibits 
to the "Happy Trails" application in Docket No. CP99-163-000:

Exhibit K - Cost of facilities

Exhibit N - Revenues, expenses, income

Exhibit O - Depreciation and depletion

Please send them directly to Lorraine Lindberg at EB4150G.  If you have any 
questions she can be reached at 713-853-5403.  Or -- I'll be here the rest of 
the day today.

Thank you!Denise -- can you order this for me?
Let me know if you need any info.
I'll need the laptop plus 2 docking stations, one upstairs and one down.
And a normal monitor & keyboard.

Susan,

I've spoke to our purchasing person, Karon O'gorman, about an order status in 
Omaha.  According to Karon, all purchasing from Omaha and Houston goes 
through her.  Therefore, if you need to order a new laptop, Karon can handle 
all of the arrangements for you.

Thanks,

Sugarbooger,

Looks like Continental is our best bet at $620 per ticket, which I'm assuming 
reflects the beginning of the official high season in C.R.  American is 
slightly lower but you have to go THRU MIAMI!  Ick!
There is a 9:30 a.m. out of Houston on 12/9 and the return trip from San Jose 
is at 8:10 a.m. (a 3 p.m. was also available).
They're holding the tickets for us; if we want them, we have to decide before 
COB tomorrow.

Muchos besos!

you have comments.
I'll have a final draft out shortly.

 Prior to the deadline for filing interventions, Transwestern received a 
request from Commission staff for clarification of the criteria for awarding 
of Shipper call options.  The procedure will be as follows:  an advance 
posting will specify the term of the available option, term of transportation 
service, transportation volume, and instructions for bidding.  Shipper call 
options will be awarded based upon the highest rate payable for the option 
component.  Here is what I think is a final draft...I'm going to give it one last read

Hello Dave.
 
My understanding is that FERC does not yet require electronic contracting, 
but that many pipelines do offer it voluntarily.

Hi,...did I guess correctly as to your e-mail addresses?  If so, I have a
question....

Do you happen to know if there are FERC rules requiring interstate pipelines
(are you familiar with any?) to offer e-contracting (including e-signature)
to customers/shippers, or is it a discretionary service...... or not a
service at all?

Of course, I need to do my own legal research, but maybe you two know off
the top of your head.

Thanks, and cheers...

Here it is.


Today the Commission issued a tolling order on our request for rehearing in 
the PNM capacity docket.  As you recall, we asked for rehearing of the 
Commission's requirement that TW's acquisition of capacity be limited to the 
summer months.  The tolling order is simply FERC's way of buying time to 
consider our request.  In the absence of Commission action within 30 days of 
our rehearing request, our request would have been deemed denied...so we're 
doing well so far.   There is no deadline for the Commission to act on our 
request.  I'll watch to see whether it appears on the Commission's agenda.---------------------- Forwarded by Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron on 11/10/2000

Ted, here are a few suggested changes.
Also, regarding the language you crossed out at the bottom of paragraph 1 
(about notice of default, payment within 15 days, etc.), I do not think that 
language was objectionable from a legal standpoint, and might actually be 
helpful as far as giving them a payment deadline.  However, if it's 
inconsistent with your procedures, or you just don't like having to give them 
notice, I see no problem at all with crossing it out.

Glen, as we discussed, here is the negotiated rate TW deal which TK did today 
under Rate Schedule ITS-1.
The term is ONE DAY, Nov. 15. 
Quantity:  30,000 Dth/day

I know this is a bit unusual.  We are just going to have to ask the FERC for 
a waiver of their "before gas flows" filing requirement.
Given the price spreads and the shippers' willingness to pay more than max. 
rates for short-term deals, we might have more deals like this.  We probably 
need to put our heads together to come up with a better procedure for when 
this happens.  It would be so much better if we were able to send tariff 
sheets via e-mail to our D.C. office.

Mary, I finally was able to locate my copy of the Alternative Rates Policy 
Statement and found the following language:

"A pipeline may file the numbered tariff sheet implementing the negotiated 
rate at the time it intends the rate to
   go into effect. The Commission does not intend to suspend the 
effectiveness of negotiated rate filings or
   impose a refund obligation for those rates. For these reasons, the 
Commission will readily grant requests to
   waive the 30 day notice requirement."

I think it might be fair to interpret the first sentence such that it's OK to 
file on the same day.  This reinforces my belief that 
our waiver language is fine as is.I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation 
with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely 
declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to 
conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me 
like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded 
interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at 
FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very 
leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their 
identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned 
that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney 
will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad.  
Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from 
Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder 
Morgan lawyers.Ted -- see minor changes on the attached.
Try to get them to agree to Texas law.  (Might help to point out that our 
interconnect agreement with Calpine as well as any transport agreement will 
be governed by Texas law.)

On November 2, 2000, the California PUC issued an Order Instituting 
Investigation into the adequacy of Sempra's, SoCal's and SDG&E's planning of 
SoCal's and SDG&E's gas transmission system and what measures should be taken 
to correct any deficiencies.  The parties have been ordered to appear and 
show cause at a hearing (to be scheduled by the assigned ALJ) demonstrating 
that:

 - SDG&E has adequate gas and transmission supply for the 2000/2001 winter 
heating season, as well as the longer term throughout the year.  If such 
supply is not adequate, SDG&E shall submit plans for obtaining an adequate 
supply.

 - SDG&E's gas and transmission supply is adequate to meet anticipated need 
for gas-fired electric generation.  If not, SDG&E shall submit plans for 
obtaining adequate supply.

 - SDG&E's  gas transmission service is not being adversely affected by 
interests of its corporate affiliates.

 - Recently added demands on SDG&E's capacity are not negatively impacting 
supply for SDG&E's customers, and are otherwise consistent with 
representations to the Commission.

 - SDG&E's current gas curtailment rules are just and reasonable; if not, 
SDG&E shall propose changes.

 A written response from the three parties on these issues is due on November 
22.  Other parties may file comments on the response within 10 days after the 
response is filed.

 The Commission also ordered SDG&E to evaluate whether an interim, 
interruptible program, which will provide cost incentives to those customers 
voluntarily electing interruptible service, is needed this winter.  If so, 
SDG&E must submit a proposal for expedited Commission consideration.

 The OII represents the Commission's response to an Advice Letter filed by 
SDG&E requesting emergency review and approval of its proposal to temporarily 
revise the gas transportation service level elections of its large electric 
generation customers.  The Advice Letter was heavily protested and was 
withdrawn by SDG&E.

 In my conversation with Mark Baldwin regarding our pending consulting 
agreement for monitoring California regulatory matters for Transwestern, I 
asked him to watch for Sempra's Nov. 22 filing and to advise whether he 
believes Transwestern should file comments or appear at the hearing that is 
to be scheduled.  I will follow up with Mark, and provide you with a copy of 
the filing.

From astrology.com (must I beware of overindulgence in such websites?)
I like the part about charm and charisma and think it is very true.

Sagittarius and Sagittarius
When two Sagittarians join together in a love match, the truth-loving natures 
makes theirs a near perfect relationship. This couple views the world around 
them with an educated eye and both share an intense hunger for more 
knowledge. They will engage one another in pleasant conversation and 
banter that challenges and tickles the mind.  An occasional hotheaded dispute 
can erupt in the Sagittarius-Sagittarius relationship, when one fact-fanatic 
Sag 
partner carries things a little too far. Easygoing and independent, these two 
are 
compatible when it comes to balancing personal interests. They've never known 
jealousy, and each partner keeps busy with personal projects when not with 
their 
lover. When they are together, however, they do all they can toward pleasing 
their partner and satiating common interests.  Although they are adaptable 
and 
modern, they can, at times, fly off the handle. However, it is not in the 
Archer's 
nature to hold a grudge or let disagreements fester very long. 

Sagittarius is ruled by the Planet Jupiter (Luck). Expansion is the key word 
here; 
as both partners enjoy the acquisition of knowledge, they will carry over 
exciting 
ideas into their relationship. They must be mindful of over-indulgences, as 
such 
gluttony will only distract them. Their charm and charisma make them a very 
pleasant couple not only to one another, but the entire crowd. First of all, this is a brand-new contract, not a modification of one that 
used to be IT.
It's for LFT space that we have posted according to our usual procedure.  A 
receipt point has now been specified:  Bloomfield Compressor.  Our tariff 
allows us to cancel LFT up to 10 days a month, but it also provides that the 
parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer, so Sempra negotiated 
us down to only one day.  TK worked with Darrell Schoolcraft on this and they 
determined this would be acceptable from an operational standpoint.  
Scheduling will happen pursuant to the LFT priority set forth in our tariff.
I left a message for you just now; call when you have a minute.

We really do need to understand the scheduling of this,  if alternates 
haven't been scheduled, IT are and now an LFT---  seems a little

About three weeks ago, I inquired about EBA's  interest in organizing a

?
Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that  EBA was not 
interested.??It would help us a lot in our future planning  if you could 
perhaps help me with your reasoning.??Did we approach you  too late?(given 
the Dec 4 deadline)??  We required all participants to pay registration fees, 
was that an issue??  We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a 
session, was that an  issue?
?
Thanks in advance for your response.

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.






This would be analogous to every time you send me an e-mail, I forward it 
directly to Drew and Maria.  How do you tactfully advise your coworkers about 
corporate etiquette?  I wonder.
On a substantive note, I sincerely believe the analysis MKM wants is beyond 
the scope of this letter, and would have no qualms about sending it.

Now do you see why I didn't want to send this to Keith Petersen???  Anytime 
you send anything to Omaha, the MKM cult goes into their Satan worship 
chamber, they sing a few chants, and then sacrifice the good commercial 
effort to the demon regulatory god.  

Jeez, next time I'm gonna just send it out to the customer and ask for 
forgiveness later.

Subject: Order on TW Options

I just received a call from Nancy Bagot informing me that FERC has issued a 
draft order suspending our proposed Transport Options tariff sheets until May 
1, 2001 and accepting them subject to the outcome of a technical conference.  
The technical conference is to take place within 120 days of the order and 
will address issues raised in protests.
I should be receiving a copy of the draft order soon.  Please call or e-mail 
me if you have questions.


As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some 
reading and here are my thoughts.

The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission 
ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the 
Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  
Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that "any rate, 
charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, 
regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or 
classification" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the 
just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, 
or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain 
areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but 
"fixed" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California 
governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of 
wholesale electricity prices is questionable...

In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate 
the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its 
authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly 
authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just 
and reasonable.  "Just and reasonable" has been interpreted in many different 
contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.  
As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.  
However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 
above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated 
rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and 
unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire 
communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their 
electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous 
across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's 
transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices 
and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not 
widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer 
issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have 
already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just 
about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do 
need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the 
same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of 
monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew, 
obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a 
more in-depth report.

That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing 
I'm remembering , but I think there is some more specific law related to 
market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on 
market power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, you 
better not use it.  DF

Subject: Re: gouging  

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

Subject: gouging

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df    







For your information.  The outcome was great for TW because the Cal. PUC 
adopted our receipt point proposal, eliminating the danger of mandated 
restriction of TW's deliveries to the California border.  The outcome is not 
so great for Enron overall because they rejected our proposed settlement.  
The receipt point proposal was able to survive since it was part of both of 
the competing settlements.  
I'm still trying to get thru the whole order; let me know if you have 
questions.

Subject: Bad Proposed Decision

Well, this shows the direction in which the "new" Commission is heading.  The 
very good news, though, is that  TW's proposal was included in both 
settlements (now that's hedging!).  Thus,  the benefits to TW were preserved 
under both proposals.  Congratulations.  That's fantastic--hard work that 
paid off.

We will of course express out extreme dissappointment with the PD, and point 
out that this decision condemns California to a 20th century infrastructure, 
when the state's 21st century economy demands much, much better.  

We should discuss.  Since the PD empowers the likes of Norm and Florio, it 
will be important to play very close attention to implementation of Hector.

Sorry to have to be the one to deliver the news.   But we have a knack of 
making lemonade out of lemons and we'll do out best to do the same here, 
whatever turns up at the end.

The PD in the Gas Restructuring is out.   I have yet to read the whole
thing, but the title "Approval With Modifications Of The Interim
Settlement..." does not bode well.  According to Steve Watson (and I only
have Steve's statement second hand), the decision reflects a fear that the
timing is wrong in light of the current volatile gas price market.

Remember we need to make a filing for our BP Energy deal, which becomes 
effective Dec. 1.  (Mary, I think you and I talked about this several weeks 
ago).  The contract simply includes a right of first refusal for BP Energy.  
The contract is such that the shipper would not have been entitled to a ROFR 
under our tariff, which is why it's a material deviation.
The filing will simply need to reference a tariff sheet on which the contract 
provision is described.
Let me know if you need anything (a copy of the contract, for instance).
I have a conf. call from 2 to 3 but otherwise should be available if you want 
to give me a call.Maria and Drew, this is a long-winded e-mail but please bear with me...

The problem:

As you probably remember, several months ago several of us met to discuss the 
following language in the ROFR portion of Transwestern's tariff: "if the rate 
bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be 
the maximum tariff rate," and the additional frustrating language "[a]ll 
available capacity shall be allocated under these procedures . . .."  At our 
last meeting, we concluded that probably the best way to ensure that TW could 
capture the true value of the capacity would be to link the negotiated rate 
to index prices.  However, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount 
of risk to both the shipper and TW, the marketers haven't done any 
index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals.  I 
have been asked by the Commercial Group to revisit this issue and to think of 
other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum 
rate.   Ideally they would like to eliminate the language I've quoted above.  
However, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical 
change in the way FERC thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that TW 
lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language.

Why the problem exists (you may already know):

Steve Stojic and I did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in 
the first place.  In the Alternative Rates Policy Statement (RM95-6-000), the 
Commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for 
negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a 
cost-of-service based tariff rates.  "[T]he availability of a recourse 
service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that 
the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline 
unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service.  Thus, the 
recourse rate mitigates market power."  

The Commission went on to confirmed that under ROFR provisions the highest 
rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its 
transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate. This policy is clearly 
not limited to ROFR situations:  when capacity is constrained, a shipper 
willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely 
because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.  "When there are 
more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the 
pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either 
the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata 
basis if required by its tariff."  The example cited by the Commission:  If a 
pipeline has 100 Dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one 
who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a 
negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 Dth/d on a pro rata 
basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some 
other allocation method such as lottery).  

When TW filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added 
the statement that "if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the 
rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate."  Presumably we had 
concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order 
to receive negotiated rate authority.  

Solutions??

I would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language 
outright is probably out of the question.  I feel as if I've really been 
chasing my tail here.  I have owed Lindy an answer for some time now.  But I 
keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, Drew, is 
where I believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-October).  
Steve Harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the 
recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system.  I think we would still 
have to show lack of market power in order to do this.  Do you agree?  Stojic 
warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive 
proposition.  Might be worth it to us, though.

Another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more 
than max rate.  After all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates.  
We've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more 
than max rates for IT space based on good customer relations alone.  However, 
despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely 
we can pull this off with any consistency.  We wondered whether we might be 
able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure.  But 
I just am not convinced we could get around the Commission's requirement that 
recourse rates be available.  That requirement has not changed.  Have either 
of you seen anything to the contrary?  

I would like to meet with you two, plus several others I have in mind, to 
discuss this, preferably early this week (Tues. or Wed.), but would like to 
discuss briefly with you first.  Please call me so we can talk for a few 
minutes.  Thanks. 



 Lindy -- FYI.  This is just really informal so I'd prefer you not forward to 
anyone yet.  Drew and Maria are most familiar with this so I'm going to get 
their feedback first before setting up a meeting.  I'll get with you before I 
set a meeting time to see when you're available.

About three weeks ago, I inquired about EBA's  interest in organizing a
concurrent session at the upcoming IAEE (International  Association for
Energy Economics) conference in Houston (April  2001).

Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that  EBA was not interested.
It would help us a lot in our future planning  if you could perhaps help me
with your reasoning.  Did we approach you  too late (given the Dec 4
deadline)?   We required all participants to pay registration fees, was
that an issue?   We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a
session, was that an  issue?

Thanks in advance for your response.

Hi Ashley!  A couple of things.  First of all, my new renter, Doug, wonders 
whether he can just call the utilities & phone and transfer from his name to 
yours (rather than you cancelling and him having to pay any re-hookup fees 
that may apply).   I don't know how it would work; maybe he could conference 
you in when he makes the calls.  For what it is worth, he is a very nice guy 
to deal with, but it is totally up to you and I really don't care one way or 
the other. 

Also, I'm having someone come clean the place so you needn't worry about it, 
in case you were wondering.  I will take care of it (it looks pretty clean 
anyway!).  

Please let me know your new address and I will send you your deposit refund 
next week.

Merci!

SusanDoug, Ashley's e-mail address is in the cc line if you want to get in touch 
with her.  I hadn't thought that she might have had to put down a refundable 
deposit (rather than a hookup fee) for some of the utilities so logistically 
switching to your name might not be worthwhile, but it may be worth asking.  
Remember I have water covered.  Call or e-mail if you have questions!I believe Leslie does regulatory/legal work for ENA on a contract basis.

worry about driving all the way back to Tomball after partying downtown -- 
and we'd get to visit longer! 
Right now I'm home with some nasty bug that's been going around the office.  
It is a big drag.  Sheila came down with pneumonia right after Thanksgiving, 
and had to be hospitalized!  I think I should count myself lucky I only have 
the office bug.  She is back home now, and begging me not to make the trip to 
Austin.  Sounds like she is feeling a lot better.
We're having a surprise party for Craig's 40th on Friday!  I don't know 
whether he suspects anything...
Time for more cough medicine!

And we're coming to Houston!

Yeah! I am really looking forward to our trip to Houston this year! Got you 
message over Thanksgiving, hope you had a great (long) weekend! We stayed in 
town and helped out at the Santa Monica Civic Center then tried to find a 
turkey dinner to eat... nothin' like eatin' at a restaurant for 
Thanksgiving... :(

We are planning to arrive in Houston on Thursday the 21st and return back to 
LA on Tuesday the 26th. We'd love to get together with you (and your beau?) 
on Friday if you're still in town and are available! Mark and I love to trek 
downtown and see how the rest of the city lives outside of North Houston. Let 
me know if that works for you.

Hope you're having a good week. Talk to you soon, Sue

Date, time, and either of those places are fine with me, subject to
Frazier's availability.  This would be a good opportunity to discuss topics
for the luncheons, which Frazier and I have been trying to do for a while.
I also need to share with you some conversations I've been having with folks
at EBA in DC and proposals they are pushing at the Houston chapter.

Oooh, "venue." I like it.  The 24th is good with me.  How about either
Pappadeaux or Pappasito or anything else around the Kirby/59 area?  Should
take you guys the same amount of time getting out of downtown.   11:30? (to
beat the lunch crowd).

Susan,

I go this email as well.  Unfortunately, I've been busy as well and didn't
really look at it.  As for future matters, what will be our involvement for
EBA-Houston events?  Would the two of you like to get together for lunch
sometime, maybe with Frazier and the other current EBA officers so we can
understand our roles/duties/functions a little better (hey, aren't we both
pretty big clients of a certain Houston law firm? -- hint, hint, Charles  :

Subject:  24th IAEE International Conference




About three weeks ago, I inquired about EBA's  interest in organizing a
concurrent session at the upcoming IAEE (International  Association for
Energy Economics) conference in Houston (April  2001).

Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that  EBA was not interested.
It would help us a lot in our future planning  if you could perhaps help me
with your reasoning.  Did we approach you  too late (given the Dec 4
deadline)?   We required all participants to pay registration fees, was
that an issue?   We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a
session, was that an  issue?

Thanks in advance for your response.

Subject: Proposed Decision

The GD article today regarding the proposed decision is a pretty good Reade=
rs=20
Digest version of the order.  Susan and I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and Mark=
=20
Baldwin yesterday, and the consensus of those conversations was that=20
Transwestern should remain involved in this proceeding only for purposes of=
=20
implementation/documentation.  Jeff offered that he might send a letter to=
=20
Governor Gray's office expressing both dismay and indignation that the CPUC=
=20
didn't complete their task and warning of the adverse outcome to California=
=20
ratepayers if these more modest reforms are approved.  He may ask the other=
=20
Comprehensive Settlement parties to join in signing the letter.  Susan, Mar=
k=20
and I spoke about this idea later, and we've got some reservations about TW=
's=20
role in admonishing the CPUC.   We should probably wait to see this letter=
=20
first before committing to anything.

Bilas draft cautious toward SoCal competition
Mindful of the current chaos over energy markets in the state, California=
=20
Public Utilities
Commissioner Richard Bilas has recommended the adoption of a much more=20
moderate
approach to promoting competition on Southern California Gas=01, (SoCal) sy=
stem.
In his draft decision, Bilas advised the commission to reject the unbundlin=
g=20
of intrastate
transmission and instead approve the first settlement filed in the case, th=
e=20
less far-reaching
Interim Settlement (IS), submitted in December 1999. SoCal, San Diego Gas a=
nd=20
Electric and
other parties filed two more settlements after the IS, reaching a=20
comprehensive agreement in
April this year.

But since then, gas and power prices skyrocketed in the state, prompting a=
=20
consumer
backlash and giving competition a bad name.  The draft language notes that=
=20
the first interim
settlement was supported by more customer groups than the later agreements.
Recent events =01&lead us to conclude that the centerpiece of this=20
investigation, the unbundling
of intrastate transmission and the implementation of a system of firm,=20
tradable intrastate transmission rights, should be delayed,=018 according t=
o the=20
draft order.  =01&This unbundling is the basis of the [comprehensive settle=
ment]=20
and we cannot approve it. We do not, however, wish to commit to paralysis=
=20
until 2006, as the [post-interim settlement] would have us do. Accordingly,=
=20
we believe Californians are better served at this juncture by the adoption,=
=20
with modifications, of the IS.=018

The biggest change to the IS in the draft is the rejection of an automatic=
=20
capacity expansion
by SoCal at Wheeler Ridge, Calif., with rolled-in rates if certain criteria=
=20
are met.  El Paso
Energy had objected to the provision in the IS that would have allowed SoCa=
l=20
to automatically
expand capacity at Wheeler Ridge by 100 million cfd if a certain number of=
=20
curtailments oc-curred. =20
El Paso objected to forcing all shippers to pay for the expansion at Wheele=
r=20
when only certain customers would benefit. =20
The draft says SoCal can file a separate application for the Wheeler Ridge=
=20
expansion, but approval would be conditioned on a traditional hearing proce=
ss.

The draft decision would also:
=01=07 End SoCal=01,s current =01&windowing=018 process, which limits shipp=
ers=01, ability to=20
change nominations
for deliveries between receipt points on the system. It is replaced with an=
=20

daily calculation of capacity available at each receipt point;
=01=07 Establish Hector Road as a formal receipt point for nominations;
=01=07 Institute an operational flow order (OFO) procedure. Provides a foru=
m for=20
more changes
in OFO procedures if excessive OFOs are made;
=01=07 Set up =01&pools=018 of gas on the SoCal transmission system that ar=
e intended to=20
increase the
liquidity of gas trading;
=01=07 Make changes to balancing rules, while retaining the current 10% mon=
thly=20
imbalance
tolerance;
=01=07 Make SoCal=01,s own gas acquisition unit subject to the same balanci=
ng rules=20
and penalties
as all other shippers;
=01=07 Allow some limited imbalances trading, as well as the right to assig=
n and=20
reassign unbundled
storage contract in a secondary market, with a SoCal electronic bulletin=20
board set up
for it;
=01=07 Unbundle from core transportation rates the storage capacity cost ex=
ceeding=20
that required
for core minimum reliability; and
=01=07 Provide for rate recovery of up to $3.5 million in implementation co=
sts.

In addition, the draft would unbundle core interstate transportation from=
=20
rates, eliminate
core contribution to noncore interstate transition cost surcharges, elimina=
te=20
the core subscription
option as well as the caps for core aggregation programs.  The threshold fo=
r=20
participating in
core aggregation is reduced, and billing options are offered to core=20
aggregators.

Bilas=01, draft also warned that the commission may come back in two years =
to=20
open another
investigation into gas competition, taking into account any changes in mark=
et=20
conditions.
Bilas gave a little more insight into his decision in the text of the draft=
.
=01&The cost of gas as a commodity has vastly increased at the border, show=
ing a=20
differential
between the basin and border prices that is more than the cost of transport=
=20
and related services;
we question whether there will be an opportunity for discounting by markete=
rs=20
if more competition is allowed,=018=20
Bilas wrote in the draft decision.  =01&With half the state already committ=
ed to=20
a
restructured competitive natural gas industry, it suddenly seems as if the=
=20
benefits of such re-
structuring to enhance competition are speculative, particularly at this=20
time.  With one leg in the
water, the current has switched direction and it will be difficult, if not=
=20
foolhardy, to reach our
goals by forging ahead.

=01&We choose to take a cautious approach again,=018 the draft continues. =
=01&Rather=20
than proceeding
to unbundle transmission in Southern California now, we approve, with=20
modifications, the settle-
ment suggesting smaller steps towards a competitive market. Additionally, w=
e=20
unbundle core
interstate transmission and once again urge the Legislature to pass consume=
r=20
protection legisla-
tion aimed at unregulated marketers while we facilitate growth in core=20
aggregation programs.=018
The CPUC would not rule out the unbundling of intrastate transmission and=
=20
other restruc-
turing in the future =01&but believe that at this point in time the certain=
=20
benefits do not outweigh
the costs to most ratepayers.=018

All drafts must be filed 30 days before the meetings at which they will be=

discussed. The
draft decision is currently on the agenda for the CPUC=01,s Dec. 21 meeting=

Lorraine, please forward the attached to Ed Meaders.
Steve and Lindy, as I mentioned in our staff meeting, it is probably not=20
going to be possible to solve our max rate cap dilemma by making a tariff=
=20
filing unless we can 1) get FERC to change its mind about its policy that=
=20
recourse rates always be available as an alternative to negotiated rates or=
=20
2) prove that Transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allow=
ed=20
to charge market based rates.

The following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove la=
ck=20
of market power.  A warning:  lack of market power is very difficult to=20
prove.  Koch, a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack=20
market power, tried and failed.  The deck is already stacked against us in=
=20
TW's case given the withholding of capacity by El Paso's affiliate and the=
=20
price conditions in California.  However, we do need to analyze the=20
possibilities for TW, if not to the Cal. border, then on other parts of our=
=20
system.  Additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipper=
s=20
to pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff.

Would you be availabile on Tuesday to discuss this?  Please let me know.  I=
n=20
the meantime, here is a summary of FERC's policy on market based rates.

***

To obtain authority to charge market based rates, TW would first have to=20
request a declaratory order, and in its application provide information=20
showing it meets the requirements outlined below.  If the Commission finds=
=20
all requirements have been met, it will issue an order and TW would then ma=
ke=20
the appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect.
=20
Application for declaratory order must include:

1.  Detailed description of the services proposed for market-based rate=20
treatment.  I assume in our case it would be firm transportation service.

2.  A statement defining the relevant product and geographic markets=20
necessary for establishing the applicant lacks market power with respect to=
=20
the services at issue.  The Commission requires a narrow definition of the=
=20
market=01("firm transportation" is probably narrow enough, but for our purp=
oses=20
we might want to narrow it down more (i.e., firm transportation East of=20
Thoreau).  We have to define substitute services available to shippers=01(o=
ther=20
pipelines are a "good substitute" only if shippers can obtain the same=20
quality of service on a timely basis, and if the other pipelines offer such=
=20
service at a price that would deter TW from raising its prices more than=20
10%.  All relevant "origin markets" must be defined (Panhandle; West Texas)=
=20
as well as "destination markets," and alternatives for shippers in those=20
markets identified.  Transportation alternatives are only good alternatives=
=20
if they provide a netback to shippers that is roughly the same as if they=
=20
used TW.  Note that the Commission has rejected capacity release as a good=
=20
alternative since it does not guarantee a shipper its desired contract=20
quantity.

3.  Market share and HHI calculations; discussion of other relevant=20
competitive factors.  Commission looks at size of market share, mitigating=
=20

4.  Proposal for accounting for costs and revenues.Received your message.  Do we want to file a response to PNM's protest?  It 
basically contains the same arguments they launched at our 637 filing, and we 
did not file an answer to that.Kevin -- I've looked at the pooling agreement and I agree with you -- I don't 
believe taking the compressor down is at all limited under the agreement.  
Any further questions, let me know.Well, I have definitely taken a turn for the worse -- lots of drainage and 
coughing up green/yellow stuff.  No fever at all, though.  I go to the doctor 
tomorrow and hopefully will be on the road to recovery before Saturday.  

Received Jim's capilene shirts; they are nice.  But I wanted to double check 
with you to make sure I got the right ones -- he wanted the medium-weight 
ones that are sort of like long-sleeved t-shirts, right?  The reason I am 
asking is that Patagonia also makes a capilene that is more like a fleece 
fabric and comes in a v-neck style...

I will hold off on the bathtub spa for Mema.  The last thing I want to do is 
buy her something she does not need!  Will stick to my pedicure gift 
certificate idea.  

So glad you are doing better.  Too bad there was a delay in the flu vaccine 
this year or we both could have avoided a lot of trouble!

The doc thinks I probably had the flu.

Can we get together tomorrow to discuss the market based rates issues I 
raised last week?
If you can do it tomorrow, let me know what times you are not available and 
I'll schedule something around them.  Thanks.We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF

S.Shelley, I can take a stab at pulling together TW-related information today 
and will run it by Jeff to see whether he has anything to add.  I am leaving 
on vacation Saturday and have a lot of other work to finish up here before I

Subject: Calif. Performance Issues

With concerns about curtailments and force majuere events in California, 
Steve Kean has asked for the preparation of study of all possible types of 
disruptions (e.g. curtailment, diversion, penalties, etc,) in the gas chain 
flowing to Calif and who bears the legal/financial liability for each event.  
Specifically, he has asked if ETS can assemble a description of such 
provisions for the pipes delivering to Calif.

In particular, he wants a summary of following:

Curtailment - When do pipelines curtail? 
Curtailment compensation
Imbalance Provisions
Penalties/OFOs
Allocations (For El Paso Only)

Help!  Do you guys have any materials explaining these provisions?  Steve 
wants this all pulled together by Friday.

Subject: Behavioral Profile of Risk Management Personnel

I want to recap our understanding of the key cultural/behavioral attributes 
that you said were important to interview for.      If you want to add to 
this please don't hesitate to do so.   We will form a questionnaire tailored 
to your group's needs. 

The right candidate will desire an environment that will challenge them with 
new situations on a constant day to day basis.   This person would become 
bored and restless with routine.   This person would also enjoy learning at a 
relatively fast and voluminous rate. 
The candidate will rarely lose a train of thought despite interruptions and 
can return to the point at which a discussion or idea was disrupted.   There 
are techniques as well as questions that can address this. 
The person must indicate a high degree of dependability, endurance, 
follow-through, and persistence.   They must be equipped with an ability to 
cope with adversity and be willing to do what it takes to get it done.    
They must not be adverse to working beyond the 45hr week.    It is difficult 
for the candidate to create a story that combines examples of all of these 
traits unless it truly happened.   If they have these traits, they have used 
them in the past. 
Relatively thick skinned.   How do they accept criticism and/or reprimands?   
A desire to be in control of situations is also a desirable trait.  These 
applicants must want to make decisions and control outcomes almost all of the 
time.   Not to be confused with micro-managers or control freaks 
(yeah-buts).   
Lastly, they must have an entrepreneurial focus.    They need to be the 
people that make it happen, with possibilities but without guarantees  of 
personal gain, a desire to take ultimate responsibility, and influence others 
to get it done and make them feel good about it.   The how, what, when, 
where, and why of being in a leadership role. 

We will start formulating the questions and the order in which they should be 
asked today.   Do you have any candidates in the near future?   We would be 
glad to help you with interviewing tips.   
hgm

Lillian, please see the attached authorization memo.  It is still in draft 
form, but since time is of the essence, Geneva advised me to forward it to 
you now so that you could start working on it.  We would like to have the new 
company formed today if possible.  I will let you know if I make any changes 
to the attached.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to call if you have 
questions.

Susan Scott
x30596
I'm confused -- are we asking for an extension of time to comply with the 
Commission's conditions, or an extension of time to file a motion for 
rehearing?  Lillian, I forgot to add that the slate of directors and officers for 
Capacity Management Corp. will be identical to that of Transwestern Pipeline 
Company.,Steve Stojic called to let me know that the technical conference in RP01-56 
will be held on Jan. 9 at 10:00.  A notice will be issued shortly.  Don't you have work to do??

OK, here's my 2 cents' worth:

Avale Corp.
I also like Enable.
I think either one would look fine on an EBB list of customers...

Also -- any name we choose could include the words Capacity Management.  But 
I'm not sure we want to or need to be that descriptive.

This document contains both the El Paso and TW information.  I'll bring you 
the printouts of the relevant El Paso tariff provisions.
Just so you can see how this is evolving...
I think we should steer clear of anything involving Energy Services because 
it sounds like we are buying/selling gas.
I've instructed the commercial group to get back to you with a name.  When 
they do, let Lillian Bailey know (x33577).  That is really the only 
information she still needs from us, I think.

Subject: Re: NewCo names  

OK, here's my 2 cents' worth:

Avale Corp.
I also like Enable.
I think either one would look fine on an EBB list of customers...

Also -- any name we choose could include the words Capacity Management.  But 
I'm not sure we want to or need to be that descriptive.

Subject: Annuity QG1453

George Gilbert entered an Annuity and changed the status to Not To Be 
Confirmed.  This will not be settled by settlements because no comments were 
entered to be Settled Financially.  Do you know what this annuity is related 
to?

Please let me know.

Thank you,

Janie Aguayo
Financial Confirmations
Contrary to popular belief I am alive...The 22nd works for me too (although 
given my current work situation I'm sure I'd be late - better late than 
never, right?)  Anyway, both of the current suggestions sound good ( I've 
been to Benji's - great food and heard really good things about Ousie's table 
as well).  

But Laura was right, Lisa is currently my social planner - how scarey is 
that? - so she'll make sure I know what's going on.

Can't wait to see you guys,
Susan

Subject: Christmas Dinner


Girls-
Thank you for the responses.  So far it has been overwhelmingly
positive!  I really can't wait to get us all together.  Emily had
suggested Ousies's Table-as well as a coworker of mine.  Yesterday
during our lunch break we went and looked at Ousies's and it seems
pretty cute.  Unfortunately they were not open, but I heard they light
it up at night and it is supposed to be really pretty.  The other
suggestion is Benji's.  Lis-you made a good point.  It would be nice to
try somewhere new.
I have not heard from Sarah or Kelly-so if you talk to them-please pass
them the message.  I know Kelly usually checks her email, but I am not
sure about Sarah.  If anyone has a number for her-let me know.  I also
haven't heard from Susan Scott-so Lisa- you are in charge of that.
Ashley-I know you've gotten this message-so reply!  : )
Corinne-Sorry that you will not be able to make it. : (  If anything
changes-let us know.
Jen's flight comes in around 7 that night-so I thought we would make the
reservations for 8-830 so she has time to make it.
Let me know what ya'll think.
-Laura



As it appears I will be living and breathing the 32nd floor of the Enron 
building well through the first of the year, I've decided to break down and 
try to maintain my friendships via email.  You all know me well enough to 
know that this a huge step on my part ( I am not the world's best emailer).  
Anyway, I feel like I'm out of touch with what's going on in your collective 
lives and am thus missing out on some pretty wonderful, exciting and special 
things.  So when and if any of you get a chance shoot me back a quick note 
and let me know what's new in your life.

Love you guys,
Susan

Jennifer - Hope work is going well.  I know this time of year has got to be 
crazy for anyone in your line of work, but I'm sure you're handling it well.  
We really need to go grab coffee, dinner, a movie or something soon.  I'm in 
need of a good chat.

Jessica - I know you're in the midst of finals right now and probably about 
to pull your hair out.  Just focus on the fact that they'll be over soon and 
you'll be off to London to see Ashley and Lee ( I am so jealous).  Please 
tell Clay I say hello and wish him good luck as well on y'alls exams.

Lisa - Hey sweetie!  I am so sorry I couldn't make it to your shower in SA, 
but Jen said it went really well.  We need to get together soon I've missed 
seeing you and especially hearing about the wedding and all the fun goings 
ons in your life.  Tell Brad I say "Hi" and I'll be glued to the TV set just 
like him on the on the 29th rooting on the Horns.

Emily - I really want to hear how your Thanksgiving went with Thomas and the 
"Fam".  Knowing Thomas it went great and your entire family (especially your 
Mom) is absolutely in love with him.  Keep me posted on your plans for the 
future ( I'm curious where you're going to end up geographically).  Also, I 
thought you'd find it interesting that I may have an opportunity to work in 
your old hometown - Chicago.  Any thoughts?

Elizabeth - I have really been out of touch with you and I am very mad at 
myself for letting that happen.  Please write back soon and let me know how 
school, your family and this new man in your life ( okay, I'm not completely 
out of touch) are all doing.  My guess is you're going through exams as well 
right now so I'll wish you the best of luck and infinite success.---------------------- Forwarded by Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT on 12/12/2000 08:58

Christine, you need a comma between July and August.  Otherwise this looks 
fine.

The book code is ALWAYS - XZ.  As for trade dates, that is not one of the 
fields I fill in for the exotics spreadsheet and I don't think that's 
something we'd really want to add as the file already takes up an extremely 
large amout of memory.

Hey Bronwyn,

I just realized I never emailed you back ( I am a bad, bad person).  Glad to 
hear things are going well with you.  It was so neat to run into you in 
Houston, I see your brother around the building quite a bit but I don't think 
he recognizes me.  I'll have to make a point to reintroduce myself the next 
time I see him.  

So what's new with you?  Have you moved?  I know you were thinking about LA a 
while back...I've got a couple of friends from high school who are living out 
there and are really having a good time.  Anyway, I completely understand the 
urge to try something new.  I too am thinking of making a move before next 
summer ( I don't know exactly where, but somewhere outside of Texas...I 
really need to experience something different).  Speaking of which, Emily is 
in London going to graduate school right now.  I've already been to visit her 
once there and she's trying to talk me into moving over there.  I would 
actually love to go, if there was a job with Enron there that interested me.  

As for my dating life, it is relatively unchanged.  I was seeing one guy for 
a while, really liked him, things were going great ( I thought )...then he 
seemed to loose interest and decided 2 mos. into things to tell me he has 
issues and that he'd been married before.  Needless to say, that was pretty 
much the end of things.  It's made me a little hesitant when it comes to 
meeting new guys, but at the same time I had so much fun in the beginning 
that I'm still optimistic about my dating future.  How about you?

Concerning Kappa...I'll give you a run down on everyone I still keep in touch 
with.  Corey's in Law School at Texas ( doing great of course) and has 
already secured a clerkship with a federal judge in Galveston when she 
graduates.  Jessica Bateman is now Jessica Pulliam - and she too is in Law 
School at Texas and has secured a federal clerkship with a judge in Dallas 
when she graduates.  Elizabeth's is in Med School in San Antonio and dating a 
fellow med student there.  Stephanie Spence is now Stephanie Williams and is 
living and working in Dallas.  Lisa Meador is getting married next April to a 
guy from Texas ( he was a KA, there Brad Thealman (sp?) ) who is absolutely 
perfect for her.  That about sums it up, but if there's anyone else you're 
wondering about just ask...I can probably find out some scoop.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hi Susan!  How are you?  It was so good seeing you when I was in Houston!  I 
really had tried to find out your e-mail address b/c I've often wondered what 
your were up to.  I'm glad to hear your enjoying work.  Are you happy to be 
back in Houston?  (I guess you've been back for awhile now...)  How's your 
family?  Do you still talk to Emily?

I've visited Houston every so often to see Ryan...I still always have the 
greatest time when I visit.  I'm trying to decide right now where I want to 
live.  I have the flexibility with my job to live wherever I choose, so I've 
been thinking about LA.  I'm torn though b/c I like Houston, too.  I'm 
thinking about just playing in LA for about a year and then probably settling 
down in Houston.  We'll see...

What else is going on with you?  Are you dating any one?  Do you still keep 
in touch with any Kappas?

Well, sorry for all the questions, but I can't wait to hear from 
you...hopefully, we can stay in touch!

Take care, Bronwyn

I re-compiled Exotica.xll, so that the xcol function is a put on collar.

De-add in your Exotica. Add this special one. And use xcol for put.

Then delete the Exotica_xcol_putoncollar.xll

We will build in this functionality in near future.

Hey guys,

Just wanted to let you know that Kori Loibl has offered up her apartment as a 
Pre-party spot.  The financial desk will be there as well as Purvi & her 
boyfriend and  Mo "the bomb" Sanchez and her fianc,e John.  Don't know if you 
guys have any interest, but the offer's open.  Either way, we'll have to find 
someplace extend the festivities after the X-mas party shuts down...(the 
Black Swan, Eu-grope-a, etc).

SusanHere are some of the main curves....attached is a file containing the rest.

Good job on the organization.  Do you have any recommendations for what I

double check, we're getting together next Monday night right?

SusanSorry Beatrice,

I sent this to Greg and forgot to send it to you as well.  This is a

Hi Susan,

Would you please forward the current spreadsheet with exotics?

Thanks, 
Beatrice

Call me with any questions.  I'll send you the final version when I have the 
official NGI settle prices.

SusanPlease include my name on the list of attendants for the brown bag tomorrow.

Thank you,
Susan ScottDan,

I am currently sitting in the Coal group's old area on 32.  While dealing 
with some computer issues Friday, I came across an expandable file full of 
Coal related documents buried beneath my desk.  The documents and contracts 
seem pretty old, which is why I assume no one has missed them.  Still, I 
wanted to contact you to see if you would like me to run them down rather 
than simply discard them.  If you could email or call me at x31455 and let me 
know what I should do with them I would appreciate it (as you know space is 
limited up here).

Thanks,
SusanHey K!  Thanks for the note.  Everyone is asking how you're doing.  Sorry to 
hear about your back; I know what it is like.  As much as you are inclined to 
run around and get things done, the thing that worked best for me with my 
back problem was just to recline as much as possible!  My house truly became 
a mess, but guess what, the world did not end.  

I really like your monosyllabic choices for names:  Kyle and Quinn.  For some 
reason I really like the name Elizabeth with both of those.  Perhaps because 
it balances out the unisex quality of the first name.  I think you really 
have to meet the baby before you decide for sure.  Who knows, she might turn 
out to be more of a Gladys!  heh, heh!

The landscapers are almost finished with my yard.  It looks really good.  I 
even have a little palm tree -- required for the Heights.  The last thing is 
to finish the driveway -- right now there are 20 tons of black star gravel 
sitting in the back yard!

Time to work.
Try to take it easy!

Subject: stuff



Hey Susan! Sorry no e-mail lately. Things have been busy at work. I am also
tardy on my xmas thankyou notes so I'm hoping a computer one will suffice
for you! What would Miss Manners say? Needless to say we love all the stuff
you gave us. I am enjoying the knives - what a difference they make. No more
sawing!  Jim has worn his new shirt many times and loves the book. I too
thought it was a good Christmas, despite the pre-Christmas funk many of us
went through! It all turned out ok - even our time with Yvette wasn't so
bad!

Things are moving along in baby world. P-nut is moving downwards,
alleviating the pain in my ribs, but now causing sciatica (sp?)  in my right
hip and leg. I feel creaky and it hurts to walk. Not cool - I have too many
things left to do around the house to have to stay off my feet. Oh well. i
suppose it will all get done. We are still searching for the right name and
now need some input since we can't seem to make a decision between us. Here
are our latest choices in no particular order - Grayson, Kyle, Quinn,
Kendall, Lindsey, and Hayley (may be too popular). My favorite combination
is Grayson Scott Shelton. Jim likes Kyle Elizabeth Shelton or Kyle Alison.
Yes, we know Kyle is usually a boy's name, but we had a female intern at JRA
one summer named Kyle and I thought it was cool. One of my baby name books
has both Kyle and Quinn on the "truly unisex names" list. Any comments or
new suggestions are appreciated!

Must get going on work. Hope to hear from you soon.

Karin

Larry, 

For some reason the mail router keeps rejecting the files I'm trying to send 
you (GDOpt&Swap and PipePos).  If you have access to the rest of the system 
here you should be able to get into the PipOpt folder with out any problems.  
If you don't end up coming in tomorrow I'll get with IT and try and figure 
out a way to email you these files.  Give me a call at 713-853-1455 if you 
need anything.

I went ahead and attached a copy of your P&L from Friday if you want to take 
a look at that.  I tried calling you with the number, but I never got an 
answer.  Also, there was a confirm that came in for you Friday with Amerex:  
They show you Buying a 1/day  BOM (12/2-12/31) HeHub Gas Daily $7.00 Call 
Option at $0.26.  The counterparty was Cinergy...Let me know if this is a 
good trade and we'll get it loaded into the system.

Thanks,
Susan

Susan,

Attached in the file are the testing results.

 Also you can run a script file to test more PID/deals if you'd like . This 
script file uses my modified version of PORTCALC, and  is on  UNIX,:
  ~stang/port_calc_test.csh you can go to my home  directory  ~stang, then 
type port_calc_test.csh PID and run it.

The apartment complex needs for you to fax them a statement saying you are no 
longer living in our apartment and they need it by tomorrow morning.  If I 
don't here from you via email/msngr  by the end of tonight I'm going to forge 
one and fax it to them.  Actually, I can do that regardless if you don't 
mind.  Just drop me a line and let me know what works for you.

Hope things are going well.  I actually worked 21 straight hours the other 
day/night (7:45 am Tuesday until 4:45 am Wednesday)...I think this 
constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.---------------------- Forwarded by Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT on 11/29/2000 10:13

Well, how does it feel to be back?  I'm sure, even though our fair city can't 
compete with London for history and culture, there are a few things you've 
missed about this place.  Hope the flight back was good and I'm sure I'll be 
seeing you around.

SusanOn January 13, 2000, FERC issued a Section 7(c) certificate for 
Transwestern's Gallup Expansion.  The Commission's order contained two 
conditions:  1) that Transwestern file its discounted rates within 15 days of 
the order, and 2) that Transwestern restructure its relationship with Enron 
Compression Services so that Transwestern will have sufficient operation 
control over the motor at the Gallup compressor station to assume regulatory 
responsibility for the motor's operation, and that Transwestern file a report 
with the Commission stating how it complied with this condition.  
Transwestern accepted the  certificate January 14, 2000 but reserved the 
right to seek rehearing or clarification of the order.  On January 18, 2000, 
Transwestern filed a motion for extension of time to comply with the 
condition that Transwestern file its discounted rates.  Transwestern has 
already filed with the Commission the discounted rates it will charge its 
expansion shippers, subject to a request for confidentiality.   Transwestern 
intends to file a request for rehearing of the January 13 order explaining 
why the Commission erred in ordering Transwestern to publicly disclose its 
discounted rates in advance of the normal time for making such disclosure 
through a discount report.  If you could run the same valuation for Deal #'s QC1431.1 and QC1431.2 using 
Post-id 956785, we could verify that they changes you've made correctly value 
the basis offset whether a deal index flat or index +/- .  Call me if you 
have any questions.

Thanks, 
SusanThe deals included below are strictly index flat gas daily options.  I'm 
going to send Shouan an Index +/- deal as well so that he can verify that the 
basis offset is valuing correctly in both situations.

Actually, if you don't expect me to keep up with you the whole 8K's, I could 
probably muster up the energy.  Besides, I'm planning on sleeping the entire 
way out there so I'll end up getting more sleep that night than normal.  Do I 
need to do anything to sign up for the run?

Houston at 11:00 pm and getting into SD around 2:20 in the morning.  The next 
earlier flight leaves Houston around 5:30 pm but unfortunately there's no way 
I could make that one because of  work.  The other option is to fly in 
Saturday morning like I did last time.  I'm leaning towards leaving Friday 
night and just taking a cab to your place as long as you don't mind waking up 
to let me in.  That way we'd have all day Saturday to do things and I 
wouldn't leave on Sunday until around 3:30 (or I could even leave around 
6:00).  Anyway, I was just wondering what you think about the various 
options?  Let me know and I'll try and book this thing today.

I found the picture from Tin Hall the other night and that guy at Whataburger 
was definitely one of the "cute cowboys."  How weird is that?  Anyway, hope 
you're flight home and immediate transition to the classroom went smoothly.  
I guess I'll be seeing you in about two weeks and by that time, hopefully, 
I'll know more about my London prospects.

Susan   I'd told my theory to my friend Linda, who wanted to be a social scientist 
and was always coming up with theories herself.  I'd concluded that breasts 
were to sex what pillows were to sleep.  "Guys might think they want a 
pillow, but they'll sleep just as well without one."
     She'd said, "Guys will sleep anywhere if they're really tired."Start at the bottom and work your way up....I'd forgotten this is how I get 
over guys, flush-out the shortcomings of their wit.

Well, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've 
taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT 
good.  Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not 
too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a 
force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm 
right.  With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the 
charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager 
to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance 
Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.  My 
condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .

Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie 
co-workers through this trying time.

Susan

(Oh and Chip, I'd store the Gig'em sweater-vest away for the next 360 days or 
so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule...in a round about way you are 
an "Ag" man now.)






Lorraine, see the attached.  I added "Maximum" and "Minimum" to the chart but 
don't know whether I got it backwards...anyway, let's talk if you have any 
questions.
It was very small and petty of me, but I couldn't resist.  Start with the 
last message and work your way up to get the full story.  

Good luck studying,

Well, given the impressive results of Friday's game, I suppose I should've 
taken the bet...I mean I knew we were good, but I didn't realize we were THAT 
good.  Watching the game I couldn't help but remember some comments made not 
too long ago about this being a building season and that the Horns would be a 
force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - I love it when I'm 
right.  With an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the 
charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager 
to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit Chance 
Mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch.  My 
condolences on your prospects not looking quite as bright .

Hope you had a nice Thanksgiving and good luck helping all of your Aggie 
co-workers through this trying time.

(Oh and Chip, I'd store the Gig'em sweater-vest away for the next 360 days or 
so if you want to avoid any post-game ridicule...in a round about way you are 
an "Ag" man now.)






Although, as a women, "cojones" aren't necessarily the best attribute to 
have...there never has been, nor will there ever be a question of my 
possessing them - even you would have to concede that much.  As for the bet, 
if I recall correctly (and I always do) someone once said they had a little 
bit of a "problem" gambling and I could not in good conscious have acted as 
an enabler.  And, a true fan (longhorn or not) is there through the good 
times and the bad and believe me I been there through it all (a degrading 
loss to your alma mater, as well as an unbelievably beautiful victory over 
Nebraska) always managing to stick it out no matter how bleak things got.  
Speaking of which it must sting being beat by the last place team in your 
conference...but I'm sure the Pac-10's record against non-conference 
opponents is really helping to ease that blow.  Speaking of feather's in the 
conference cap, looks like our next national champion is going to be from the 
Big 12 - will wonders never cease.

My Monday is going great, thank you very much and I will show extreme 
restraint and refrain from any Chips comments ( Besides, I don't have time to 
type that much ).  UCLA could stand a chance next year if the NFL doesn't 
prove too tempting to some of your vets...how does that saying go,  "Like 
rats fleeing a sinking ship?"

This email would have been impressive if you had the "cojones" to bet 
up-front but being a true longhorn fan explains your lack of spine.  I don't 
think Texas is that good rather A&M is that bad.  Besides, we all know that 
the Pac-10 had the best record against non-conference opponents.  UCLA will 
dominate next year and Texas will be forced to play second fiddle to the

I was wondering if there was a fax number at the base so that my apartment 
complex can send you some info.  regarding getting your name taken off of our 
lease.  If there is, just shoot me off an email with the number and I'll pass 
it along to them.

Hope things are going well and that you're not too homesick with Thanksgiving 
and all.  I have a feeling I will be talking to you guys tomorrow along with 
both of our parents and extended family members.  Have a great holiday and 
root on the Horns ( I think this is going to be a tough one).

Love,
SusanSorry it took me so long to get back to you.  Unfortunately, I'm not a 
betting woman (I'm afraid any team I bet on is automatically jinxed and I 
can't vote against my alma mater)...so I will kindly refrain from any 
wagers.  

Have a great Thanksgiving Holiday,
Susan

The options book is still the options book and I think I will have put in at 
least 36 of my 40 hours this week.  I know, I know...I'm not working hard

So are you up for any friendly or unfriendly bets on this weeks big show
down?  I don't think the lines are out yet but I'm sure you guys will be
favored by at least a touchdown.  So I'll take the Aggies +7.  How about the
loser either picks up the first round or the whole night the next time we
hit the town, although the later might be pretty steep.  Don't know if your
a gambling gal but I thought I would at least present this opportunity to
you.

Anyway, how's the old option book?  Are you getting a handle on the whole
macro thing?  Look on the bright side it is only a three day week and I'm
sure you'll get the whole 40 in.

Take it easy.

Here are a couple of deals to look at.

Q22452.1 and Q97452.2


Thanks,
SusanOkay, there's a flight out of Houston on the 15th that gets into SD at 10:45 
pm and the return flight is on Sunday around 3:30.  If that works for you I'm 
going to go ahead and book the ticket now.  

I'm so glad to hear that you're move was such a rousing success.  As for 
myself and all of the guy juggling, I'm trying to get that under control.  
Truth be told, none of them are worth a dime.  I think it was more of an ego 
thing on my part.  Anyway, I still can't see the point in wasting time on 
guys I'm not interested in so (like I said) I've ceased the rampage.  I'm not 
taking any time off for Christmas so this trip would be a very welcomed 
respite.

Let me know about the times.

Susan Hey Julie,

Congratulations on the promotion, that's so exciting (I'm sure you've more 
than earned it).  

I just wanted to drop a line and see how work,  your new apartment/roommate 
and Brendan are all doing.  All are wonderful I hope.  I realize this is 
somewhat random, but I just found some great airfares from Houston to San 
Diego ($99 each way!!!) and was wondering what you were doing the weekend of 
Dec. 15?  I know this time of year is kind of crazy so I will totally 
understand if you have holiday parties, etc. to attend.  Regardless, this 
deal is good for travel through the end of February 2001, so....if it doesn't 
look like it's going to work before the end of the year, maybe I could make a 
visit mid-January or February.  

Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.

SusanI completely forgot to call you this afternoon...it got kind of crazy around 
here.  If you're going to be at the flat any time tomorrow shoot me off and 
email and I'll call you in the morning, ....otherwise I'll talk to you 
tomorrow when you get to H-town.It sounds great...we'll figure out a good time then.  I've really missed you 
guys these last few weeks.  I've been completely MIA.Hi Mum!  Well, I mustered the courage to start my bathroom painting project 
yesterday.  I chose a medium blue that looks very nice.  Guess who helped 
me?  Bill!  He got pretty enthusiastic with that roller.  So we were able to 
knock it out in about 3 hours.  There was a lot of woodwork to tape off.  
Tonight I will finish the tub area, which needed some 
repair/caulking/spackling.  Now I am anxious to do the bedroom, but probably 
will not get to it until next month.  Maybe you will be able to help me 
decide on a color when you are here this weekend.  I'm torn between "Happy 
Yellow" and a lighter version of the blue I used in the bathroom.  If I 
decide to paint any of the downstairs, I believe I will entrust that work to 
the professionals.

Got 4 tickets to the dance performance.  Since Bill seems to genuinely enjoy 
dance, I invited him.  So that leaves us with one ticket.  If you would like 
to invite someone, just let me know; otherwise maybe one of my friends around 
here will join us.

Hope your weekend project was a success.  

Talk to you soon!

Love,
S.Bryan, 

Are you still having a great time?  So what is Bali like?  The only images I 
can summon are Gauguin's paintings, but weren't those of Tahiti?  

Things are pretty good here.  Lots of Christmas parties, lots of Christmas 
cheer, etc.  Not a whole lot going on at the office, for a change.  Really, 
though, I think I would much rather be in Bali.  

Take care.

S.Hey Darren,

It's funny you mentioned Wilson because I just got an email from him this 
morning.  He seems to think he'll be in Houston in the near future as well.  
Hopefully, we can all get together and go out or hit steak night for some 
cold ones.  So H-town for six weeks hugh?  Why the mixed feelings?  Are they 
work related or were you just starting to get settled in London?  Anyway, 
I'll have to give Nick a call about the big news...I may have an idea what 
it's all about but then again maybe not.  So what's with this Kiwi girl?  
Because, I actually have made some progress regarding London.  Turns out 
there may be some structuring and originating opportunities for me over there 
which would be much more in line with where I'd like my "career" to be going 
versus the other opportunities I was being offered.  Either way, I won't be 
going over until March or April of next year so it's still a ways off.

As for the guy scene...yes, there has been some courting but nothing really 
to speak of.  I've gone out on a couple of dates but I can't say I really see 
them going anywhere.  Most of the guys around my age are still pretty 
insecure and I'm never going to be the kind of girl that wants to "shape and 
mold them" into men...I just don't have the patience or the inclination.  And 
the other end of the spectrum (single guys in their late 30's/early 40's) who 
seem to hover around like gnats just give me the creeps.  Oh well, as I've 
said before "hope springs eternal".

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Sue,
How are you?  What's new in H-town?  Any new guys on the scene--doing
their 'courting'?  I will be coming back to Houston for 6 weeks in a week!
Actually kind of excited--mixed feelings though.  So, Nick has some big 
news that I think would only be right for you to hear from him.  An aside,
if you come to London, I know a fun Kiwi girl that wants to move closer to
work--just looking out for you Susan.  Made any progress on getting over
here?  

Hopre you are well.  I'll call you when I get into town.
--Darren

Hey Wilson,

Yep, I'm still in Houston for the time being...I'll probably be here through 
March of next year when my current rotation ends.  Everything's going pretty 
well, work is still consisting of long hours but I think ultimately the hard 
work is going to pay off.  In fact, the whole London thing is looking pretty 
good right now.  There might be an opportunity for me to get into some 
structuring and originating roles over there which is much more along the 
lines of where I'd like to go (versus this whole trader support thing - great 
experience for the time being, but definitely not a permanent role).  Glad to 
hear things are still well with you.  Sounds like you're still the same old 
Wilson...working deals and hooking-up.  You'll have to let me know when 
you're going to be in town so we can get the gang together to go out.  It 
looks like Darren's going to be back in town for about 6 weeks or so coming 
up so hopefully we could all make a steak night reunion.  

I've been going out quite a bit as well and have had a couple dates, but 
nothing really to speak of.  I was kind of on a rampage over the last month 
just messing with guys heads (flirting, getting them to buy me drinks, giving 
them my number and then completely ignoring them).  I think it was some need 
I had to treat your entire gender like shit.  I'm pretty much over it 
though.  It's not really in my nature to be like that, just a reactionary 
thing for having been treated like crap myself.  

Keep in touch and let me know when you're going to be in town.

Susan

Hey, I'll try and give you a call tonight at your flat.  As far as "free 
nights" over Thanksgiving go...I'm pretty much open Tues, Wed, Fri and Sat.  
Katy and I are very excited about taking you out to get some REAL 
margaritas.  I can't remember where your favorite ones are, but where ever 
they may be the drinks are on me.  (Although given your increased tolerance 
these days, you may break me).  The reason I was asking about when you were 
coming home is...Jeffy Jeff is playing Gruene Hall the 15th and 16th of 
December and If you were up to it, I thought it'd be a good weekend trip for 
you, Katy, myself and whomever else may want to tag along (especially since 
it doesn't look like we'll be making it to Gruene over New Years).  Plus, if 
we did go I think I could swing leaving Friday night and not coming back 
until Monday morning...The outlet mall is calling your name.  

Talk to you soon,
Susan

PS - I have encouraging news regarding London, I'll tell you more about it 
when I talk to you.

Strangely enough a Tuesday night would probably be better for me too.  I 
think an all girls gift exchange would be really fun but, as you guys well 
know, I'm up for anything.  As for restaurants, I just tried this new place 
called Bossa's and it was really good.  It's right across from the Rice Hotel 
downtown and has a neat atmosphere.  Of course there are also all kinds of 
places around our "area of town" that would be great as well...PF Chang's, Mi 
Luna, Americas, La Griglia (sp?), etc. etc.  Just let me know the time and 
place.

Thanks again Lisa for organizing all of this, you're the greatest.

Susan

PS- If any one has an urge to grab a bite to eat or coffee either tonight or 
tomorrow night let me know.  I feel like I haven't seen you guys in forever.I definitely want to renew, but as you know I never get home before the 
leasing office closes.  I've got paintball Saturday morning but I know that 
won't take all day so maybe I can go by in the afternoon to sign any 
necessary papers.  My guess is you'll need to sign some papers as well.

Sue,

We had a message from the apt. office about renewing our lease. If we renew 
we can get our carpet cleaned for free, I THINK?  Let me know if you need me 
to do anything.  They have been sending you the renewal notices and leaving 
you the messages, so I am not sure if you need to instigate it.

to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but 
also to decrease it (if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous 
amendment).  I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can 
decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release 
procedures.   However, the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything & 
doesn't give NMNG any rights, since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by 
mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity).  Since it does not 
seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff, 
I think I would recommend we omit it.  However, NMNG might insist on this or 
similar language to reflect the "deal" --- or at least the conversations of 
the parties.  If that's the case, I suppose I would advise the marketing 
folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and 
explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release.  Comments?

FYI. In general everything went ok today Nov 10.

Susan Scott had some problems with some of the excel spreadsheets she's been 
running on her machine. The issue here is that the CopyFromRecordset method 
of a range object is failing. The simple
fix is to use a user defined function named rsOutput instead of the method. 
She also mentioned that a process that outputs a text file to the E: drive 
seems to be failing on her machine but is working fine on Dutch Quigley's 
machine. She'll provide more detail to support on Monday.

Cheers.

Agustin,

I am trying to confirm the counterparty on one of your deals so that it can 
be properly assigned in TAGG.  The ticket for the deal in question reads 
Barcel Mexico.  However, I spoke recently with Beatrice Reyna who informed me 
that you believed the counterparty to be one of the Bimbo companies.  If you 
wouldn't mind looking into this and getting back to me with the correct 
counterparty name it would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
Susan

Thanks for the attached deal information, Shouan.  Looking at the data I feel 
confident that, once we are past the first day of the month, the gas daily 
options curveshift is valuing correctly.  However, I am still concerned with 
the valuation from 10/31.  Is there anyway to see same breakdown on 11/2 and 
11/3 for 10/31's position.  If you could send me that information in the same 
format I think we may have an answer for the changed deal value we saw fall 
out of my trader's book on 11/1.

Hey Kyle,

You'll be happy to know that I think I finally caught up on all of the sleep 
I've been missing out on of late.  Last week was extremely trying at work, I 
think I probably put in a good 70-75 hrs. between Monday and Friday, and thus 
resulted in me being a complete and total vegetable this weekend.  Anyway, 
I'm assuming you've been trying to relax as well and have some fun before 
embarking on your new career with Valero.  I'm sure your decision to leave 
Enron and move back to San Antonio will prove to be the right one.    

In regards to dinner this Friday...I would definitely like to get together 
before you leave.  Given how I've been feeling on Friday evenings as of late 
(monumentally exhausted), sometime earlier in the week might be better.  
However, if Friday's the only time you can do it then Friday it is.  Just let 
me know what works for you.  Of course, regardless of what night it is, it's 
probably going to have to be on the later side to accommodate Larry's lackey 
(i.e. me).

Thanks for the update.  I have been given a green light as well to go ahead 
and start testing my traders deals.  Let me know if you just need TAGG deal

Thanks, 
Susan ScottJessica,

I'm sorry I never got in touch with you last weekend, but I had the wrong 
phone number with me and didn't have enough brain power to think of using 
Information.  I don't think I would have been much fun anyway since I pretty 
much just ended up sleeping the whole weekend.  In fact, I fell asleep in the 
car on the ride back to my sister's house after the game and my parents 
decided to just leave me in the car.  I think I was probably out there for an 
hour before I woke up (needless to say I was very confused).  Anyway, hope 
things are going well for you and Clay.  I know everything must be kind of 
crazy for both of you right now with finals coming up and all of the 
interviewing you've both no doubt been doing. 

I really want to get a chance to see you and chat...I don't feel like we've 
had a good one in forever.  I will be in Austin over Thanksgiving for the 
game, so we could try to touch base then if you're going to be in town.  If 
not, I'm sure I can manage at least one weekend trip during December if 
there's a good weekend for you.  Just drop me  a line when you get a chance 
and let me know what's new with you.

The attached document shows my proposed changes to Universal's agreement in 
redlining.  I tried not to over-lawyer or make this overly complicated, but 
in my view this needed a lot of basic cleanup.  Many of my changes are simply 
to make the language more accurate (for example, in the use of defined 
terms).  

In a couple of places, I have questions:  1) In the second opening paragraph, 
I don't know whether it is possible to attach the Proposal as an exhibit; if 
not, ignore my change.  2) Section 4.a.  -- their provision for an adjustment 
seemed a little unusual to me but it could work in favor of either party, so 
I left it in.  If you don't like it, let me know.  3)  In Section 5, I just 
tried to simplify the billing procedure in case of termination.  Let me know 
if this does not agree with your intent.

Please call me with your comments, and let me know how you would like to 
proceed.

Thanks.  As for getting talked into buying all the extras, I'm not as easily 
convinced of things as some people I know ( Cow fingers?).  Halloween at the 
Big E wasn't nearly as fun as I'd hoped...I mean, they keep the candy in 
machines and you have to actually pay for it...that just borders on cruel.

By the way,  you'll have to question  the college coaches and sports writers 
out there if you have any issues with the rankings.  I am merely the

That is weird.  I received your first message.  

Dave, Exhibit A of the O&M agreement is a description of the Compressor Motor 
Facilities.  Do you have this?
Exhibit C is insurance coverages; I assume I need to get that from Nemec.

Martha, please send me by interoffice mail copies of the executed documents 
Drew has; mine seem to have vaporized.

Thank you!

Subject: Transwestern Contracts

You guys probably don't remember this (I didn't until I checked the file) but 
there were a couple of exhibits to the Transwestern Gallup contracts that we 
left to be attached to the final contracts after execution.  My recollection 
is that we were in such a hurry to get the Compression Service Agreement 
signed and sent to FERC that we left a couple of these things to do later.  
Now that we have the FERC order, I want to get these contracts off my desk 
and off to Corporate Records or whereever original contracts go to die.   On 
my originals, I'm missing Exhibit B to the CSA (which is the CDEC Rate 
Schedule No. 21),  and Exhibits A and C to the O&M Agreement.  

Susan, please coordinate with Gerald to get these exhibits in our respective 
files and we can send these contracts off to the central rathole and be done 
with it.  Thanks to you all.  DF

I want you to know how much getting your email today meant to me.  I was

bit on the rough side.  I will continue my thoughts tomorrow when I have more 
time to gather them, but until then I wanted you to know that I did get the 
email and that it contained quite possibly some of the kindest and most 
touching things ever said to me.  And, please know that you would never, ever 
be put in one of my stalker catagories...you could never be lumped in any 
catagory with the SP's of the world.

Susan

As for the good-bye, I would have to give it high marks as well.Hey,

Quick question, I was hoping to go get my car detailed this weekend and I 
remembered that you had your truck detailed a while back...I was wondering 
where you had it done and if you thought they did a good job ( I'm assuming 
the place is pretty close to our area of town).  I finally got into the 
parking garage and have decided I now have real incentive to keep my car 
looking nice.

Hope things are well with you.  I talked to Darren last week and it sounds as 
though he is extremely busy these days.  I'm guessing the story's much the 
same with you - a far cry from the listless days you two spent in Net Works.  
Anyway, if you could let me know about the detailing I would appreciate it.

Susan

By the way, since there's no telling if I'll have the opportunity to gloat 
two weeks from now (Tech in Lubbock is never a safe bet) - and while neither 
season has been one for the record books (except of course for our loss to OU 
- one of the worst in history) - I noticed that unlike the Longhorns, your 
beloved Bruins are conspicuously absent from the top 25.  Oh well, c'est la 
vie.Don't know when you'll get a chance to read this, but I must confess it made 
me a bit teary eyed.  I didn't think he had it in him to be so eloquent.

As for New Year's Eve, I have to say I'm kind of with Kasey.  As much as I'd 
love to see Gary P., I don't really want to risk the drive and I'm guessing 
no one else does either. 

Hope you had a good weekend and I'll talk to you soon.

Sue

Hey, how was the weekend?  Did you at least catch up a little on your rest?
You had one heck of a week but then again I guess that is just old hat for
you.  We had a good time on Saturday.  It is always fun to be on sixth
street close to halloween, even more freaks come out.

OK enough stalling.  I just thought something needed to be said about
wednesday.  We could just go on and act like nothing happened and probably
never see or talk to one another ever again.  I don't like that solution.
My personality is to go with the flow but by doing this you sometimes miss
out on opportunities.  So the traditional me would say it was just one night
and didn't really mean anything, which could possibly be true.  One thing
that I learned from you is that you have to take chances and don't be
intimidated.  You have a very strong personality and I can see where
somebody could easily be intimidated.  Along with that comes someone who is
smart, attractive, outgoing, and somebody who can fit in anywhere, whether
your at the local honky-tonk or at some gala.  The one thing I know about
you is that your going to be successful and I don't mean in the monetary way
because I know that isn't high on the priority list.  I also know that if I
would have never left the company then I probably wouldn't be sitting here
writing this email.

When I was thinking about leaving I didn't think it was going to be that
hard.  I really didn't like the way my life was going and I knew I needed a
change.  Then I sit back and think of all the things I'm going to miss.
People bad talk risk all the time, with the long hours and little respect
you sometimes get it is understandable.  The thing I'm going to miss the
most are all the friendships I have built working in that group.  Sometimes
the toughest times are when you really get to know someone.  But the hardest
thing now is that I will not be around you.  I know that sounds really bad
but the honest truth is I have liked you ever since we started sitting next
to each other.  We had this chemistry and it made the job a little easier
knowing you were there.  I really think the best times I had in Houston were
those couple of weeks we went out after work to have a few drinks.  I also
knew that since we worked together that it probably wasn't the best thing to
get involved.  I really regret that decision right about now.

Alright I guess I have said a lot of sappy stuff and you should know that
I'm not usually like this, which is probably why I didn't call you to share
this info.  I do think some things need to be said or else the other person
will never know.  You are a great person and even though the chips are
stacked against me I needed to let you know this.  I understand that your
under a lot of stress right now and by no means do I want to add on.  The
one thing I wish you would take away from this is that if your 35 and still
looking then you need not look any further.

So I apologize for using this forum to express this I really wanted to talk
to you in person on Friday but I just didn't get a chance much less know
where to start. I hope we stay in touch and if you ever want to go to Gruene
Hall then let me know.  I also don't want to be put in one of your stalker
categories so take this for whatever you want, please don't think of me as
the next SP.

Take care and have a good week.

Kyle

By the way I think that good-bye would have to rank in top of all times, at
least it is number one in my book.

The Post-Ted Susan is out of control.  In less than a week's time I have 
mugged down with 3 guys and have a fourth one emailing me to go out 
sometime.  Funny thing is I'm not really interested in any of them, just 
having fun.  Hope all well with you.

SusanNo need to apologize for keeping me out Wednesday night, it was probably more 
a case of me keeping myself out (I have been known to do that on occasion).  
I'm sorry I didn't return your call yesterday, but I had a pretty crazy day 
here and that mixed with me only running on about two cylinders effectively 
cut me off from the outside world.  As for being upset about anything, don't 
worry I'm not.  You know me well enough to know that my actions are my own.  
I'm not sure if I'm going to stay in Austin Saturday night or not, but in 
case I do my cell # is 281-844-0866.  

Susan

I'll see you at Purvi's happy hour if you end up going.

Since you may or may not return my call I thought I would shoot you an
email.  I'm sorry for keeping you out soo late on Wednesday and anything
else that you may be upset about.  Anyway I will be in Austin on Saturday
night and was hoping we could meet up.  The only thing is I have no way of
getting a hold of you.  So, here is my cell number and I should at least
have this until the end of November:  281-216-5005.  I already got Vic's and
Trey's number so maybe we can all hook up on sixth street.  You can always
respond to this or give me a call with your number.  I may swing by Purvi's
happy hour tonight so maybe I'll see you there.

By the way I have never been married and I'm not 28 yet.

Christine and I seem to have gotten Phillips interested in a right to 
terminate if TW's minimum tariff rate ever exceeds the contract rate.  They 
said they would mull it over, at least.

But what they really would prefer to have is a provision in which they would 
get the contract rate no matter what.  Since this would make it a negotiated 
rate deal from day 1, I feel like I need to get your buy-in before we agree 
to it.  Steve has already told me it is OK with him.  Please advise.It's muster - to pass inspection...(how does mustard make sense?  It's not

I really miss football--I'm jealous for that.  Is is pass mustard or muster?  
You're right--tough cookie, who deserves a good man.  I'll screen for you.  
20 questions on short call as needed (provided that the info from friends 
thing didn't apply to me....).  Actually I was just developing a social 
circle there and whammo....I'm here.  I figure I'm here to kick some tail and 
worry about the social element later.  Don't get me wrong, I am drinking on 
the w/e's.  Unfortunately I am not meeting the TX & CA women type.  I got no 
Euro-rap....

Been talking to Wilson?  I have been AOL-IMing him.  He seems okay as 
usual--women the same, work on the up with a new boss.  That's all for now.  
Getting sick.  Think I will go home early tonight (relative).  Talk to you 
soon!  

--Darren

Your welcome.  

As for myself, I'm doing pretty good these days.  I've been up in Austin 
practically every weekend for the games and have actually been managing to go 
out a bit more here in Houston during the week in an effort to become social 
again.  There isn't too much new in Tejas...the weather's still warm and a 
bit on the muggy side, but what can you expect it's only almost November.  
Today is Wednesday, so of course Steak Night is on the agenda for this 
evening.  Actually, the guy who trained me for my current job is leaving 
Enron and his happy hour just happens to be at Little Woodrow's tonight - how 
convenient.  On the man front, I've put myself back out on the "market" so to 
speak and have a couple of pursuant suitors right now (although, I don't know 
that in the end any of them will pass muster).  Unfortunately for them I am 
somewhat sceptical of guys in general these days (especially ones that I 
can't get background information on through friends), but I'm trying not to 
let that color my opinion too much.  Not to worry about your former neighbor 
either, I haven't seen or talked to him in a couple of weeks and that's okay 
with me.

Drop me a line when you get the chance,
Susan

Yes, the deal would have been for today.  I'm not sure who the trader was and 
Larry has already left for the day.  I will probably just leave a note for 
him with his packet and resolve the issue tomorrow.

Here's the summary we sent you before, with new reference to Hector in 
redlining.  Call Jeff (713-853-1521) or me (713-853-0596) if you have 
questions.  
Thought you'd get a kick out of this one.  By the way, did you guys end up 
doing the "holiday greeting" thing?

You'll like this one.

I'll have the time to write you a longer letter in a couple of days.

I was just wondering if there was any more information available regarding 
the upcoming Super Saturday events.  I would be glad to help out in any 
capacity.

Thanks,
SusanMarcelo,

Evidently, there has been some discussion regarding the use of Enpower for 
Natural Gas basis options.  As a result I've been advised to hold off on any 
meetings until further notice.  Thanks again for all of your help and I will 
be in touch with you as soon as I know how we are going to progress.

Deal # Q52317 - 

The counterparty is Nylon de Mexico and the contact is Alberto Diosdado.  The 
originator on the deal is Agustin Perez.    For October 19: Put the obsession and dedication back into your job,
                     health, and daily life. Stressful matters beyond your 
control have leached away
                     much of the excitement that makes life enjoyable. Use 
this Mercury retro
                     period to reinvent your work philosophy and improve your 
health and lifestyle.
                     The resources and relief you seek are available, but you 
may be expected to
                     kowtow and kiss butt to get what you need. Are you 
willing -- or not? I can't
                     blame you if your high standards won't allow anything to 
compromise your
                     vision. But if you're feeling pragmatic, use the next 3 
weeks to cook up an
                     agreement you can live with. Looks good.

Thanks for the heads-up,
SusanI just got the email from our UT recruiter naming all of the Super Saturday 
candidates.  Kudos.  I'm so glad we didn't embarrass ourselves by overlooking 
you a second time.  I'll see what I can do about getting assigned to your

-----------------
Good afternoon.  I'm Al Gore, and I'd like to tell you about myself.
I know a lot about hardship, because I came into this world as a poor
black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of Tennessee.  I was born in
a log cabin that I built with my own hands.  I taught myself to read by
candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working
summers as a deck hand on a Mississippi River steamboat.

My mother taught me the value of education, so every day I would walk 5
miles to a one-room schoolhouse.  I was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp,
thought I never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve
as the inspiration for "Huckleberry Finn."

Back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens.
One day, a traveling minister came through town, and I asked him if
anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee civil rights for all
Americans.  Well, I guess I made an impression.  You see, the minister's
name was Martin Luther King, Jr.

My father was a United States Senator.  He once perched me on his knee
and said, "Son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you
can live in a hotel in Washington, D.C., and go to an exclusive prep
school."

But life of privilege was not for me.  After getting my high school
diploma, I took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill.  I was so appalled
at the treatment of the workers there that I organized a union.
Later, that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my
close friends at the AFL-CIO call me "Norma Rae."

When word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, Harvard
called and offered me a scholarship.  I captained the hockey team to
four consecutive national championships, but I also played football and
was good enough to win the Heisman Trophy.  During my college years, I
lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing lead guitar for a
little rock band.  You may have heard of it -- the Rolling Stones.

But there was a war going on, and I felt I had to serve my country.  So
I enlisted in the U.  S.  Army and went to Vietnam.  I was deeply
opposed to the war, but I did my duty as a soldier and came back home
with the Medal of Honor and the Croix de Guerre.

When I got back, I took a long journey across this great land of ours.
I've crossed the deserts bare, man, I've breathed the mountain air, man,
I've traveled, I've done my share, man, I've been everywhere.
And the people I met at truckstops and campgrounds and homeless shelters
on that journey all said the same thing: "Al, we need you in
Washington."

I knew they were right, but first I had to take care of some other
business---building the World Trade Center, founding the Audubon
Society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer,
and coming up with the recipe for Mrs.  Field's chocolate chip cookies.

Finally, I deferred to the demands of the people of Tennessee and
allowed them to elect me to the House of Representatives and the Senate,
where I established the US Strategic Oil Reserve.  And then one winter
day nearly nine years ago, for no particular reason, I answered the call
of the people once again and took the oath of office as Vice President
of the United States.

Since then, I've been part of the most successful administration in
American history.  And, in my spare time, I invented the Internet.
Many times Bill Clinton has been pondering some grave decision and has
asked me what to do.  And when I would give him my thoughts, he would
invariable say, "Of course.  That's brilliant.  Why didn't I think of
that?" During the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the president
told me he only wished he had listened when I told him to stay away form
that dark-haired intern.

So after I decided to run for president, I sat down with him and asked
if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign.
And Bill Clinton gave me a few simple words of advice -- words I'll
never forget.  He looked me in the eye and he said, "Al, just tell the
truth, it's always worked for me."




Just thought you'd like to know that Roger Ebert gave the movie 3 stars.  He 
had many of the same comments to make about the film and Dallas as you.

Talk to you soon,
SusanMary Kay and Drew, please see Christine's message below.  This language is 
very similar to language that NNG has used to address the change-in-rates 
issue.  I do not believe it creates a negotiated rates issue.  Please let me 
know as soon as possible if you have any concerns.  It is important that we 
work something out with Phillips today.

By the way, I asked Christine if she had asked Phillips to 1) give up their 
right of first refusal and 2) agree to our new capacity release language 
(i.e. TW gets the upside if capacity is released at a higher rate) in 
exchange for us making this compromise.  She feels that it would be 
inappropriate to ask them because the language below does not quite give 
Phillips what they had requested originally (that is, a negotiated rate).

Subject: Additional Phillips Language

Susan - Here is the language that Phillips has requested.  They liked and had 
requested the exact wording inserted into their agreement, so if there any 
any changes that you feel needs to be made, please try to keep the changes as 
simple as possible.  Thanks!

In the event that Transwestern's minimum tariff rate is increased to a level

renegotiate the discount to achieve the same economic value to both parties.
You need to give me your messenger address so we can "talk".Those were great Chris.  Sorry no emails sooner to tell you all of my trip to 
London, which was incredible, but alas I am back at work and therefore 
swamped.  Mom said you guys had a great time in China.  I hope you took lots 
of pictures.  I'm not sure if she already passed along the bad news, but it 
doesn't look like I'm going to be able to visit next month...Work strikes 
again.  I am very frustrated (considering I asked for this time off 4 mos. 
ago) but there isn't really anything I can do.  So, I'm going to see if 
there's a way I could come over next spring.  Regardless, I very excited 
about you and Chuck coming back to Houston in December and we'll just have to 
make up some quality time then.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

PS - Isn't it ironic...Now Ben keeps calling wanting to go out.  I mean 
honestly what goes through these guys heads.  They don't realize a "good 
thing" the first time around and the second time around is too late - the 
"good thing" is no longer interested.I am definitely interested in the parking space at the Met.  Please let me 
know if it is still possible for me to acquire a space.

Thanks,
Susan ScottThanksHey Em,

Well it's 8:30 Friday night and surprise I'm still at the office.  I love 
this place!!!  To answer your question, yes I am definitely suffering 
withdrawal.  I will be working very hard over the next few months to cure 
that though.  Nothing really exciting to report here except A) Nick called me 
my first day back in the office to make sure I arrived home safely ( I really 
don't know what to do about all of that)  B) Ben keeps calling me to see if I 
want to go out - 2 nights in a row in addition to our Steak Night beer (I 
haven't gone either night).  How ironic is all of this?  I've got one guy 
worrying and thinking of me that I care nothing for...I've got another guy 
who I at one time cared for but no longer do trying to take advantage of my 
vulnerable state (which in truth isn't really vulnerable at all) and another 
guy, who I until fairly recently cared for, who I think could go the rest of 
his life without ever seeing/speaking to me again (Or course I guess the 
reverse of that is true as well).

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Positive notes:  I think Ted is getting greying and losing hair with the 
added stress of corn trading.  He looks old and pitiful.

Glad to hear things are going so well.  No, I haven't spoken with Ted since 
my return...but, I did go out a few of the nights I was in London with an 
undergrad/grad school friend of his (among other people of course).  
Surprise, surprise he didn't have many supportive words for Ted as dating 
material either.  In summary he found Ted to lack attentiveness to his 
partners and maybe even fidelity.  He said the break up of Ted's marriage 
wasn't "ALL his fault", which is a decidedly different slant than the one Ted 
gave me the night of our chat.  I also heard that he has worked his way 
around Enron a bit.  All in all very disheartening information.  Regardless, 
I'm still glad I dated him and think I learned a lot from the whole 
situation.  Tell Brendan I said, "Hello" and good luck with the new role at 
work.

Susan

I have a hold on travel plans to Korea right now as work may interfere.  Oh, 
well.You guys are going to kill me, but I just got a ticket on the floor for the 
Rockets game tonight.  I was hoping I could get cell phone numbers from a few 
of you so that I could maybe meet up with y'all after the game.  I definitely 
want to see everyone and could "go out" later if anyone's interested.

Dear Citizens' Assistance Division:

I live in the Houston Heights on the 800 block of Cortlandt.  For the 3 years 
I've lived 
there, the drainage ditch in front of my house, and several other houses on 
my street, 
have been blocked.  Any time it rains, we have standing water for several 
days 
afterwards.  I know that other streets in the Heights have the same problem.  
I have 
heard that because of the mild winter we're having, we can expect a bumper 
crop of 
mosquitos this summer.  Standing water therefore poses a health concern for 
residents 
of the Heights this summer. 

Does the City have any current plans to fix the drainage problem in the 
Heights?  Last 
year I called and requested that the ditch in front of my house be cleared, 
but got no 
response.  I hope that this was merely an oversight rather than an indication 
that the City 
of Houston has no regard for the health and comfort of its citizens. 

Any information you can provide would be appreciated. 

Sincerely, 

Susan Scott 
815 Cortlandt St. 
(713) 853-0596 (daytime phone)

Hey Julie,

I just got back from London Tuesday and am now almost fully recovered from 
the jet lag.  I had an absolutely incredible time while I was over there and 
was even able to go into the Enron office for a while.  One of the guys I 
knew here in Houston even set up an impromptu interview for me while I was 
there so I think my working over there may be a very real possibility.  Since 
I'd already done a lot of the touristy things the last time I was in London 
Emily and I pretty much just hung out.  We went out to eat Friday night and 
then to a club ( I think we got home around 4 am after indulging in some fish 
and chips).  Saturday and Sunday we mostly just wondered around the city to 
various shops and markets and went out to various lunch and dinner venues.  
Finally, on Monday I went in to the office while Em was at school and then 
had a fairly big last night in town with some friends of Emily's.  Hope 
everything's been going well with you and that the move into your new place 
was a success.  I'll keep checking for great fares out to SD...I'd love to 
meet your roommate and all of your other friends I feel as though I know now.

Susan

PS - I think you're right about the California men.  I am currently in 
contact with about three of them and they all have issues.  Although, I still 
think Ted takes the cake. Jeremy,

I saved the file so that the tab you open it up on is Larry's Gas Daily 
Option model.
Em, you know I'm in on this one.  It's been far too long since we've had a 
true NB weekend.  Unfortunately (although not surprisingly) it appears our 
erstwhile friend Alan will claim any excuse, no matter how unappealing, to 
avoid singing show tunes around the camp fire - your voice will be missed.  
For the rest of you guys, I hope we can muster a good turn-out as I am in 
desperate need of over analysis in regards to the problems of the world as 
well as ourselves whilst in a drunken stupor.  Nobody does it better...

Susan

ok- i'm going to remain skeptical and cautious about this til i get more
feedback (yes, kk, i know where you stand!)  who is interested in spending
this new years in NB @ the river and going to gruene hall?  need to commit
fairly soon, as there have been 'bites' from other interested parties, and
we'll just rent it out if interest is low.....those who haven't responded,
pls drop me a line, make suggestions.....can't have TOO many people due to
size restrictions, but obviously significant others/spouses are welcome.  am
sure i'm forgetting a key person or 2 from this email- let me know who!
don't want to hurt feelings (you KNOW how sensitive I am....)but want to
make sure we have a 'cohesive' group.  keep me posted.....au revoir from the
land of bangers and mash....

Hey guys,

Well I'm back home in Houston looking out at our lovely skyline (okay, maybe 
it's not that lovely but it is sunny here).  Anyway, I'm so glad I got the 
chance to see all of you while I was in London.  It seemed as though all of 
you are really enjoying your time in the UK - which is good to hear given the 
fact I'm hoping to make it over there myself.  Hope the approaching close to 
2000 finds everyone in good spirits.

Cheers,
Susan Hey Darren,

Just wanted to say thanks again for including Em and I in the outing Friday 
night and joining us for dinner Monday.  Hope things with work are going well 
and that you're managing to reinvent the wheel without too many problems.  

Cheers,
Susan


"The game of life is a game of boomerangs. Our thoughts, deeds and words 
return to us sooner or later with astounding
 accuracy." -- Florence Scovel ShinnAshley,

I am so sorry we never managed to meet up while I was in London.  Emily and I 
spent all day Sunday gallivanting around the city to the markets, etc. and 
Monday I ended-up spending a lot longer than I planned at the office.  On the 
bright side, I was able to have an impromptu interview and meet quite a few 
people while I was there.  I'm hoping to be over there and gainfully employed 
by early next spring.  Hope things are well with you and the next trip I make 
over there we will definitely get together.

SusanTrip was excellent.  I took pictures, but most of them where taken inside 
pubs so who knows how they'll turn out.  I definitely thought about you and 
how much you would love the area Emily's living in (very upscale, English and 
proper).  I also had an impromptu interview thanks to Dave Oliver so we'll 
see.  I will talk to you more later as I am in the thick of calcing and am 
suffering a bit of jet lag.

Susan

Dear Mr. Henderson:

Attached pursuant to Dave Foti's request is the Substation Maintenance 
Agreement in Word format with Transwestern's proposed changes shown in 
redlining.  After you've had a chance to review the agreement, please feel 
free to contact me with any questions or comments.

Sincerely,

Susan Scott
Counsel for Transwestern Pipeline Company

sscott3@enron.com

Here you go Cynthia.  I feel pretty confident that everything is correct this 
month.  However, I'm sure I'm being overly optimistic on that front so call 
or email me with any changes.

Hey guys,

Just wanted to drop a line and let you know that I'm going to be visiting 
London over the next 5 days or so.  I'm planning on swinging by the offices 
Monday morning to see everyone and just wanted to foreworn you all.  
Hopefully, I'll get a chance to see you then.

Susan

If anyone wants to get a hold of me you can leave a message on my friend 
Emily's phone 020 7243 5453.Lexi,

I completely forgot to turn in my expense report from last months recruiting 
trip.  Things around here have been absolutely crazy, as I'm sure they have 
been for you.  In addition to the attached file below I am forwarding the 
hard copy to your office.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to 
help with the process.

Here's the address for you.Agustin, 

I haven't booked the origination we talked about yet because I wanted to get 
an exact number from you first.  If you could send me an email with the 
correct origination amount I can book it tonight.  The deal was with General 
de Cermica for 11,000/month 10/1/00 - 03/31/0.

Thanks,
SusanHey,

Thanks for the well wishes.  I don't actually leave until Thursday, but I am 
VERY ready and equally excited.  I ended up meeting Ted for dinner Thursday 
to "chat".  He definitely doesn't deserve the title of Wonder Boy.  Anyway, 
I'll forward you the email I sent Emily regarding the evening in question.  
Hope everything's good with you.

Well, we met and had dinner last night.  NOTHING of importance was discussed 
during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were 
leaving that any actual talking occurred.  Here are the basics...

- There is definitely no "us" anymore...and I quote "sometimes these things 
just fade out"
- There is much I didn't know about him and I am sure even more that I still 
don't
- Case in point...He was MARRIED before (yes, you read correctly married)
- Turns out he's been divorced about three years, it didn't end well and he 
hasn't had a relationship that has lasted beyond       2 mos. in those three 
years (even though, by his own admission, he has dated a lot) - Can you say 
issues?
- He told me "I know this sounds so trite, but this really has nothing to do 
with you, it's all me."  Of course I agreed with him saying "I know it's you 
Ted, I don't have any problems." (He got a chuckle out of that one)
- I told him about my frustrations and disappointment with how he had handled 
things and he apologised (evidently Kevin told him about our exchange at 
Steak Night) and I also let him know how much I appreciated his handling of 
things in the beginning
- I said I really hated animosity and hard feelings and that as long as he 
hadn't done anything truly horrible to me (i.e. murder a family member, etc.) 
I would really like to leave things on a good note...He agreed.
- He said I was a fantastic girl and that he still enjoyed hanging out and 
talking with me (although I don't see us doing a lot of that)

So all in all I walked away with three very important things 1. A lightened 
load (I got everything of my chest that I wanted to and needed to) 2. My 
dignity (I handled it just as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A 
clearer since of Ted as a person (He definitely has a lot of issues in his 
life he has not completely dealt with yet, and who knows if he ever will?)

Anyway, I'm okay with everything and surprisingly feel pretty good.  I'll 
talk to you soon.

Susan

By the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and 
maybe just a little harsh)I am very excited about my trip to London.  For one thing I get to visit 
Emily, but at this point more importantly I don't have to think about work 
for 6 days straight.  You guys are going to have a great trip to China and I 
say if you find a rug that you really like (i.e. you're not just getting one 
because you think you should) you should definitely get it.  Just think what 
a great conversation piece it would make over the years.  

And don't worry about my appetite for travel getting spoiled...that is 
impossible.  I can't wait to see you guys.  I think that you being in Korea 
and Emily being in London has made this whole Ted situation that much harder 
to deal with.  I've realized how much I appreciate y'alls insights now that 
they aren't as easy to get.

Love ya,
SusanDo you know where the Texas Exes watch the games in London?  It might be kind 
of fun to watch the OU game somewhere...even if just for a bit of it.  Just a 
thought.I always forget what the time difference is so I thought I might be able to 
catch you "real time."  

I went to the game Saturday with Travis, Corey, Mike and a friend of his.  
Kathy was getting her certification for spinning classes and thus I was given 
the responsibility of baby-sitting Corey and Travis.  Anyway, Trav's pledge 
class had a reunion at the house after the game and I think it may have 
single-handedly cured me of wanting men in their early thirties.  The single 
guys from their class are definitely still single for a reason.  Also, you've 
gotta tell Chuck that Kinzer's date for the game was a year younger than me 
(although I will say, after meeting her, you would've thought she was much 
younger).  I think 27-28 may be a better range.  Old enough to know who they 
are and what they want, but still young enough to explain their unattached 
status on career focus.

Talk to you soon,
SusanDrew, what is BNSF?John Buchanan and I discussed TW's transfer of gas from the PG&E/Topock 
receipt/delivery point to the PG&E/Topock Park N' Ride point to implement 
TW's use of PG&E's Market Center service.  My understanding is that 
physically the points are one and the same, and that the transaction will 
simply be a paper transfer.  Since a contract is required in our system as a 
formality to implement the transfer, the rate TW will "charge" itself for the 
transfer is $0.  

This message is to confirm that I see no legal or regulatory problems with 
the above scenario.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail or call 
me (x30596).
Sorry I never called yesterday...I had turned my phone off and didn't realize 
you'd called until last night.  I'm still at work right now and therefore am 
extremely tired.  Hope you got everything you needed to accomplished this 
weekend.  I had a good time at the game and, thanks to Travis's pledge class 
reunion, have come to the conclusion that 27-28 is a better age range for 
me.  There young enough to excuse being single due to career focus and still 
old enough to know who they are and what they want.  Some critical things 
happen in those 3-5 years from a man's late twenties to early thirties that 
can expose so many "issues" (examples of which I got to see several of on 
Saturday).

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Are you and Doug going to OU?Hey,

It's 8:30 and I'm still at work.  Did I mention I really need this vacation?  
Anyway, I have a couple of questions for you.  Is there anything special 
you'd like me to bring over (that your Mom isn't getting for you).  I talked 
to your Mom yesterday and she mentioned a craving for Turkey Jerky.  If you 
want me to bring some over just let me know where to buy it.  Also, do you 
have any predictions for the weather.  I'm planning on bringing the following 
- jeans, sweatshirt, black pants & skirt, black cardigan, "rain coat" (I put 
it in quotes b/c I know mine won't be official), some "go out" close, running 
shoes, heels, and boots, 2 sweaters, varying tops, and a pair of shorts.  I 
always end up over-packing, but I'm really going to try to pare down.  I'm 
assuming you have a blow-dryer so I can leave mine at home. 

I talked to Darren today and he said Friday sounded good...and, I sent an 
email to Nick so hopefully it will work for him as well.  I also emailed 
Jessica's friend Ashley who's living over there and she wanted to get 
together maybe for lunch or something over the weekend. 

I've been checking out the Tube Maps on the Web and don't think I should have 
much of a problem getting to your place.  I assume I'm going to want to get 
off at the Holland Park tube stop.  Should be a piece of cake, right?

Any bright ideas of how to get your extra set of keys to me Friday morning?  
I guess there isn't really anywhere for you to hide them around your flat 
(i.e. under the doormat or over the door frame?).  

See you soon,
Susan

- I may have to pump Darren for a little bit of info Friday night (subtly of 
course)...Like did he know that I didn't know about Ted's "past" - maybe you 
can find out why the marriage ended.Shelly,

Is there any way you could give me a little more information regarding the 
times of the presentations for each of the respective schools.

Thanks,
Susan

Hey Ashley,

Just thought I'd drop you a line to let you know that I will be in London 
this Friday through next Tuesday.  I'm visiting a friend of mine who is 
attending Sotheby's graduate program.  I know it's short notice, but I would 
love to see you at some point while I'm over there.  If you get a chance 
email me back and let me know if you're free any of those days and how I can 
get a hold of you while I'm over there.  Hope all is well.

SusanEverything goes O.K.  I met with Ted last week for dinner Thursday night...it 
was VERY enlightening.  I'll forward you the email I sent to my sister-in-law 
(it sums everything up pretty well).  Let me know if you want to grab coffee, 
a drink, etc. tonight or tomorrow night - although I think you've got NCL 
tomorrow.  

Well, we met and had dinner last night.  NOTHING of importance was discussed 
during our entire meal and it was only when I brought things up as we were 
leaving that any actual "talking" occurred.  Here are the basics...

healthy for me)

dignity (I handled just it as I'd hoped...with composure and wit) 3. A

completely)

talk to you soon.

Susan

By the way, I told him about the shirt idea (he thought it was funny, and 
maybe just a little harsh)

Talk to you soon, Jen.I think an original tasters gathering is a great idea...unfortunately, I'm 
going to be out of town Thursday (I'm visiting my friend Emily in London and 
I have to admit I am very excited).  If you guys do end up going have a great 
time.

Susan

So I met him for dinner Thursday night.  Nothing was discussed until we were 
about to leave and I couldn't hold my tongue any longer.  Turns out he was 
married before and may have some issues (pretty big ones in my opinion - case 
in point, he's been divorced three years and, by his own admission, has dated 
quite a bit in the interim but nothing that has lasted longer than 2 mos. - 
sounds like a pattern to me). 

 We'll talk more later,

Hey Darren,

I wanted to try and touch and base with you before my arrival in London.  I 
talked to Emily late last week and she seemed to think Friday night was a 
good night to try and get together.  I know you have a bunch of people that 
are going to be in London this weekend, but maybe we could just make it one 
big group outing.  Get back to me when you get a chance and we'll try and set 
something up.

SusanNo one has ever mistaken me for being a shy or timid person...least of all
Ted.  Therefore, telling him about the shirt was right in character for me.
I think a part of him probably felt a little ashamed that a 23 yr. old girl
with almost no dating experience could handle the situation with more class
than him.  Anyway, there were a few other things established and solidified
last night by Ted - 1. By his own admission, I am definitely smarted than
him (while in the past I have challenged that I had to agree last night) 2.
I am a confident, probably too much so, and well-adjusted individual.
Merely taking into account those two points, Ted in his present "condition"
could never be a match for me.  I would either always feel like I was
carrying him or rolling over him.  I'm still absolutely floored by the fact
I have now dated a divorcee.  Does Chuck think less of me for being duped?
I hope not...he really seemed like a good (to everyone that met him).

I think Mom, Dad and I are all going to fly over on the same flight
(Singapore Airlines).  I found a great deal from San Francisco for around
$580.  I of course will have to fly from Houston which ups the fare to
$800, but it's still the best deal around.  I can't wait to see you guys.

SusanSpoke with Steve about the swap question.  He wants to talk with you about 
this before circling back to Knippa.  If you don't hear from him, and want to 
call him, his # is 281-350-8441.

Re. TW's exposure if we authorize ECS to lock in too early:

If TW defaults under the CSA, it must hold ECS harmless with regard to 
expenses incurred by ECS in the assignment of the electric supply agreement 
and pay ECS whatever is owed under the agreement.  No other specific damages 
are addressed, and the agreement specifically prohibits the recovery of 
consequential, incidental or indirect losses or damages.  (Section 9.2 
provides for reimbursement for ECS's reasonable costs in providing 
Compression Services, but only in the event TW uses its FERC out.)  The Gas 
Conversion Agreement provides for termination of the agreement in the event 
of default by TW under the CSA, and obligates TW to reimburse ECS for ECS's 
costs and expenses incurred in unwinding the forward sale of natural gas 
volumes to be delivered to ECS under the agreement.  

Other questions -- let  me know.No one has ever mistaken me for being a shy or timid person...least of all

Subject: the weirdo has shown his true colors finally, and not just by e mail


First of all sorry about the "overjealous" not
"overzealous" in my last e mail--it was late.

Anyway, to the important stuff...I think that's the
problem with dating 30 something guys who aren't
married.  Either a divorce in the past or too many
other hang ups (and this guy looks like he fits into
both categories).  I know that everyone says that, but
in my observation it has been true.  So you're stuck
between a rock and a hard place.  You want the
maturity level of someone like him, but sometimes
those older men are too much of a headache.  I'm glad
you at least got to say your toughts.  I can't believe
you told him about the t-shirt!  Oh well, what did you
have to lose by getting it all out there.  I'm glad
your questions are answered now.  I guess there really
wasn't anything he could say to fix things between you
guys!  I guess you'll just have to keep going to Steak
Night.

Alas, there is no point to steak night without Kori or myself.  There is good 
cause for your lack of enthusiasm.  

Tomorrow morning sounds good to me for a coffee/steamed almond milk break.  
How 'bout we shoot for around 9:30 (although I can do earlier or later if 
need be).  Let me know.

As for the week after next, anything from Wednesday night on will work for 
me.  I am in full agreement with you regarding a "solid dinner" (of limited 
attendance of course).

See you tomorrow,

Susan

him (Does he think I'm in a vulnerable/weakened state due to the Ted 
situation?  Well, he's wrong.)

steamed almond milk? Let me know. I will be here through Friday morning--must

Hey Susan.

I just got a call from Patricia Ritter which made me realize that we only 
have 1 month to play all of our games... and with my travel schedule getting 
booked I thought I should get a start on playing some games.  Are you 
available anytime soon?

Thursday nights are always out for me as I have school from 6-10.  Next week 
I will be out of the office Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  

Let me know.

Part of me is tempted to do the "taste of your own medicine" thing, but I was 
really disappointed that he took that approach (in this case I think email is 
very cowardly) and don't believe two wrongs make a right.  I insist on taking 
the high road in this situation no matter how tempting it might be to teach 
him a lesson.

SusanI haven't done anything as of yet.  I just really didn't feel like responding 
to him on Friday (I was still pretty floored by the whole thing) and since 
he's out of town till tonight I spent yesterday and today figuring out what I 
want to do.  

I've decided the following...I'm going to give him a call tonight and agree 
to meet for a drink/chat.  I completely agree with you about regretting the 
things you don't do more than the things you do - besides I'm dying of 
curiosity about what he could possibly have to say.  Anyway, I want to try 
and do it tomorrow night so that I can quite turning it over and over in my 
head (I am absolutely sick of thinking about it).  I think it will be hard 
for me to be anything but distant talking to him because, regardless of his 
reasons, he definitely wasn't very considerate over the last few weeks.  Wish 
me luck! (Problem is I'm not sure what I really want the outcome to be).

SusanJulie,

Just wanted to check and see if you had received my last two emails.  If so, 
I'd love to know what you think about the whole situation.  If not, let me 
know and I will resend the emails.

SusanWhat's the word man?  I haven't heard a peep from you all day (even though I 
know you've seen Ben and called Kori...I'm hurt)

sscott5FYI - Gary P. Nunn is going to be playing New Year's Eve at Gruene Hall.

On the Ted front...It's Tuesday afternoon and I haven't contacted him yet.  
I'm planning on calling him at home early this evening and telling him that 
"a beer and a chat sound like a good idea, how about tomorrow night?".  I 
will be requesting that he either call me at home tonight if he gets in early 
enough or tomorrow at work.  This should all prove very interesting.

SusanGary,

Just wanted to check and see how things were going for you on 44.  Hopefully 
you are now in possession of a phone.  If so give me a call, I would really 
like to get together for a cup of coffee or just a few minutes to enjoy the 
lovely weather outside.

Subject: Revised Contract Approval Request - Phillips Petroleum Company

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Phillips Petroleum Company's discount letter was recently approved by 
Transwestern's Officer group.   However, Phillips has now requested that 
Transwestern include language in the discount letter which guarantees the 
applicable discount rate in the event that Transwestern's minimum Tariff rate 
were to be higher than the discount rate.  I have underlined the additional 
language  in the attached revised discount letter (language will not be 
underlined when provided to Phillips).  The inclusion of this language would 
require Transwestern to file the discount as a negotiated rate prior to gas 
flow under the term of the amendment.  Transwestern would file this discount 
on January 31, 2001.

Please review the attached document and indicate approval via REPLY WITH 
HISTORY.
All Officer approvals will be sent to Bill Cordes for final President Level 
approval.

will work for me.  Just let me know the location.

                   HOROSCOPE:     Weekly   -    His

                   For September 25-October 1: Instead of wishing
                   things were different, or woefully mourning the
                   past, build a new beginning. It's pointless to
                   bemoan recent changes or languish over
                   disappointments. You cannot change the past.
                   You cannot change people's minds, either. Face
                   your situation and create something wonderful.
                   The longer you fuss about what 'should have
                   been', the more likely it is that important
                   opportunities will drift by unnoticed. Cancer, it is
                   time for change. Release frustrations and
                   troubling memories. Move on, Crab. . . move
                   on. 


Mine for today

   Quickly get past a troubling misunderstanding
   Once you've released toxic feelings,
                   the atmosphere visibly improves, much to your
                   pleasure. You're able to replace fear and
                   resentment with compassion and
                   understanding. Once you know the score, you
                   no longer feel threatened or disrespected. Keep
                   revenge out of this entire episode. 'Teaching
                   someone a lesson' is not appropriate. 






                 






Greg,

Sorry it took me so long to get this to you ( the perils of bid-week).



Call me if you need anything else.

SusanSorry I didn't respond very promptly to your last email.  Things have been 
very emotionally draining for me around here.  I'm going to forward some of 
my recent email communications to catch you up on the issue.  After you've 
had a chance to take in the situation I would really love to hear your 
opinion.  Call or email with any insights.

Subject: We have closure! (well, sort-of)

I'm soooo good.  The chosen path was cool, indifference.  

So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a 
really good showing.  I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size 
swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00.  About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the 
one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of 
someone.  Can you believe it?  He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering - 
I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and 
overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the 
email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.  Anyway, Kevin saw me and 
came over to chat.  He informed me that "our friend Ted should be there 
shortly" to which I responded, "You would know better than me at this 
point".  The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.  
He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.  I said there 
really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 
weeks.  Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head 
and cause a big scene.  When I said no, I think he was genuinely 
disappointed.  I said in order for me to do something like that I would have 
to care about the "loss" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have 
cared a bit more, with each passing day the "loss" seems less and less like 
much of a loss.  Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.  To go even 
further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of 
his date Ted nor any of his "girl-friends".  He said that while he thought 
Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't 
good dating material.  I agreed with Kevin saying "Ted is a great guy, he 
just makes a lousy man" (don't you like that one?).  I then went on to say 
"Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?".  Kevin: "Much 
bigger and much better."  About this time my parents showed up...the plot 
thickens.  I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin 
were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.  The two 
of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when 
"dum-da-dum-dum" Ted shows up.  He approaches our group because he sees Kevin 
and is forced to make eye-contact with me.  I give him a "hey" and he gives 
me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant "how's it going?".  He asked what 
Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get 
Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away.  He never 
acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the 
evening.  The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for 
another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with "my group" for 
quite a while before going to join Ted.  My parents and I ate our steaks 
right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table 
when we were finished.  It really was a great night.  I would almost say I 
was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it 
wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).  So, 
when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to 
say good-bye to Kevin.  It was awesome.  Ted's sitting right next to Kevin 
while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in 
his chair.  Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even 
make eye-contact.  I ended up staying there for at least another hour and 
then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.  Needless to say I was 
very hung over today.  Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter 
ass-hole.  So I'm done.  And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back 
in to my good graces.  

Now on to a fun subject, my trip to London.  I bought my ticket today ( I 
think I got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket I could find - 
$450 before taxes).  I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7:00 a.m. 
Friday the 6th and depart about 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday the 10th.  I'm very 
excited about the trip, I really need to get out of Houston.  I leave the 
activities in your capable hands.  ( bear in mind I will have to see Darren 
and Nick at some point).

Bear in mind this next email wasn't sent until Friday afternoon (a full day 
and a half after the Steak Night debacle).

i have to admit, when i saw the copyline for this, i began to panic.  i
pictured you in a drunken about- to-go-over the edge rage....and then ted
stumbling onto the scene, and you unloading.  however, in lieu of the facts,
i'd say this was an unequivicable 'victory', if such a word can be used....
i think it's fair to say that you ended up w/ more on your side of the
tug-of-war rope, so to speak.  and although it's frustrating to see what
once seemed to be 'potential' turn into shit, it's easier to walk away- at
least i'd imagine it to be.  sounds like you're going to have a whirl-wind
trip- guess enron only can open the gates of hell to let you out for brief
blocks of time......isn't that kind of like the myth about persephone
escaping from hades......?  will try to plan a suitable agenda- still in
ther 'dazed and confused' period- been more concerned w/ where i can find
trash bags than hopping bars so far, but will try to fine tune my skills in
the time remaining- must go to class, but will write more later.  hate to
say it, but you prob. will be saddled w/ a care package for me from mom-
will try to make it in the 80lbs or less range....Em,

So, of course, I spent this whole past weekend trying to figure out how I 
want to handle this "situation".  Basically I've decided the following:
 1.  I will agree to meet him for a beer and a chat (I'm going to suggest 
Molina's - I think it's a good location, public enough & private enough)
 2.  I will be calling and leaving a message with him to let him know I will 
meet with him, NO email... and will request that he do me the same courtesy.
 3.  I will let him do the talking (I mean he's the one that wants to have a 
chat so he must have something to say)...at least to begin with
 4.  I will NOT be a push-over 

Well, what do you think?  Any suggestions/recommendations?  I am very new to 
this whole relationship discussion thing.  More importantly, do you think 
there is ANYTHING he could say/do that would or should allow him a second 
chance?  Right now I don't know if there is, but unlike you (and you know 
this about me) I do believe in second chances.  That does not mean that a 
second chance is a given in this situation.  Get back to me when you get a 
chance.  

Susan

- - I just know I would always regret not meeting with him Em.  This is a 
chance for me to prove that I can handle myself with maturity and dignity 
even with my emotions on the line.  I think ultimately, regardless of the 
outcome, it will make me a stronger person.  By the way,  we will definitely

puh-lease!   i know i just emailed you, but i had to respond.  sometimes
it's hard for me to email back in a timely manner since, w/o a laptop, i
only have computer mon-thurs.  sue, PROMISE me you WILL not sacrifice your
integrity and allow him to weasle in just b/c he has a guilty conscience.
i'm pretty sure you won't, but i'm just imagining as i sit here the stories
your mom and dad have to tell.....and that's just the tip of the iceberg!i'm
a firm believer in the one strike and you're out thoery, and of course,
based on a, his behavior in the last few weeks, b., the sage words of his
'trusty' friend kevin, who DID give your parents the time of day, c., his
behavior steak nite, and d., HIS BEHAVIOR!!!!- i'd say he's been benched.  i
wouldn't rule out an 'explanation beer', but i thinks it's time to lower the
blow, so to speak, cut your losses, and run like hell....

Mom said she was keeping you up to date on everything.  So, of course, I 
spent the whole weekend trying to figure out how I want to handle this 
"situation".  Basically I've decided the following:
 1.  I will agree to meet him for a beer and a chat (I'm going to suggest 
Molina's - I think it's a good location, public enough & private enough)
 2.  I will be calling and leaving a message with him to let him know I will 
meet with him, NO email... and will request that he do me the same courtesy.
 3.  I will let him do the talking (I mean he's the one that wants to have a 
chat so he must have something to say)...at least to begin with
 4.  I will NOT be a push-over (it's not in my character anyway)

Well, what do you think?  Any suggestions/recommendations?  I am very new to 
this whole relationship discussion thing.  Most importantly, do you think 
there is anything he could say/do that would or should allow him a second 
chance?  Right now I don't know if there is.

Susan

PS - I think I'm going to come over with Mom and Dad now in November.  I've 
been checking out airfare recently, ouch!  Anyway, I think were shooting for 
Nov. 9-14.  Talk to you soon.

I heard about the ongoing saga you are currently in
the middle of.  The nerve of that boy!  I think you
are right not jumping to return his e mail.  What a
coward, that he had to e mail you and didn't even have
the decency to call you.  What a weirdo!

Hey,

I apologize for being out of touch recently but I was on vacation last week 
and this week has been busy.  Things seemed a bit awkward recently and I 
would like to see if we could get a beer and chat next week if you are free 
(after Tuesday night because I'll be in Amarillo talking to feedlot operators 
early next week). Enjoy your weekend and my condolences about UT's fall out 
of the top 10.

Ted
It's kind of funny, everybody has the same feeling about the "Ted situation" 
- utter disappointment.  But yes, it is definitely his loss.  And, I loved 
the fact that Kevin (his friend) spent so much time talking to my Dad because 
that had to make Ted feel like a complete jerk (which he is).

I'm am very excited about my trip to London.  The other guy I mentioned in 
the email, Darren, is going to be working over there for a few months so I'll 
get to see him there as well.  Plus, in November I'm going to visit my 
brother and his wife in South Korea which should be interesting.  The globe 
trotting continues.

Your weekend sounds like it's going to be pretty fun.  I wish I could be 
there as well, but it is football season so I will be in Austin this 
weekend.  I've signed up for all these internet airfare specials though, so 
if some great fares come up for Houston to San Diego I can take advantage of 
them.  Talk to you soon.

Susan

- - Deep down I think I knew there was something wrong with him.  I think 
that's why I never pressed about the past relationships thing (you know, 
afraid of what I might find out).Lindy -- I'm working on a checklist.
There were just a couple of issues arising from the discussions with market 
services, weren't there?
One having to do with whether we want to change our 68 A to reflect FTS-1 and 
FTS-3 in same bucket -- I'm leaning towards not changing since the language 
is already general enough to cover us there.
The other issue had to do with issuing the OFO if EFBH does not show up in 
the last cycle.  I do not believe any changes are necessary there either.  
The tariff language as it's currently written says we "shall" issue an OFO, 
and we would, but an OFO issued in the last cycle would simply be a formality 
and the EFBH shipper would have no choice but to pay the penalty.
If you see any roadblocks on these 2 tariff sheets (27A and 68A), or if there 
are any other issues we need to address, let me know.  Also, if you want to 
sit down and go thru my checklist together sometime tomorrow, or even later 
this afternoon, I'm available.
Thanks!
S.

Subject: Re: EFBH Service approved  

The effective date will be 2/23/2000.  Marketing does not anticipate offering 
the service until March 1, 2000.

Susan is working on the compliance tariff sheets right now to be filed 15 
days after the Order is issued (the Draft Order was issued last Thursday, so 
the final Order should be issued within a couple days after that).  The 
change I think you're referring to is the way we had anticipated prorating 
FTS-1 & FTS-3 together when FBH is showing-up and now, we actually will match 
FTS-3 with the FBH space and FTS-1 will be allocated "existing" space as 
usual.  Susan is looking at the tariff language now and is thinking a 
language change may not be necessary.  She will be discussing with Mary Kay.  
Regardless of which decision, it's being addressed.

Were there any other tariff language changes? (I know FTS-3 should be added 
to 22.2, D, 1.  Susan and Mary Darveaux are reviewing all the GT&C's to check 
for where FTS-3 &/or FBH should be referenced, etc.)

Please let me know.  Thanks!
Lindy

Lindy,  
Does this mean that the effective date will still be 2/23/2000?

Also did all of our changes that we discussed in our system requirement 
meetings get included in the revised tariff sheets?

What date will marketing start offering the service? I know we are still 
pushing to have the nominations, contracts, scheduling & confirmation system 
changes ready for 3/1/2000  production migration move.

Thanks Ramona




Corey,

Here's an update, I sent this to Emily earlier today.  Let me know about this 
weekend (i.e. the game, tomorrow night, etc. etc.)

Subject: We have closure! (well, sort-of)

I'm soooo good.  The chosen path was cool, indifference.  

So, last night was Steak Night and with Nick and Wilson both in town we had a 
really good showing.  I got there about 7:30 with Nick, and the group's size 
swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00.  About 8:00 I saw Kevin (Ted's pal - the 
one you meet a steak night) wandering around LW's obviously in search of 
someone.  Can you believe it?  He (Ted) knew I had organized this gathering - 
I know that because Nick is working right across from he and Darren and 
overheard Darren encouraging Ted's attendance (mind you Ted was not in the 
email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.  Anyway, Kevin saw me and 
came over to chat.  He informed me that "our friend Ted should be there 
shortly" to which I responded, "You would know better than me at this 
point".  The subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.  
He asked if Ted and I parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.  I said there 
really weren't any terms, I just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 
weeks.  Kevin wanted to know if I was going to break a bottle over Ted's head 
and cause a big scene.  When I said no, I think he was genuinely 
disappointed.  I said in order for me to do something like that I would have 
to care about the "loss" and that, while a week or two earlier I might have 
cared a bit more, with each passing day the "loss" seems less and less like 
much of a loss.  Kevin told me I was better-off without Ted.  To go even 
further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of 
his date Ted nor any of his "girl-friends".  He said that while he thought 
Ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't 
good dating material.  I agreed with Kevin saying "Ted is a great guy, he 
just makes a lousy man" (don't you like that one?).  I then went on to say 
"Anyway, I'm destined for bigger and better things, right?".  Kevin: "Much 
bigger and much better."  About this time my parents showed up...the plot 
thickens.  I introduced Kevin to my parents and since both my Dad and Kevin 
were in the Navy and attended Colorado they had much to talk about.  The two 
of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when 
"dum-da-dum-dum" Ted shows up.  He approaches our group because he sees Kevin 
and is forced to make eye-contact with me.  I give him a "hey" and he gives 
me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant "how's it going?".  He asked what 
Kevin and my Dad were talking about, I told him the Navy, he said don't get 
Kevin started or you'll never shut him up...Then he walked away.  He never 
acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the 
evening.  The beautiful thing is Kevin stays and talks with my Dad for 
another half hour and when Darren shows up he hangs out with "my group" for 
quite a while before going to join Ted.  My parents and I ate our steaks 
right behind Ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table 
when we were finished.  It really was a great night.  I would almost say I 
was glowing (I was having so much fun with my friends and family and it 
wasn't a show for Ted's benefit...I really was having a great time).  So, 
when my parents decide to head out they walked over to Ted/Kevin's table to 
say good-bye to Kevin.  It was awesome.  Ted's sitting right next to Kevin 
while Kevin and my Dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in 
his chair.  Yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even 
make eye-contact.  I ended up staying there for at least another hour and 
then went with a few of the guys to the Ale House.  Needless to say I was 
very hung over today.  Anyway, there's the story...He's a complete and utter 
ass-hole.  So I'm done.  And no, there is no way he could weasel his way back 
in to my good graces.  

Now on to a fun subject, my trip to London.  I bought my ticket today ( I 
think I got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket I could find - 
$450 before taxes).  I will arrive at Heathrow airport around 7:00 a.m. 
Friday the 6th and depart about 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday the 10th.  I'm very 
excited about the trip, I really need to get out of Houston.  I leave the 
activities in your capable hands.  ( bear in mind I will have to see Darren 
and Nick at some point).

"Single again" Sue
In an effort to save a little time I'm forwarding you the email I just sent 
my friend Emily in London.  Get back to me if you would like me to expound on 
anything.  Turns out he's a real jerk.

"Single again" SueWhat time are you heading out today?Hey Wilson,

Steak night is on...And, yes Darren really did give me your keys and I've 
already handed them off to Ben.  Also, you'll be interested to know that my 
parents might make it tonight for a little while so you may get to meet 
them.  See you tonight.

SusanAlready done.

SusanThanks for the advice/humor.  I'm feeling much better today.  I knew 
yesterday was going to be pretty rough and not much fun as his communication 
or lack thereof would speak volumes.  (And his silence definitely said a lot)

Everyone's pretty much on the same page as far as their disappointment in 
said individual goes.  I think we all expected a little bit more out of him.  
Oh well, so I'm single again.  Just think how incredible it'll be when I find 
someone I feel even more for than Ted (at least that's what I'm focusing 
on).  So do we know if Pat Fitzgerald is single?

Anyway, I've found I'm not that attracted to cowards (which is exactly the 
catagory I'd put Ted in right now).

Hope everything's good with you (especially the firm recruiting).  I'm coming 
up this weekend for the game - hopefully Friday night - and wanted to see if 
you and Doug wanted to go out either Friday night or after the game 
Saturday.  I hope you guys are planning on going to the game because I'd love 
to sit with you.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Hi Susan.

Sorry I didn't respond to your email yesterday.  I opened it in between
classes, but never got back to my comouter and was out eating with a firm
until 11:00.  I will be glad when all of this is over.

The jury is split on what you should do.  Knowing myself, I would want to
know what happened...  i.e. what's the matter with him?  I think I would ask
him-- in a non-confrontational-- almost joking way-- like I didn't really
care either way but was just wondering-- why he stopped calling, etc.  I say
that, but I have never done that before, so I don't really know if that is
what I wish I would do, or if that really is what I would do-- and this has
happened to me lots of times.  Usually, I just write the guy off as gay or
stupid...

Leslie (and though I haven't talked to my mom, I know she would agree) says
not to give him any satisfaction of knowing you care.  Just act pleasant and
normal as if nothing has happened and is if you were actually the one who
stopped the contact-- maybe he thinks you were, you never know.  I think
this is a good tactic if you are sure your curiosity and need to tell him
off won't eat at you.

Actually, in practice, I usually combine these tactics.  Remember when
Michael Stockton was so rude to me freshman year?  First I called him and
told him off (Laura made me), then I ignored him (pleasantly, though)for
about four months until he couldn't stand it and started asking Laura about
me.

In other words, both tactics are good.  I really think you ought to do what
makes you feel the best.  If you confront him, he might say something you
don't want to hear, but then again, you will get some resolution.  If you
don't confront him, you can always chalk it up to his homosexuality and you
can feel better knowing he thinks you don't care...

If I ever see him again, I will ignore him (blatantly).

Don't worry about it too much-- we should feel sorry for people who are
still confused about their sexuality at 31.  Isn't he a little old to be
living in the closet?

Let me know what happens.

-Corey

- - You'll have to come up and visit 32 at some point.My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on 
point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of 
contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here:

**
 In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997), 
Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it 
submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that 
Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. 
Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off 
dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such 
information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes 
requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept 
confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years 
public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for 
confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market 
support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the 
contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of 
longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and 
support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed 
services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of 
the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made 
public. 

FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could 
terminate contingent on the
occurrence of certain events.

FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (1996).
**

In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas 
Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a 
request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission 
explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment 
but transportation contracts should not:  

the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a 
different
footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are 
subject to similar disclosure
requirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas 
sales in a
competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under 
the assumption that the pipeline
exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that 
competition is from other
pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting 
requirements. 

There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the 
context of Section 4 cases.  

Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the 
next few days and let you know if I find anything.

Susan's draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the 
Commission.  To save Susan from trying to translate my weird scribbles, I'm 
having Martha type up my vitriol.  Please hold off on detailed comments on 
Susan's draft unless you've already finished them.  I'll circulate a revised 
draft to you all later today.  In the mean time, Susan and Frank and Steve, 
are there not some cases in which the Commission has specifically granted 
confidential treatment of precedent agreements or discount agreements in 
expansion cases.  I know the bulk of authority is against us, but I seem to 
recall at least a few stray decisions where the Commission granted confid. 
treatment (even if only for a limited time).  Lets talk.  Thanks. DF

That actually made me cry.

SusanHey Corey,

So he's back in town now...The question is what do I do about that?  Should 
I:  A) Completey ignore him and pretend like there was never anything between 
us or B) Call him out and confront him with his own cowardess.  I am 
completely torn on the issue and have actually felt physically ill over the 
situation the last two days.  Help!!!

SusanOkay gang, it's time to rally the troops.  Evidently last week wasn't good 
for any of us to get together at our local watering hole (a.k.a Little 
Woodrow's)...but, I'm hoping the story is a little different this week.  Our 
own Nick Stephan is back in H-town for the week and has made a special 
request for a full-fledged "Steak Night" (that means good attendance).  Not 
that I ever need an excuse to enjoy good company, steak, beer, etc. at LW's, 
but if I did I could think of few better reasons than a visiting ex-pat.  
Besides, given the absolutely beautiful weather we are currently enjoying, 
the picnic tables and deck are beckoning.  I'm going to set a tentative 
meeting time of 7:30 p.m. this Wednesday...get back to me at your convenience 
and let me know if we should stick with that time or not.  Hope everyone had 
a relaxing weekend and is having a good Monday (isn't that an oxymoron?).

Susan

Hey,

Try lgillet@enron.com for Lisa's email address.  Glad to hear you're in the 
new pad...in the interest of saving $$$ I will probably take you up on the 
futon offer.  

Well, it's Monday and I'm assuming Ted's back in town (not that I've heard a 
peep out of him).  I'm very much at a cross-roads with the situation.  On the 
one hand, I want to be unaffected and aloof and on the other hand I don't 
want to make this that easy for him.  I think I deserve more that just being 
swept under the rug.  So, my debate becomes - Do I just let this thing go all 
together OR do I try and get some resolution?  

I would love to get a call from you hear at work.  The best time for me is 
probably before 11:30 or after 12:30 Houston time.  

Talk to you soon,
Susan

Just to forewarn you two, it looks like Darren (Ted's buddy) is going to be 
in London for a few months working on a project.  When I mentioned you two 
were both over there right now he asked me for your email addresses.  No 
pressure for you guys to do anything with him, but I do like the guy and 
think when I come over we will definitely have to do something with him (and 
Nick too of course...maybe the same night, that whole "kill two birds with 
one stone concept").  

Sue

Side-note:  I'm am dying of curiosity as to why Darren is going to London for 
a project and Ted is trading corn here.  Maybe I'll find out before Darren 
leaves.  
       Who knows, maybe if you all see Darren over there you can find out 
what the heck happened with our once so promising Mr. Noble.Do tell, Do tell.

Darren,

What's the word?  So when do you head over to London and what pray-tell will 
you be doing over there.  I'm planning on going to visit Em and Katy around 
the first weekend of October (sometime between the 4th and 10th), if you're 
going to be over there we need to all go out.  I don't remember if we ever 
talked about it or not, but I may try to do my third rotation there...the 
horror, Em and me set loose upon the unsuspecting citizens of London.  
Anyway, I'm assuming congratulations are in order, so congrats on the new 
assignment.

Here are Katy and Emily's email addresses.  I don't have phone #'s, etc. as 
of yet but I could get them for you if you'd like.  I'll be sure to shoot off 
an email to both of them to let them know you're going to be over there.

   katyhester@hotmail.com
   ehillegeist@hotmail.com

Susan

PS - We will definitely be doing Steak Night next week if you have any 
interest...a guy who used to work in Ben's old group (and is now trading 
credit derivatives in London...see how I'm hooking you up with all these 
connections) will be in town and is dying to go have steak and beer.  
Besides, it would be wrong for you to leave the country without a proper 
send-off from Little Woodrow's (Now I going to owe you a Bon Voyage beer as 
well as a birthday beer).

Susan,
I will be going to London fro a few months on a project.  If possible, I 
would like
to get the information for the lovely ladies from Tomball and Cypress that 
are 
calling Britain home.  Please forward it to me when you get a chance.

--Darren

Here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control 
agreement with ECS.  Please let me know your comments by C.O.B. tomorrow.  At 
this point I'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested 
by the Commission.

I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.  Their attorney is 
checking with his resident experts to make sure ECS, by expressly giving TW 
Operational Control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling.  I 
do not expect the agreement to change significantly.  
So who's up for doing something that Friday night?  I'll probably be in 
Austin Saturday for the football game, but am definitely interested in 
getting together with everyone.  Obviously this is planning WAY in advance 
for this group so we can revisit the topic when Wilson's arrival is a little 
bit closer.  Talk to y'all then.

Susan

* Darren - Please tell me you have Wilson's keys...Margaret and I would be 
eternally grateful.Hey, evidently I'm not the only one slacking on the emails - That means you 
Em.

Quick update:  I may try to come over Oct 5 - 10 instead of the 4 - 9 so that 
I can at least spend a little time with Katy.  How will that work for y'all?

Sue

P.S. - Thought you'd like to know that I am doing well in regards to the Ted 
situation.  I'm actually kind of glad he took this week long vacation...that 
whole out-of-sight, out-of-mind theory really works.
Sunday at 1:00 is good with me as well.  Just name the place.

See you guys then.---------------------- Forwarded by Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT on 09/14/2000 04:18

Subject: Enron Presentation

Dear Recruiting Team Members:

I am forwarding a copy of the Enron presentation to each of you for review.  
Some of you will be asked to do presentations, many will not.  I just wanted 
to send it out to various team members in order to give you an idea of our 
marketing strategy and information on campus.  This is simply for your 
information.  When this presentation is given, it will include  dates 
tailored specifically for each campus based on the dates I have set up 
through career services.

Have a great day!

      For September 14: You have a knack for bringing people together and
                     creating peace. Part of your success in waging peace is 
derived from a desire
                     to let go of resentment and a bulging catalog of woe. 
You're sick and tired of
                     feeling sick and tired, and look forward to a refreshing 
sensation of starting
                     anew. Seriously consider hatching deferred dreams today.

you're simply too good to tolerate that bullshit, and you'd be doing

eHey Scott,

Hope you had a good time at the game this weekend, despite the heat.  I just 
wanted to see if you were still interested in trying to grab lunch this 
week.  If you do, just let me know what day and time work best for you.

Thanks, 
SusanYou crack me up...I absolutely loved the trading analogy (at times your 
insight is frighteningly dead on).  

Don't worry about me though.  I will be patient and remain optimistic, 
despite let downs.  And, in no way, shape or form will I settle and end up 
with some dush.  You would have been proud of me though, for the first time I 
was really able to let down a lot of those walls and be a little more 
vulnerable.  

I'm thrilled things are going so well with Shannon.  I think your attitude 
about the whole situation is extremely healthy and mature (it amazing what 
happens when you care more about the other person than yourself). 

Talk to you soon,

Susan

* Be sure and let me know next time you're coming to Houston.  We'll go grab 
a drink and have a good talk.Thanks for the email.  Your candid comments make me wish I was over there 
right now sitting in a pub with you and Katy drinking a pint.  I am in full 
agreement that guys suck and have discovered through this situation an area 
in which 23 does not differ from 31...cowardess (As my Dad so eloquently put 
it, "He's just chicken-shit").  So, the plan of attack for the time being is 
none.  I am not going to do anything (that means no emails, no phone calls, 
no nothing).  Of course it's a lot easier to say that knowing he's in an 
entirely different state vs. two floors down from me, so next week will be 
the true test.  You will be happy to know, however, that I do have a good 
support system in Monique.  She is a firm advocate of the "drop him and make 
him work should he happen to come crawling back" school.  You know what 
really kills me though is the thought that, yet again, I will ultimately be 
disappointed by someone I truly expected more out of (I keep thinking about 
all the times I said "I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop." - well, 
it dropped) .  Anyway, I've have decided to throw myself into work, books, 
exercise, etc. in a effort to distract my mind from other things - it's kind 
of working.  

I'm really glad you are in enjoying things so much right now.  You have to 
email me back with more details regarding the new pad, like will there be 
enough room for me to crash there when I come to visit (if not, I'm sure Nick 
would put me up - scarey).  Also, I sent Katy an email about coming to visit 
so hopefully we can get everything squared away soon.  FYI:  The Longhorns 
beat Louisiana Lafayette 52-10 last Saturday (the game was fun, but extremely 
HOT!!!), it was a real nail biter.  
Talk to you soon,

*** Don't worry about me thinking any of this is in any way due to a 
shortcoming on my part.  I don't.  Rather, I am convinced he wasn't expecting 
the full package when we first went out and as soon as he realized that I 
was, he freaked.  I'm beginning to think it's more than just a coincidence 
that the last time we went out I let down one of the last walls I was holding 
up as far as trusting him and it was right after that that he started acting 
aloof. (Things that make you go hmmm.)Steve and Frank, I would be very interested in your comments on the attached.

Hey Katy,

Sorry no correspondence in a while.  I wish it was a case of no news is good 
news, but if you've spoken with Em recently you know that is not so.  Anyway, 
I wanted to touch base with you regarding my visit to London.  I of course 
want to try and time it when both you and Em are in town.  So...I was 
thinking of flying out on Oct 4 and returning Oct 9, that way I would have a 
weekend over there with y'all.  I know you're planning a trip to Egypt around 
then so just get back to me and let me know if you'll actually be in London 
any of those days.  Hope all is well with you.

Talk to you soon,

SusanHey Darren,

Thanks for the prompt response.  Sorry you won't be able to make it, but I 
will definitely keep you posted regarding any future group outings 
(especially since I still owe you a beer).  Glad you liked the quote, it does 
provide a good chuckle.  

If I'd have known you were going to be in London this week I would have 
forewarned Katy and Emily as they're both over there now as well - I assume 
you're there for work though and therefore a tad busy.  Anyway, hope you're 
having a good time and not working too hard...

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to test the waters and see what kind of interest there was in 
doing Steak Night tomorrow night at Little Woodrows.  I feel like it's been a 
while since we really rallied the troops and I know I have personally missed 
the interaction.  It's also been a while since we've attempted to solve the 
worlds problems over cold Shiner and I think the world may be the worse for 
it.  So, get back to me and let me know if anyone's up for an evening of 
eating, drinking and most definitely being merry.  If it looks like 'a go', 
I'll shoot everyone a follow-up email complete with ETA.

Well, I'm sure you've already heard through Mom...but I think things may be 
kaput with Ted.  I say "think" because he hasn't said anything one way or the 
other, it's just a vibe I have.  So I don't think you guys are going to have 
a chance to meet him while your in Houston.  Oh well, it was definitely fun 
while things were going well so I suppose I should focus on that.  I just 
want to know why guys can be such, as dad would say, chicken shits (excuse my 
language but the description fits).

But enough about me...So how are things with you guys.  I hope all is well 
and that you're taking full advantage of all the 'culture' surrounding you.  
We went to the first football game of the season Saturday (against Louisiana 
Lafayette).  Texas won 52-10, and you wouldn't know if from the score but the 
1st quarter was a little bit scarey (0-10).  Simms started the game but only 
played about 2 series before they yanked him and put Applewhite in to put 
some points on the board.  Simms did come back in the second half and through 
a touch-down pass.  The family's good and we're all excited to see you guys 
in the near future.

Write back soon,

So I'm thinking of taking the T-shirt Ted gave me from Beaver Creek and 
writing this on the back of it...

I dated Ted Noble and all I have to show for it is this lousy T-shirt.

Dont'cha love it?I was wondering if you had fallen off the face of the earth...

It is definitely good to hear from you, I was just thinking about you today 
and wondering what you're up to.  Things in Houston are pretty good.  I went 
to San Diego over Labor Day weekend to visit a friend of mine there and just 
went to Austin this past weekend for the first UT football game (I know 
you're not a big fan but they are very fun).  As for work, all is well.  I'm 
actually going to meet with the development manager for the analyst program 
to discuss what my options are after this second rotation is up.  Of course 
my goal is to do a rotation in London for a year and then get promoted to the 
Associate program (so basically I'm going to ask this lady tomorrow what I 
need to do to ensure that outcome).  Honestly, I think my odds are pretty 
good.  

Glad to hear everything with you is going so well, not that I'm surprised.  
Congrats on the new responsibilites they must be keeping you pretty busy up 
there (any trips scheduled to Houston in the near future?).

As for my social life...if you would of asked me a week or two ago I would 
have said fantastic, incredible, etc.  Now, I just don't know.  For the life 
of me I am never going to be able to figure out your gender.  But as they 
say, "Hope springs eternal" and I intend to remain an optimist despite many 
road blocks.

I'm great....great summer. my best friend from france spend 2 1/2 month with

Work is great, though very strssful and demanding...very nerve recking..but i

I'm now Manager of Internet Marketing and Manager of Alliances...that's my 
new job also...

NewPower is doing great and you will hear a lot about us in the near 
future...Were live, so that's really cool.

Life is great, socialy i'm pleased and i love NY.
Big summer, like a little rock super star...and i've just started working out

Hope your move into the new apartment went well.  I'm sure you are going  to 
have so much fun living there, especially since you really will have a 
roommate now.

Thought I'd give you a little bit of an update regarding Ted...

So I didn't get back to the office until Wednesday last week because I was in 
Austin Tuesday for that recruiting trip.  When I got in I of course 
immediately checked my email...nothing.  I also didn't have any messages at 
any of the 3 phones I can be reached through.  Come Thursday afternoon, still 
no interaction...I am pissed.  About 2:00 p.m. he calls.  He asks me about 
San Diego and I ask him about Austin...both trips were great.  We discuss 
UCLA and UT football for  a while...I of course get riled up.  He informs me 
that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard me corn) for Enron.  
While he is very excited about trading I get the impression he feels a little 
overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how much trading will limit his 
vacation time.  He said that he and Darren (the guy he works with) had been 
meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the week 
had pretty much just been one long meeting.  It is around this time that he 
brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a trader you work 
when the markets are open and you're only off when they're closed.  As a 
result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e. "I'm leaving 
tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week."  I make sure I heard him 
correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and  1 whole week (7 days) AND at 
no point does he ask to get together before he leaves.  So, that was 
Thursday.  I'm down on his floor again on Friday to talk to my old group and, 
to my dismay, run in to him.  We exchange pleasantries, I ask him when he's 
leaving (5:00 p.m.), he informs me he is going to sleep for the entire week 
in an attempt to catch-up, I tell him to have fun and that's that.

Anyway, I was not able to get him out for a drink to find out what's going on 
and now I just have to wait.  Any thoughts?

NW9742 legs 3-4
NW9790 legs 1-2, 4

let me know when you would be able to 
set these up.  These are the leftover deals
from that original list that I submitted to you.
Thanks for all your help!  I am pulling across
all the new ones that you set up for me last week.
I really appreciate it!

Hey Em,

First things first, I got the personality test...very interesting.  I took it 
twice.  The first time I was a Mastermind (like Katy) and the second I was a 
Mentor (like Matt)  I think I only changed two answers between the first and 
second test.  Anyway, definitely a fun little intro to a rather boring Monday 
morning.

I was trying to remember where we left on in the saga of Ted Noble.  I guess 
the last time I had emailed you Ted had to spend the night at Darren's 
apartment because he'd left his keys in his locker at the Met.  Well, if 
you'll remember at the end of the email he said he'd talk to me later, which 
is extremely relevant considering he was supposed to tell me whether we could 
go get a drink that night or not.  I knew he had his presentation that day so 
I figured he'd call later that afternoon to tell me yeah or neah...I received 
no call, no email, no nothing.  Of course, always wanting to give others the 
benefit of the doubt I figured the presentation must have taken longer than 
expected and afterward he'd decided to just go to Austin and pick up his 
friend from the airport.  If that were the case, knowing Ted, I thought he 
must have just forgotten that he'd told me he'd call.  WRONG!!!!  Friday at 
work I had to go down to his floor (for legitimate reasons I swear) and he 
was there, the jerk.  He didn't see me though nor did he try communicate with 
me at all that day.  

Flash forward to the next week.  I didn't get back to the office until 
Wednesday because I was in Austin Tuesday for a recruiting trip.  When I got 
in I of course immediately checked my email...nothing.  I also didn't have 
any messages at any of the 3 phones I can be reached through.  So it's now 
Thursday afternoon, still no interaction...I am pissed.  About 2:00 p.m. he 
calls.  He asks me about San Diego and I ask him about Austin...both trips 
were great.  We discuss UCLA and UT football for  a while...I of course get 
riled up.  He informs me that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard 
me corn) for Enron.  While he is very excited about trading I get the 
impression he feels a little overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how 
much trading will limit his vacation time.  He said that he and Darren had 
been meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the 
week had pretty much just been one long string of meetings.  It is around 
this point that he brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a 
trader you work when the markets are open and you're only off when they're 
closed.  As a result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e. 
"I'm leaving tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week."  I make sure 
I heard him correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and  1 whole week (7

was Thursday.  I'm down on his floor again on Friday to talk to my old group

he's leaving, he informs me he is going to sleep for the entire week in an 
attempt to catch-up, I tell him to have fun and that's that.

So here we are, or rather here I am in Houston...alone.  Any thoughts?

On a brighter note, tell Katy I think I'm going to try and come Oct 4 - Oct 9 
so that I can see both of you.  Also, I understand your dilemma regarding 
Claudia, but I definitely don't think you should look a gift horse in the 
mouth (if you know what I mean).  That first month after Katy leaves is going 
to be awkward so it's best to have someone there even if only to act as a 
crutch until you find your footing.  I'm sure Monique can testify to a little 
extra weight dealing with me since you and Matt both took off.  And speaking 
of Matt, no I haven't heard a thing from the turn-coat.  I need to shoot him 
an email and see how things are shaping up for him.  I'm willing to bet 
though that moving to Austin hasn't solved all of his problems...just 
transplanted to a prettier location.

Get back to me with anything...I'm desperate for positive energy.  Oh, and 
I'm going to try to meet with that Director friend of mine this week to talk 
about swinging a rotation in London (he has 75 employees over there that work 
for him right now), and I'm going to set up a meeting with the lady in charge 
of my rotations within the analyst program to make sure I'm doing everything 
I can to get over there and still get promoted.

think about whether it would be wise to do more selling in the first 
paragraph.  I propose that we get on the agenda for the March 1 meeting so 
that we have some time to approach individual parties first.  

With your permission, I will forward this to Mr. Dasovich also.

 Cheryl,

The deal was done with one of the California Power Books.  We use the 
ECC/RISKMANTRA to book any deal with an Enron subsidiary...not just Canadian 
deals.  So, I don't think this deal has anything to do with the Canada 
office.  Let me know if you need more information.

Subject: TAGG Deal NK4420.1

Hi Susan

I am trying to verify the liquidations for financial close and noted that 
TAGG deal NK4420.1 entered by yourself
shows ECC (Enron Canada Corp) as the counterparty.

Here in Canada, we do not to deals at NGI-PGE/CG and I do not believe that 
the book PWR-NG-LTCA is a Canadian
book.  A review of the audit trial indicates that the counterparty used to be 
EPMI.  Is it possible it was changed by
mistake to ECC.

Can you please look into this deal first thing Monday morning as we need to 
book the liquidations Monday am for
financial close and let me know what you think about this deal.

Thanks for your help.

next move, I know how quickly it will pass and do not want to find myself 
uncertain as to what action to take to insure that I am heading in the right 
direction to meet my current goals.  I would appreciate the opportunity to 
meet with you and discuss the aforementioned topics at your earliest 
convenience.  If there is another individual you feel would be a better 
contact for me at this point I would be happy to meet with them as well. 

Thank you,

ShortyDolores,

I was wondering who my best resource would be to talk to about the changes to 
the analyst program and how they affect me.  Specifically, I wanted to get 
some more information on the Third-Year Analyst Rotation and its requirements 
(as I am currently half-way through my second rotation), as well as the 
different tracks available within the program.  If you could direct to the 
proper individual(s) I would really appreciate it.  

Thanks,
Susan ScottThanks again for thinking of me.  Lunch next week sounds good.  Any day of 
the week is fine with me as long as we get started around 11:30.  Just let me 
know what day is best for you.

Scott,

Thanks for offering up your extra tickets to the game this weekend.  As it 
turns out, I don't think I'll be needing them - My sister has extra tickets 
next to she and my brother-in-law.  Hope you have a great time and maybe I'll 
see you at the game (although given the crowd I'm not going to count on it).

SusanThe reservation charge reduction applicable to TW's failure to deliver gas 
under certain circumstances does NOT apply to either force majeure events or 
periods of unscheduled maintenance less than 10 days in any calendar 
quarter.  Unscheduled maintenance is defined as unanticipated or unplanned 
maintenance on the pipeline system required to be performed to ensure that 
gas continues to flow in months other than Dec., Jan., Feb., July and Aug.  

Assuming we could even classify the proposed activity as "maintenance," I'm 
not sure we could get away with saying it was unanticipated or unplanned, as 
the Gallup expansion has been in the works for some time.  I am also not 
completely comfortable calling this "force majeure" because part of the 
tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either 
party; however, since the definition does include "binding order of any court 
or governmental authority," we could possibly say this is force majeure if 
we're reducing the pressure in order to comply with a DOT pipeline safety 
rule.  (In that event, our notice on the EBB would be a force majeure 
notice.)  If not, we can argue that since this is not "maintenance," but 
simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner, 
the shippers' rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction 
provisions.  In that case, damages (if any) would have to be pursued under 
ordinary contract law.  

I realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer; however, the outage is 
going to be relatively short, and no shipper in recent memory has availed 
itself of the reservation charge reduction.  I recommend we give shippers 
reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate 
plans -- this will reduce the likelihood that they will feel revengeful.

Please call (x30596) or e-mail if you have further questions.Em,

I cannot believe you ran into Ben Affleck!!!  I'm sure it's just the first of 
many celebrity sightings you will have in Jolly Old England.  I had an 
absolutely incredible time in San Diego with Julie.  We went to the beach 
(where I was able to lay-out and not sweat!), shopped a ton, attended the 
symphony and got messages.  All in all it was an extremely relaxing weekend.  
Yesterday, I was in Austin for a recruiting trip and got to see Corey's new 
house in Hyde Park - very cute.  

So I got back to work today, Wednesday, and still no word from Mr. Noble.  
Just to refresh, the last time I heard from him (email) was Thursday 
morning.  You'd be proud of me though as I have refrained from any form of 
contact and plan to continue that route only deviating if/when it becomes 
necessary for me to have a formal close to things.  I'm still hoping that 
will not be the case but am fully prepared for the possibility that my brief 
encounter with dating may be over for a while.

SueFirst things first...

Yes, I am still alive...Things with Wonder Boy suck (and for the time being I 
think we should refrain from calling him Wonder Boy)...I'll be leaving for 
Austin Friday night (1st football game of the season), but will be back 
Sunday and definitely want to get together while you're in town.

Hope all is well with you and that you had a fantastic holiday weekend.  Mine 
was incredible!!! I visited a friend of mine in San Diego and had the best 
time just hanging out, shopping, hitting the beach and attending the symphony 
(on the water no less).  It was definitely a good trip for my psyche as Ted 
has been less than impressive going on almost two weeks now.  I'm certainly 
not pleased about the situation, but at no point have I lost site of what a 
catch I am (and if he's not bright enough to see or appreciate that fact then 
I don't think he's bright enough for me).

Talk to you soon,
Susan

ok, i'm still forgetting people, so assure 'the others' i'm not snubbing
them intentionally, i'm just brain dead.  haven't gotten a chance to email
often b/c little access to the library, but will as soon as my computer
arrives, and you'll get more 'intimate' (pg-13!) messages when time permits,
until then.....hope all went well over the holiday weekend- no holiday here!
  school has started, and so far so good- very interntional class- but
strangely enough, one girl from san antonio who also wants to study art law-
and she wanted to escape " a bunch of incestual girls and guys who will
never leave home and never make new friends- just want to shop, get married,
and have babies" (not you ardie, don't be offended!)  i liked her instantly.
  still no permanent home.....will keep you posted.....but- bit of adventure
sunday- this stuff NEVER happens to me, so it made my month.
anyways....wandering by myself in chelsea on sunday and stopped to look in a
store window....wasn't paying attention when i turned around and brushed
against someone's shoulder- well- not just someone- BEN AFFLECK!  and with
gweneth paltrow (she looked like shit w/ long orange stringy hair and a kind
of whiney, hungry look on her face- he of course looked precious, but was a
little shorter than i'd expected- about 6'2)  i can't speak. and the road is
totally empty except us, so i just say excuse me, he says no problem, and
then just wander off, then turn to stare after them.  thought about chasing
them down, but realized how lame i already looked, plus, was in gym shorts
and pony tail and ratty sweatshirt, and knew ben COULDN'T realize i was "the
one" in that state....so, i ran to the nearest phone and called my mom.
well, that's about it- again. will write/call when get a spare sec.  miss

Sometimes I really worry about you...

I know it's not kind to laugh at the misfortune of others, but I must say I 
was rolling when I read your email.  It's a good thing I didn't send the 
other card I was debating over last night which alluded to the possibility of 
you and Darren spending too much time together (not as funny in light of your 
shack last night).  So how did you explain your attire this morning to your 
MD? 

Hope the presentation was a rousing success.

Hey,

Thanks for the card.  I got a good chuckle out of it.  You will appreciate 
this story.  I go to leave last night around 12:00 but somehow I don't have 
my keys.  Well, they were in my locker at the Met, which of course is closed 
at this point.  So, I stay at Darren and sleep on his couch.  Well, I try to 
sleep but his fire alarm keeps beeping ever 1-2 minutes and is really 
annoying.  So, being a guy, I take the alarm completely out of the wall with 
my leatherman tool.  Finally go to sleep and arrive in my same clothes and 
baseball hat at work around 7:30 to pick up my keys and head home and 
shower/change.  Of course this cannot go perfectly, so I run into my MD on 
the way to the Met parking lot. Smooth.  I finally arrive back at work around 
9:00 and miss the group's morning weather briefing.  I find this whole thing 
pretty funny and it is all due to my keen organizational skills.  I'll talk 
to you later.

 Parties represented at an informal meeting after the February 7, 2000 
prehearing conference discussed circulating redlined versions of the CAC 
settlement proposal as a point of departure for further settlement 
conferences.  Transwestern Pipeline Company submits the following comments in 
lieu of a redlined document.

 Transwestern fully supports the CAC's proposal of a path-defined receipt 
point structure that would define primary and secondary rights at receipt 
points on the SoCalGas system. Not only does the proposal satisfy the 
Commission's requirement that Hector Road be established as a formal receipt 
point, it is also consistent with open and non-discriminatory access and use 
of the SoCalGas system, and will help provide a reasonable degree of 
certainty so that all market participants can more effectively plan gas 
transportation.  CAC's proposed receipt point principles ensure that no 
upstream transportation provider will unduly be denied access to SoCal's 
system.

 Transwestern believes that the parties may still need to address certain 
details regarding implementation of the receipt point proposal that have not 
been fully described in the CAC document.  To this end, Transwestern proposes 
that implementation of the receipt point proposal be included on the agenda 
for the upcoming all-party settlement discussions.  Transwestern looks 
forward to a constructive discussion of the proposal and is confident that 
the parties will be able to agree on a plan for implementation.

sscott3@enron.comHey girl!  Thanks for the book and the CD.  I lazed around the house enjoying 
both yesterday morning.  After we played tennis, Bill took me to Berryhill 
for fish tacos (al fresco) and later that evening we went to yet another 
Christmas party, where I drank champagne (but luckily not too much).  So it 
was a good birthday.

Hi Susan! I meant to call you yesterday but somehow I never did. Hope you

along our gift to you whilst we were in Houston last. I hope so! Anyway, I
hope that you had a good day and that Bill took you out for a nice dinner.

Except for maybe a lipstick for the mem's,(was totally confused by the
selection at the HEB - need help) this elf is finished with Christmas
shopping. Good to have it done. Picked up some sox at Tar-zhay for her to
wear w/ the clogs.

i admit to being a little put-off by his 'tone'- if that's the correct word.
  you write a long, jovial, bantering note, and his response is cold and
blunt....it sounds like mr noble's project has zapped out all of his
personality......and we thought one of his better features was his
well-roundedness.....!  again , i think this is one of those subtle and
shaky things you can't really 'call' someone on, and it's best to leave the
ball in his court.  of course, if he comes around when he's less
'distracted', i would tread carefully, and w/ some aloofness- no reason you
should have to 'jump' when he says to! gauge how he acts post-holiday- there
will be no project excuse, and then you can see how much validity this
theory holds.  am completely disoriented right now- sleeping pattern is off,
have raging PMS, and am a little homesick, as i knew i'd be at first.  both
mom and dad  succeeded in slipping horribly weepy cards into my purse before
take-off (which was a weepy mess in itself).  of course, i found them on the
plane and made an absolute scene sniveling and crying big fat baby tears.
verrry attractive!  am going to be really glad actually when school starts
so that i can begin to get acclaimated and don't feel like such a fish out
of water.  need to finalize when you're thinking about coming over.....i
know it's sometimein oct- and kates said she has to leave on the 12th for a
wedding thing.  as i said, jeremy's wedding is the weekend of the 14th, and
i know that was a week you discussed coming.  i don't have tickets, but if
it's physically poss for me to find a good ticket home, i prob. will have
to- gogo started crying when i said i prob. couldn't come, and i promised
i'd try.  but then again, i don't want to mess up the vacation plans you've
been setting up for a long time.  hopefully we can find a 'mutually
beneficial' time for the visit- let me know what you're thinking, and we'll
work from there!  am writing from the computers at katy's school, and don't
know how long i am allowed to, so will try to check back asap!  hope all is
well- miss ya'll!

Em,

Glad to hear that you arrived safely in your new home.  I'm sure you'll be 
adjusting to the time change for a few days, but hopefully this time you 
won't get sick.  Say, "Hi" to Katy for me and tell her I will email her soon 
to try and figure when is the best time to come visit.  

Now on to the business at hand.  Thought I'd let you see the last email 
exchange between Mr. Noble and myself.  Start from the bottom with my email 
and then read his response.  I would love to hear your insight on it all.

Here's my thought at this point.  I think Ted is an EXTREMELY linear person, 
in that his focus can not be split between too many different things at 
once.  To that end, I believe this project, to which he has dedicated many 
hours, has literally harnessed all of his attention.  Realizing this, I'm not 
sure exactly how I feel about it - - - Any thoughts?

Hey Pavarotti,

Hope you day is going well and that everything is coming together for the big 
presentation tomorrow.  My day is going significantly better than yesterday 
so I am pleased.  Plus, my friend just emailed me from San Diego to inform me 
that she can get us a great table to see the Symphony's last performance of 
the season on Navy Pier...so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  By 
the way, what did you end up deciding to do about this weekend - or haven't 
you decided yet (the latter would not surprise me in the least...you're a fly 
by the seat of your pants kind of guy or a slight procrastinator - - I always 
get the two confused).

Now for the rule-breaking.  I realize it's already Wednesday but I wanted to 
see if you had any interest in going to grab a bite to eat or just a drink 
after work tomorrow or Friday night (in light of our heavy work loads, etc. I 
hope you can forgive my rudeness).  Both you and Darren looked pretty whipped

going on.

Hey Pavarotti,

Hope you day is going well and that everything is coming together for the big 
presentation tomorrow.  My day is going significantly better than yesterday 
so I am pleased.  Plus, my friend just emailed me from San Diego to inform me 
that she can get us a great table to see the Symphony's last performance of 
the season on Navy Pier...so I've got that going for me, which is nice.  By 
the way, what did you end up deciding to do about this weekend - or haven't 
you decided yet (the latter would not surprise me in the least...you're a fly 
by the seat of your pants kind of guy or a slight procrastinator - - I always 
get the two confused).

Now for the rule-breaking.  I realize it's already Wednesday but I wanted to 
see if you had any interest in going to grab a bite to eat or just a drink 
after work tomorrow or Friday night (in light of our heavy work loads, etc. I 
hope you can forgive my rudeness).  Both you and Darren looked pretty whipped 
last night and I'm sure tonight will be more of the same...You better be 
careful, I think this project is starting to give you gray hair.

Shorty

- - I forgot to tell you last night that my 5 yr. old niece got in trouble on 
the way to school yesterday because she punched a little boy in the eye.  
Evidently, he was bothering she and her friend Reagan...I think my sister's 
biggest fears have now been confirmed, little Sally may have taken after her 
Aunt Sue Sue a little too much.

Both deals have been rebooked.

Julie,

Sorry for the delayed response.  I can't express to you how excited I am to 
be coming out there this weekend.  After the last week and a half of work I 
am in desperate need of rest and relaxation (that of course means lots of 
shopping).  As far as activities go, I'm pretty much up for anything.  My 
guess is I'm probably going to want to take a quick nap when I get in 
Saturday morning before starting the weekend's activities, but after that I 
say we just get going.  The symphony sounds incredible as do the races or the 
polo match so I'll just leave the final choices to your discretion.  I would 
definitely be up for a trip to the zoo if you want to go, but considering I 
go there every time I'm in San Diego I could miss it in order to do/see some 
other things.  The only things I insist upon are ample time outdoors and good 
seafood.  Anyway,  I arrive in San Diego on America West flight 2180 at about 
9:00 a.m. and leave Monday at 6:10 p.m. so we've almost got three full days 
to work with. 

Love,
Susan

-- Also, if you could give me an idea of what kind of items I need to pack 
depending on our activities it might prevent me from committing gross 
overpacking...Thanks.

3/5983Jeff, this morning I spoke with Reliant's regulatory counsel, who called me 
after talking with Lee Hart, and who seemed eager to look into drafting a 
filing.  I would be happy to talk with Leonard Foster or June Suwara at 
Sempra about doing the same, but somehow think Sempra might be a tougher 
customer (don't know why I would think that...).  My suggestion is that we 
work through Ms. Katz initially.  Anticipating that we might encounter some 
inertia at Sempra's regulatory dept. -- and to give you an outline to work 
from when talking to Stefanie -- I put together the attached rough draft of a 
motion to intervene and motion to expedite to be filed by Sempra.  

Feel free to send the attached to Stefanie.  However, please do so with the 
caveat that you are sending it for discussion purposes only, not as legal 
advice to Sempra from ET&S's legal department, and the content of this 
pleading should ultimately be up to Sempra's legal/regulatory staff.

Reliant's counsel said he'd be sending me a draft of his pleading...if I 
don't hear from him within a reasonable time I'll call to follow up.

The offer still stands but the location has changed...We're meeting at the 
Gingerman instead of Kenneally's (so alas no pizza - but oh, what a selection 
of beer).

Do we need to talk?Julie,

Everything you have mentioned up to this point sounds incredible.  I would 
love to see the symphony, got to a polo match or the races, etc. etc.  I've 
made everybody here at work green with envy talking about my trip.  I'm going 
to email you back tomorrow with a much more detailed response to your emails 
because I'm trying like mad to get out of work before 7:00 tonight.  Anyway, 
like I said it all sounds great and I am very excited about the trip (believe 
me it's much needed).  

Susan

I'll give you the exact times tomorrow, but my flight gets in around 9:00 
a.m. on Saturday and doesn't leave until around 6:00 p.m. on Monday.  Talk to 
you tomorrow.Read it and weep...Just let me know if you want me to bring some sand back 
with me in case you don't make it out there this weekend.  I'm thinking I may 
need to get Julie to hook me up with a job like hers...if it will allow me to 
live like we're evidently going to this weekend.

HI Susan-

I'm so excited for your visit this weekend!  Whenever you get a chance, let
me know your arrival time on Saturday and departure on Monday so I can plan
around them both....

I've been brainstorming some fun things for us to do, and thought we could
spend some time lounging at the beach, shopping at the outlet center near
me, go out for a champagne bunch on Sunday, grill out on the beach, and
possibly go to a polo match or the Del Mar races.  Which of these interests
you?  Are there any tourist sites that you would like to see while in
town?  The zoo, Balboa Park (where all the museums are), or anything
else?  Oh- I've arranged for us to have a massage on Monday- the woman is
coming to my house!  We'll each get a 30 minute massage....I think this
will be great quality, girl time!  I've missed our shopping binges!

Please bring any current pictures of friends and family- I can't wait to
hear how everyone in your life is doing.  Weather has been beautiful as
usual- about 75 degrees and perfect.  In the evenings it gets cool enough
to wear you need a light sweater or jacket, but you can always borrow
something from me, too.

The condo I'm living in now is tiny, but cute.  I've been living there for
a year and am moving out in 2 weeks.  I could have moved out this Labor Day
weekend, but obviously didn't want to be doing that while you were in
town.  So you'll have to excuse a bit of the mess and come back another
time when I move into the cuter place- I love the new place I'm moving
into- it's 2 stories with vaulted ceilings and lots of skylights.

See you soon!
Julie

This one kind of gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling inside.  Knowing that you 
are benefiting mankind by working for the Big "E".

Subject:  New Enron Deal

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
-----------------------
Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said
to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.
In the deal, Enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades'
facilities throughout and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former
CEO of energy monopolist Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy
management division.  Said Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant
heating demands.  While eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they
require vast and reliable fuel resources.  Enron was the only supplier
willing to make a deal with my boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just
like the way they do business."
A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations.  According to the company, "The deal fits both
companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and retain new
customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to
come."  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades' high heating
demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very
attractive energy portfolio addition.
Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained high
growth rates over the last two thousand years.
Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications companies.
The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and communications
assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best 100 Companies to
Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A
Week," and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by
customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply
contracts.

Cinderella in Her Later Years.......

Cinderella was now 75 years old. After a fulfilling life with the now
dead
Prince, she happily sat upon her rocking chair, watching the world go by
from her front porch, with a cat named Bob for companionship.

One sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the Fairy Godmother.

Cinderella said "Fairy Godmother, what are you doing here after all
these
years??"

The Fairy godmother replied "Well Cinderella, since you have lived a
good,
wholesome life since we last met, I have decided to grant you 3 wishes.

Is there anything for which your heart still yearns?"

Cinderella was taken aback, overjoyed and after some thoughtful
consideration, and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish:

"I wish I was wealthy beyond comprehension." Instantly, her rocking
chair
was turned into solid gold. Cinderella was stunned.

Bob, her old faithful cat, jumped off her lap and scampered to the edge
of
the porch, quivering with fear. Cinderella said "Oh thank you, Fairy
Godmother".

The Fairy Godmother replied, "It is the least I can do. What does your
heart
want for your second wish?" Cinderella looked down at her frail body,
and
said: "I wish I was young and full of the beauty of youth again."

At once, her wish having been desired became reality, and her beautiful
youthful visage had returned. Cinderella felt stirrings inside her that
had
been dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began to
course through her.

Then the Fairy Godmother again spoke "You have one more wish, what shall
you
have?" Cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and
says";
"I wish for you to transform Bob, my old cat, into a beautiful, and
handsome
young man".

Magically, Bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his
biological
make-up, that when complete he stood before her, a man, so beautiful the
like of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birds
began to fall from the sky at his feet.

The Fairy Godmother again spoke: "Congratulations, Cinderella.

Enjoy your new life." And, with a blazing shock of bright blue
electricity,
she was gone. For a few eerie moments, Bob and Cinderella looked into
each
other's eyes, Cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly
perfect man she had ever seen. Then Bob walked over to Cinderella, who
sat
transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young
muscular
arms.

He leaned in close blowing her golden hair with his warm breath as he
whispered:

"I bet you regret having me neutered now, don't you?"





Can we keep the upside -- I believe the answer is clearly "no" unless/until 
we get a favorable ruling on our share-the-upside filing.  Til then we're 
bound by the billing provisions on Sheet 95H.
Sometimes the answers clarify themselves after you leave the question sitting 
out there a while...

As for the contract rights of replacement shippers, I would say the tariff 
language gives us some leeway on whether to automatically give replacement 
shipper the releasing shipper's discount at alt. points.  If we don't, and 
the replacement shipper uses an alt. point and has to pay max rate, releasing 
shipper gets a refund under our billing provision.  I know Lindy has some 
clear ideas on what we want here... we can discuss more if you like.  Agustin,

You are right, the correct deal number for Industrias del Etileno is just 
NW9742 (legs 1 & 2).

Lexi,

I will be able to attend and am going to try to get to Austin in time for the 
faculty lunch.  I will let you know if I can make the lunch for sure after 
I've worked out my travel arrangements. 

Thanks,
SusanOkay, I have to admit it is somewhat of a pansy schedule and it is going to 
be like that for about the next three years.  However, this season will give 
us the perfect opportunity to get all of our freshman and sophomores the 
necessary experience needed to win the National title two to three years from 
now.  Mack Brown is a master at pacing a teams rise to the top.  With the #1 
recruiting class in the country last year and a top 5 class this year the 
future looks bright for the Longhorns.  Besides, our stadium's on campus and 
we've sold over 40,000 season tickets...the games are bound to be fun 
regardless of how weak the opponents may be.

Counter?

Hey Shorty,

Sorry your week has been going poorly (I guess you feel like I did Wednesday 
night).  But on the bright side, college football starts this weekend which 
is always a plus and today is Friday which makes this bad week over.  I am in 
middle of packing once again for another move but the good news is that I get 
kicked out by 5:00 today.  I was checking out UT schedule and it looks like 
they have a pansy schedule (unlike UCLA that has to play Alabama #3 and 
Michigan #4 early in the season).  Any comments on that?

Same dude...and he is good.  We're going to Steak Night tonight at Little 
Woodrows which of course makes me happy.  Also, I just sent him a list of all 
the UT games so he can start planning to attend.  As soon as he decides on a 
first game I'm going to have to start preparing him to meet the family and 
others.  That's a lot of prep work.

* Home games are in burnt orange...what else?I've reviewed Order 637 on voluntary auctions and agree with you, Mary Kay, 
that the TW IOS procedure is consistent with the Commission's checklist.  
However, I do have a couple of questions/concerns.  First, does "voluntary" 
mean filing a proposal with FERC is also voluntary?  Or is the Commission 
here requiring that pipelines make filings before they can proceed with 
auctions?  Also, I'm not sure we comply with the Commission's policy on 
establishment of a reserve price, since it's difficult to tell what that is 
from the order.  A couple of times TW has stated a minimum bid in its IOS.

Comments?  The counterparty for that deal is Enron Omaha and the contact is Larry 
Paulou.  I am working on clearing up any other deals booked with the 
counterparty as New this morning.  Let me know if there is anything else you 
need.

Hey there yourself,

Sorry I haven't written you guys in a while to keep you properly updated.  I 
am indeed checking on flights to Seoul and don't think I'm going to go at 
exactly the same time as my parents.  As much fun as they are, I figured we 
would probably do some different things than what you have planned for them.

As for Ted, things are still going well although I haven't see him at all 
this week (we are two very busy people).  But, we had a great laid back day 
last Saturday and I think have hit that comfortable stage...you know, not 
quite so formal about dates etc.  In one sense it's great, but it also makes 
things a lot harder to read.  Anyway, I'm sure my Mom told you guys but 
Travis and Kathy got to meet him and I think it went well.  Hopefully, if 
we're still dating come December, you and Chuck can meet him when you come 
back to visit.  I'm planning on dragging him to at least one of the U.T. 
games, I just have to find out when he wants to go (as well as properly 
prepare him for the Scott/Kelley/Parks/Wild Card gang and the full-day affair 
that is a U.T. game).

Things in Houston are good and definitely warm.  I went with Emily and her 
Mom last night to see the musical "Rent" and it was wonderful.  Also, I'm 
going out to San Diego for the Labor Day weekend to visit Hoot's daughter 
Julie.  Needless to say I am very excited.

Talk to you  guys soon,
Susan

Hey girlie,

How are you doing?  Haven't heard from you in a while.
 A little birdie told me that you were checking into
tickets for Seoul.  Are you really?  Would you come
with your parents or separately?  In any case, we have
had some more time to do some exploring (and
shopping), so we have some good ideas about what to do
if you come.  I think that we will stay in Korea when
your parents come and do the whole base thing (which
will take only a few minutes, actually), but are
considering going to China or somewhere during part of
Thanksgiving.  We'll do whatever you want want if you
still are coming!

Let us know the latest with Ted and also with what's
going on in Houston.

Take care,
Chris

Hey Tonto (a.k.a - the trusty, but silent, side-kick to the Lone Ranger or in 
this case the Big D)

The play was very good and I think well received.  I'd forgotten how blown 
away I was by some of the songs the first time I saw it in NY.  The cast 
members really have to have incredibly powerful voices to pull off a few of 
the most poignant numbers ( I think this could be your true calling).  I 
caught the third day of Corey's Jeopardy run last night here at the office 
(yes, I had to come back after the play...I love my job!).  Anyway, I'm sure 
I'd mentioned it before but yes she is a very smart girl.  As a result of 
that, she has managed on several occasions over the years to detract from my 
enjoyment of playing Trivial Pursuit or watching Jeopardy by absolutely 
obliterating me (The girl actually did her senior thesis on Trivia).  

Kori told me she saw you last night at Steak Night and introduced herself 
since I failed to do so the last time we went.  I should let you know though 
that she was very offended this morning that you didn't spell her name right 
in the email - I mean it's such a common spelling.  So was Darren there last 
night to meet her or do you just think they'd make a good match?  She's a 
very fun girl.  

Hope you day is going well and that the move to 30 went off without a hitch.  
Good luck with all of the "fun" meetings.

Shorty

success with the road test...I'm going to assume that you didn't get around 
to it.

How was the play?  I forgot to tell you that I saw your friend on a re-run

Smart girl.  I ran into Corey last night at LWs and I am thinking this is a 
girl for Darren.  Anyway, lots of fun meetings today.  I'll talk to you later.

Maybe you should ignore the sentiment of the quote I sent earlier...I think 
you may be adhering to it too faithfully.  At this rate we may have to start 
pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things.  However, having 
driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to 
pass the test with flying colors.  Keep in mind though that if you end up 
failing I will not let you forget it (and, as we have established, I have the 
memory of an elephant).  

I'll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 
32.  Now back to what's really important...you.  Thought you'd like to know 
that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec. 12 and will performing

Shorty,

What's going on young lady.  Hopefully, your week is starting off well.  
Things were busy Sunday night through yesterday and don't appear to let up 
very much (although our idea most likely will get the axe in the short 
term).  Well, have to run (Darren is calling) but I'll give you a call later 
today.

Ted

I know how much you're looking forward to "Ted's Weekend of Rest and 
Relaxation" and I also realize that carting me back and forth to the car 
dealership wasn't exactly on your list of things to do (bear in mind the 
dealership is roughly 5 minutes from your apartment)...So, I'm offering you 
an out.  I can find someone else to help me if you want to bail (I know how 
important your pool-side time is - Remember it's all about you and your 
needs."  Just let me know.



FYI:  Galveston does not look like this...Hey Hot Stuff,

I know how much you love these spoofs so enjoy.  Hope your having a good day 
or at least, given the circumstances, a tolerable one.

I've gotten a bit more educated about IT revenue crediting since you asked 
your question yesterday.  "IT revenue crediting" is an industry term used to 
describe a requirement (brought about either by a FERC order or a rate case 
settlement) that IT revenues in excess of a certain dollar amount will be 
credited back to all firm shippers in the next rate proceeding or thru some 
refund mechanism.  Transwestern is currently not under any IT revenue 
crediting obligation, and I would be very hesitant to negotiate any such 
obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the 
same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis. 

If you need more info, let's talk.
Thanks for the info...you are a wealth of knowledge.  As for the jokes, I am 
very afraid and yet undaunted.

Do me one last favor and tell Darren I said he's a real funny guy and that 
there will, at some point, be appropriate pay-back.

I am taking every step to ensure that I leave this building at a reasonable 
hour today.  Unfortunately, it is "bid-week" (Nat Gas trading thing which 
translates to beaucoup deals/trading) so the odds are somewhat stacked

is definitely do-able.  However, I do reserve the right to alter my estimate

Now this is an intense web site =  
http://www.intbadfed.org/home.html#anchor443465Our contract with IGS provides that for any agreement identified by IGS and 
executed, TW will pay a one-time incentive fee of 3% of the first $15 million 
of net present value, 2% of the next $10 million of net present value, etc.

The Southern contract associated with the Gallup Expansion is at a rate of 
$0.205 for 25,000 Dth/d for 5 years.  Using a discount factor of 15%, the net 
present value of the contract is $6,270,625, so IGS's commission would be 
$188,118.75.  Since the contract does not specify how NPV will be calculated 
(I believe we purposely omitted this for whatever reason), we will need to 
agree on a rate that is fair given the nature of and risk associated with the 
project.  We should probably use whatever is standard in the industry for 
this type of project, if that's possible to determine.  I have a call in to 
James Centilli for his recommendation in this regard, and will let you know 
what he says.A good wit is a terrible thing to waste...

As for the pick up, the Sissy Crawford taxi is at your service.  Just name

Hey Bo,

I was checking on some flights for myself and happened to look at one-way 
tickets from New Orleans.  It looks like the refundable, no-advance purchase 
ticket is going to run you about $100 on Southwest...Lucky for you they do 
offer a senior citizen fare for $55 (age does have its advantages).

Sissy

By the way,  I didn't  even realise John Cleese and Denise Richards were in 
the movie...and evidently at some point Bond hijacks a submarine.  Roger 
Ebert actually thought so much of the film he gave it 3 and 1/2 stars.  We 
may have to watch this one at some point.

              "The World Is Not Enough" is a splendid comic thriller, 
exciting and graceful,
               endlessly inventive. Because it is also the 19th James Bond 
movie, it comes with so
               much history that one reviews it like wine, comparing it to 
earlier famous vintages; I
               guess that's part of the fun. This is a good one.

I think you had, at one point, asked me if the first U.T. football game was 
Labor Day weekend.  It is actually the weekend after Labor Day (Sept. 9) 
against Louisiana-Lafayette at 11:30 a.m.  So basically it should be a very 
challenging game and relatively cool (Ha!).  Hope your day's going well.

Fifth grade assignment

The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment: 
Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at 
the end of it. The next day the kids came back and one 
by one began to tell their stories.  

Kathy said, "My father's a farmer and we have a lot of 
egg-laying hens.  One time we were taking our eggs to 
market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when 
we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying 
and broke and made a mess."  "And what's the moral of 
the story?" Asked the teacher.  "Don't put all your eggs 
in one basket!"  "Very good," said the teacher.  

"Now, Lucy?"  

"Our family are farmers too.  But we raise chickens for 
the meat market.  We had a dozen eggs one time, but when 
they hatched we only got ten live chicks. And the moral 
to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're 
hatched."  "That was a fine story Lucy."

"Johnny do you have a story to share?"  

"Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my uncle Bob.  
Uncle Bob was a pilot in Vietnam and his plane got hit.  He 
had to bail out over enemy territory and all he had was a 
bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. He drank the 
whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then he 
landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.  He killed 
seventy of them with the machine gun until he ran out of 
bullets, then he killed twenty more with the machete till the 
blade broke and then he killed the last ten with his bare hands."
"Good heavens," said the horrified teacher, "What kind of moral 
did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?"

"Don't fuck with Uncle Bob when he's been drinking."

There is nothing wrong with simple and understated when it comes to a 
non-native Texan acquiring western wear.  Remember slow and steady wins the 
race.  One needs items they could wear at any given time (Red Wings a simple 
classic hat)...not just to the Vail Rodeo.

Attached for your review is the letter agreement which locks in the Gas 
Conversion Agreement pricing. 


Thanks for the joke, it provided me with a well needed chuckle (You and 
Darren definitely have too much time on your hands).  As for the hat/casual 
western theme, we are going to have to go to make a trip to Blanco's or Tin 
Hall sometime so I can don the full regalia.Just because your trader is out of town on vacation doesn't mean he can't get 
a hold of you and make life less than pleasant.  How a person can be in 
Hilton Head, SC and still sound like he's going to have a heart attack is 
beyond me.Hey yourself, 

Actually, my day is going very well.  It just so happens that my trader is 
out of town all week so, except for a few stressful phone calls this morning 
to assess the market, the day has been relatively uneventful.  All I want to 
know is how do I get your hours (or should I say lack thereof).  Anyway, my 
roommate and I had already made plans for tonight, but a movie tomorrow night 
sounds good.  Just fill me in on the details.  

Susan

PS - I'll be purchasing my neon, leopard-print cowboy hat shortly.

Hey,

I hope your day is going well.  I will be in Colorado Wednesday through the 
weekend, so I want to see if you were free to see The Perfect Storm before I 
leave on my mini-vacation.  These 3 and 2 day weeks are really getting too 
much. Just let me know if your schedule is free for a 9:00 show either 
tonight or tomorrow and I'll talk to you later.

Ted

Ted, 

I spoke with Shanna a little while ago about your friend and the apartment 
and she said she was fine with the deal.  Talk to you later.

SusanTed,

Getting back to work has been a bit of a challenge after a weekend of 
indulgence and excess.  It took everything I had to get in the car and start 
the drive back to Houston Tuesday night (especially since I stopped by my 
sister's and tooled around on Lake Austin in the boat for a while before 
heading out).  As for the birthday shot, you are quite welcome - it was the 
least I could do.  

After my expenditures over the holiday, I will definitely be in town this 
weekend.  So, dinner Saturday sounds good.  As it stands right now, I am 
having a very pleasant day and I hope you are as well.

Susan,

How is getting back to work after living the high life in Austin?  Thanks 
again for the birthday shot and I wanted to see if you were free this weekend 
for dinner - say Saturday night (being the well organized guy that I am - I 
lost your home number otherwise I would have called).  Hopefully, you are 
having a good day and I'll talk to you later.

Ted  

Hi yourself,

Glad to hear you all had a good time in Thailand, although I get the 
impression you could have done without some of the sights.  Mom thinks it 
must be fate that this guy and I keep bumping into each other.

Along those lines, I had an absolutely incredible weekend.  I drove to 
Harlingen Saturday morning/afternoon (5 hr. drive) for a friend's wedding and 
then drove to Austin to meet up with Emily on Sunday.  We ate at Guerro's and 
then hit Cedar door for a little while.  There wasn't anything going on there 
so I suggested we try Cedar Street.  Funny thing is Ted, that's his name, 
walks by our table at the bar.  He stopped to say hello and ended up sitting 
down with us the rest of the evening.  His friends joined us as soon as they 
had been shot down by the girls they had been trying to woo.  We ended up 
going to Polly Esters for a little while to do some dancing.  Before we 
parted ways he asked if we had any plans for Monday night and got my cell 
phone number.  Needless to say I was feeling pretty good.  He called us 
Monday and we made plans to meet up after dinner -- we ate at Sullivan's, it 
was very good.  His birthday is July 4 (how great is that?) so I brought him 
one of those travel size bottles of Crown from the honor bar as a birthday 
gift...Big Hit.  Anyway, spent the whole night talking and getting to know 
each other and all I can say is he seems like a really good guy.  (One of the 
best signs was his reproach of denim shorts on guys, especially cut-offs...be 
sure and tell Chuck about that one because I know it's something he feels 
pretty strongly about as well.)  So at this point I'll pretty much just run 
through the stats:

Height :   6'2" - 6'3"
Weight : about 225 lbs.
Education: UCLA (undergraduate and MBA) AND Law School ( I'm not sure where)
Birthday: 7/4/69 -- YES, he was born in a different decade than me...think it 
may be more of an issue for him than me.
Hometown: Santa Barbara, CA

ETC:  Youngest of three children.  Appears to like/be close to his family.
  Irish Catholic (we actually discussed religion)
  His dad was in the Navy
  Favorite Movies -- Fletch, Caddy Shack...he definitely has a good sense of 
humor and likes to laugh
  He really likes Texas...would like to have a ranch/lakehouse somewhere in 
the hill country

Best Quotes:    "Every California guys idea of a dream girl is a girl in 
jeans a t-shirt and cowboy boots." 
  "Every Texas girls idea of a dream guy is a guy who lives on a ranch, has 
an good education, is comfortable financially and is also a great    
businessman.  Only problem is there are only four of those guys out there and 
three of them are married."
  "Texas girls have the ability to wrap a man around their finger quicker 
than any group of women I've ever met."
  "I really want to learn how to two step."
  
So, as I'm sure you can tell there are definitely some attractive 
characteristics to this guy (to boot he was a complete gentleman in every 
capacity).  There are no plans as of yet, but I will be sure to keep you 
informed of any progress.  Write back soon and let me know how the apartment, 
the job hunt and everything else is going.

Susan

Hey Susan,

What's with this new man who keeps popping up
everywhere?  I heard you have seen a lot of him
lately!  You'll have to e mail me back and fill me in
on the scoop.

We had a great time in Thailand.  They are right when
they say it is exotic.  We saw some pretty ronchy
things there, too.  I'm not sure it if were the old
men with the young boys and a million of those clubs
or if the clubs "featuring" women were worse.  Anyway,
we got to see and do some pretty interesting things
and ate some really good food.  Chuck is expanding his
palate (sp?).  Hope all is well in Houston!

Hey Ted,

Just wanted to check and see if you guys are still going planning on going 
tonight.  We have been having some major systems issues today so I'm about to 
really throw myself into my work in an effort to get out of here at a 
reasonable time.

SusanYes...I am a true Longhorn.  I think that's why I like Steak Night so much.  
I mean how can you beat sitting on a deck, drinking a beer and solving the 
words problems (OK., 2 out of 3 ain't bad).  Anyway, Wednesday night sounds 
good to me, although, given how work has been going lately I doubt I'll be 
able to get there before 7:30.  Just do me a favour and forewarn Pat that 
Emily may be attending so he can prepare properly (I don't want any 
bloodshed).  I think a couple co-workers are also planning on coming so it 
should a good group.

Susan

Thursday night was indeed a blast.  I think my cohorts were ruing my 
existence by the end of the evening because I didn't have to go to work 
Friday (wedding in Dallas...very fun).  I'm sure you managed to have an all 
right time in SF as well.  I am definitely up for a bucket of beer this 
week.  It's supposed to be sunny and warm all week long and I can think of 
nothing that goes better with that than cold beer.  As for Austin, I have a 
wealth of information on the subject that I would be more than happy to 
share.   

Susan This may appear to be somewhat of a random email, but I assure you there 
exist some semblence of reason.  I remembered you mentioning that neither you 
nor Pat have ever made a pilgramige to Blanco's.  So...I thought I should let 
you know that there is live music and cold beer on tap tonigt at the Big B.  
Anyway it should be pretty good.  Music starts at 9:00.Lorraine, I've been studying the El Paso/Dynegy reservation reduction 
mechanism (RRM).  Basically the deal was that Dynegy's minimum-pay obligation 
would be reduced by the amount of the fixed cost component of IT revenues 
generated by El Paso's transportation of IT volumes above a historical 
threshold.  (The parties based the threshold on El Paso's monthly IT volumes 
for the 12 months ended 9/30/97.)  The volumes in excess of the threshold 
were calculated and a ratio of the volumes in excess of the threshold to the 
total volumes was determined; the ratio would then be applied to the fixed 
cost component of all IT revenues and the resulting dollar value applied to 
Dynegy's monthly reservation charge, to the extent Dynegy had not met its 
minimum pay obligation for a particular month.

This provision of course met with heavy opposition; however, FERC allowed 
it.  FERC stated that while the RRM had anticompetitive effects because it 
created a disincentive for El Paso to discount IT, it was not unduly 
discriminatory.  The "unduly discriminatory" conclusion was based on an 
analysis on the potential effect on the Cal. gas transportation market -- the 
Commission found that due to relatively weak market demand, neither Dynegy 
nor El Paso appeared to have been able to influence prices because so much 
firm capacity was available.

I assume Russ may be after something similar to the RRM.  We would have to 
file it as a negotiated rate but I feel fairly confident that we could get 
FERC to accept it.  

That's my 2 cents worth on this particular issue...I'll come down around 3:30 
to chat with you more about the Duke (I have a conference call with MKM from 
1:30 to 3:30, which is why I'm camped out on 47).Read the very bottom....

Compliments of your minion.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
-----------------------
Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said
to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.
In the deal, Enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades'
facilities throughout and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former
CEO of energy monopolist Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy
management division.  Said Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant
heating demands.  While eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they
require vast and reliable fuel resources.  Enron was the only supplier
willing to make a deal with my boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just
like the way they do business."
A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations.  According to the company, "The deal fits both
companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and retain new
customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to
come."  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades' high heating
demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very
attractive energy portfolio addition.
Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained high
growth rates over the last two thousand years.
Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications companies.
The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and communications
assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best 100 Companies to
Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A
Week," and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by
customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply
contracts.

                   probability for better relations with friends,
                   coworkers, and relatives. Try to establish
                   healthy, positive change no later than the Full
                   Moon. Take steps to insure your financial and
                   business future on or before May 28.AQUARIUS

                   HOROSCOPE:    Weekly 



                   For May 15-21: You're moving away from one
                   base of operations into another. Your
                   priorities and basic requirements are also
                   shifting. You find yourself relying less on
                   something you've clung to in the past -- and
                   moving closer to something newer, fresher,
                   and more invigorating. You've got a rage to
                   live and a burning desire for peak
                   experiences. Middle of the road choices
                   won't do it for you. Your hankering to push the
                   envelope could get you into hot water with the
                   old guard and certain close associates or
                   relatives -- possibly because they're afraid of
                   being replaced. But the genie is already out
                   of the bottle, Aquarius. You can't unlearn what
                   you've already tasted. Change is rolling in on
                   its own power now. Go with it. . . and try to
                   enjoy the ride. . .

You are the best.  I sit on 32 now, 2376c to be exact.  When you hit the top 
of the stairs hang a left then turn left at the next possible opening.  I'll 
flag you down.  However, I would be more than happy to come down and pick up 
the check.  Just let me know what works best for you.

Je toujours ai su que le francais se sont penses superieur, je ne me suis pas 
rendu compte cela etait vrai pour les haut-parleurs francais aussi.Recently we approved a "based on utilization" rate in another contract -- the 
rationale was that our minimum reservation charge is zero -- so on those days 
they don't use the point, the amount allocated to reservation component 
(using our discretion to allocate between reservation and commodity) is $0 
and it's still within our minimum so it is not a negotiated rate.  Does that 
make sense to you?

night.  They really enjoyed meeting you and finally being able to put some 
faces with the names.  At one point I believe my Dad even stated, "I love 
this place...now we'll have to come here every Wednesday." (An idle threat 
though don't worry).  They, as well as myself, are definitely fans of the 
topical conversational range ever present at "Steak Night".  Our own, though 
at times juvenile and base, version of the Algonquian Table.

Now on to the "food for thought"...I had a hard time narrowing down my 
selections today so please bear with the number of quotes and their seemingly 
unrelated themes (I just couldn't cut any more).

"Courage, it would seem, is nothing less than the power to overcome danger, 
misfortune, fear, injustice, while continuing to affirm inwardly that life 
with all its sorrows is good; that everything is meaningful even if in a 
sense beyond our understanding; and that there is always tomorrow." -- 
Dorothy Thompson

"One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary 
form as the main aim in life. The most important motive for work in school 
and in life is pleasure in work, pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of 
the value of the result to the community." -- Albert Einstein 

"Among those whom I like or admire, I can find no common denominator, but 
among those whom I love, I can: all of them make me laugh." --W.H. Auden

"Learn to give yourself what you wish you could get from somebody else." -- 
Steven Ouellette

"The game of life is a game of boomerangs. Our thoughts, deeds and words 
return to us sooner or later with astounding accuracy." -- Florence Scovel 
Shinn

"We must all suffer one of two things: the pain of discipline or the pain of 
regret or disappointment." -- Jim RohnSorry I didn't return your call last night, Lisa and I went to hear Julie 
Andrews speak at Jones Hall and didn't get home until after 10:00 p.m.  
Knowing what a precious commodity sleep is I refrained from possibly 
disturbing your own."The greatest good we can do for others is not to share our riches with them, 
but to reveal their own." - Author Unknown 

"One should guard against preaching to young people success in the customary 
form as the main aim in life. The most
 important motive for work in school and in life is pleasure in work, 
pleasure in its result, and the knowledge of the value of

"The game of life is a game of boomerangs. Our thoughts, deeds and words 
return to us sooner or later with astounding
 accuracy." -- Florence Scovel Shinn"1. Do what's right. Be on time, be polite, and be honest; remain free from 
drugs; and if you have any questions, get out your Bible. 
2. Do your best. Mediocrity is unacceptable when you are capable of doing 
better. 
3. Treat others as you want to be treated. Practice love and understanding." 
           -- Lou Holtz (Three rules for success)

of the non-SoCal settlement parties" so often.  Could we just not say 
anything on those items?  Or say TW has no comment at this time.  Would the 
other parties be put off if we were silent on these issues?

Attached see my marked-up version of your work product.  Mark, I think you 
did an excellent job of identifying TW's position in all of the issue in the 
GIR.  However, on editing, you'll see that I truncated some of the TW 
comments in favor of a slightly shorter document -- particularly in those 
areas in which it was questionable whether we have a direct interest or not.  
Look over and give me your feedback.  Thanks.

I understand we're supposed to offer these comments to Craig as soon as 
possible for possible inclusion in a 2nd generation "issue matrix?"








Where were you last night?Tell Lisa that EOL sucks...I've had to rebook 40 screwed up deals...hope to 
be there by 7:00Turns out my boss is going to get to Teala's at @ 5:00.  So if you want to 
show up earlier, say 6:00/6:30, I'm sure that would be cool.  I know Ben,

they are planning on getting there.I'm finally having my going away Happy Hour with my old group tonight so I'm

While I don't truly fear you becoming a bitter individual as a result of 
these negative experiences, I do feel the highlighted section below is now 
more appropriate than ever.

One must keep their eyes open and use all of the wisdom they possess when 
they trust.  Just as I suggested that positive experiences can cause one's 
level of trust to grow exponentially, negative experiences can cause 
irreparable harm.  If you trust blindly or too willingly and that trust is 
violated it colours every aspect of your life.  There are too many people in 
this world that have become bitter and cynical, not because they were born 
that way but, because they handed out trust haphazardly and too many times 
that trust was thrown back in their face.  I don't mean to suggest from the 
above that one should live in a day-to-day mind-set of distrust but rather 
that they must really look at people and all the aspects which they posses.  
I have come to the conclusion that if you spend most of your time observing 
and listening to people rather than always taking the lead you will learn a 
great deal more about them and their character.  The smallest acts and 
statements can in fact say the most, so always be observant. (This includes 
listening to what others have to say and paying attention to the opinions of 
people whom you respect.)

To that end I have one last comment...I am constantly amazed and periodically 
reminded what fragile creatures we humans are.  That beyond the hype and 
self-grandizing the basic components of ourselves (our experiences, fears, 
cares, concerns, needs etc.) cannot be completely disregarded and will always 
be a part of us.  I think that only by recognizing those components and 
trying to understand their origin can we truly become stronger.*31455

As you know, current firm contracts on Transwestern provide for delivery of 
250 MMcf/d of gas to Topock.  In the context of the Gallup Expansion, 
Transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 MMcf/d to 
Topock.  Once the Gallup expansion is built, Transwestern will have a total 
of 290 MMcf/d of firm capacity under contract to the Topock delivery point:  
40 MMcf/d more than PG&E has agreed to accept while PCBs continue to be 
present.

Bill Cordes has asked what Transwestern's potential liability to shippers 
would be if PG&E's refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence 
of contaminants causes Transwestern to have to curtail firm service at 
PG&E/Topock.  The legal answer is that Transwestern's tariff provides for a 
reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought 
by a shipper.  

More specifically, Rate Schedule FTS-1 specifically provides for a 
reservation charge refund if Transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm 
shipper.  In December, January, February, July and August, the shipper is 
entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed 
quantities not delivered.  In all other months, the shipper is entitled to a 
refund only if deliveries fall below 75% of nominated/confirmed quantities 
for a period of 75 consecutive days. The tariff does not preclude a shipper 
from seeking other damages resulting from Transwestern's failure to provide 
service under an FTS-1 contract.  A shipper whose firm service is curtailed 
would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge, including, 
for example, the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the 
shipper's inability to fulfill contractual obligations. Such damages could be 
recovered in a breach of contract action.  Not all shippers would incur such 
damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate 
points if capacity is available at such points.

Bill has asked Steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure.  
I could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential 
damages.  Can we meet briefly to discuss this?  I'm available after the 
Gallup meeting tomorrow a.m., or after lunch on Friday...or we can discuss a 
meeting time for next week.  Thank you.O.K.  Just wanted to see if we're still on for Saturday night.  Let me know 
if anyone else wants to come because I think I'm just going to order the 
tickets today over the phone or on the internet.  Also, I was trying to 
remember how much I covered of your meal the other night at Sabroso's.  I 
think it was around $15, so if it's okay with you I'll just pay for your 
ticket and then take the difference from the amount you sent in that email 
and cut you a check for that amount (I know I'm very delinquent).  I promise 
I'm good for the money.  Also, was wondering if you're still interested in 
the Bruce Cockburn concert on the 11th.  Just let me know.  Hope your having 
a wonderful day.I just finished having lunch with Tobin and he filled me in a bit about this 
morning's meeting.  I don't know how you reacted, if you were upset, etc.  
but I wanted to offer this up if you were struggling with the situation.  
Whatever happens and whatever is said about your move don't ever lose sight 
of the fact that in every aspect of this situation you conducted yourself in 
the best and most open manner possible.  In no way can or should your conduct 
be called into question.  Bearing that in mind any criticism that was 
expressed within the meeting this morning was beyond inappropriate.  I am 
sure it reflected much more poorly on the accuser than it did any of those 
being criticized.  Furthermore, just keep focused on what an incredible 
opportunity this move is going to be for you and all of the doors it will 
inevitably open.  There isn't a doubt in my mind that you are bound for great 
things, you just have to seize the opportunities that will lead to that when 
they come along (which is exactly what you've done).  

Keep your chin up and whatever you do don't doubt yourself or your actions.Again Mark I am flattered that you include me in these explanations...but I 
don't really need them anymore.

Is it really so you can look at girls or so people can look at you?
  
  I think your right about everyone being able to beat anyone with one 
important caveat.  The individuals in question must be in the same strata.  I 
would not anticipate that an olympic medal winning long-distance runner could 
be beat by Joe Shmoe who runs every day at Memorial Park.  Of course if one 
is patient and bides their time they could probably stand a shot when the guy 
gets really old and slow.

Also, are you so bold as to suggest you've never lost?  Or do you not 
identify them as losses but rather the results of your own choosing?

Christine -- Here's a brief answer to your questions.

With regard to segmentation, Order 637 is completely silent with regard to 
rates to be charged for segmented capacity, so we would have considerable 
leeway here.  The order is also silent with respect to the effective 
restriction of segmented capacity by making discounts inapplicable to certain 
alternate (or primary) points.  Hopefully TW will be able to avoid the 
segmentation issue altogether by invoking the Global Settlement, as we plan 
to do in our rehearing request and compliance filing.  (Our Global Settlement 
argument is that we should be able to rely on tariff provisions, including 
our current restriction on changing primary points, that were implemented to 
mitigate the effects of turnback on TW).

On hourly service, I believe that we could put an hourly service into place 
on TW without  running afoul of the Peak and Off-Peak Rates (i.e., seasonal 
rates) provisions of the order.  In other words, I think the Commission would 
see them as two separate kinds of service.

As for how to communicate with our customers, I believe Regulatory has 
offered to have a meeting with TW customers in early April to make a 
presentation on Order 637 and provide a forum for discussion.  I realize the 
order becomes effective March 27; however, compliance filings are not due 
until May 1, and some requirements do not even become effective until 
September 1.  Before the beginning of April, the GPG pipelines will simply 
not have their positions fully formed enough to make a very well-organized 
presentation to persons outside the company.  The meeting is still in the 
planning stages and I will fill you in on details as they are available.  In 
the meantime, if your customers have questions, I'll be happy to help answer 
them.

Subject: 637 Summary Items

Thanks Susan for the 637 summary.  Here are a couple of items that I need 
additional clarification on:

1)  Segmentation -  You summarized " Pipelines must allow segmentation to the 
extend operationally feasible and cannot hide behind current tariff 
provisions ...  "    Does this mean, for example, an Ignacio to California 
contract (i.e. 40,000 Dth/d at a $.20 total path rate) could be segmented by 
the shipper such that on any single day they could nom 40 MM/d from Ignacio 
to El Paso Blanco as well as 40 MM/d from Blanco to California?  If they 
could, would the $.20 apply to each segment such that we could bill them 80 
MM/d ($.20) for the time period that they flowed on a segmented basis or 
would they only pay the $.20 applied to the contract's 40 MM/d MDQ?      
Another scenario would be if the shipper is allowed to flow based on this 
segmented basis, but unless the discount letter providing the $.20 
specifically provides for a negotiated segmented transport rate the shipper 
will be billed MAX rate for some or both of the segmentated paths (?) if 
these paths are not already provided as "alternate" receipt or delivery 
paths?  

2)  Peak & OFF-Peak Rates. - You summarized " The policy does not apply to 
long-term shippers with contracts for 12 or more consective months of 
service."   

 TW will eventually file for hourly rates, however, the parties most 
interested in this service will be marketers serving a generation station, or 
the generation station's own gas supply manager/purchaser.  Most likely these 
contracts WILL BE of a longer term nature than month to month or even 
seasonal.  I need to reconcile your summarized comment to what we will expect 
from the marketplace.

Thanks for your feedback.  Since 637 is effective March 27th, I am eager to 
be able to speak intelligently to my customers regarding some of these more 
critical issues.  Thanks.

How was NY?Just wanted to ease your mind and let you know that I have not discussed your 
impending move with anyone save those you have already informed.  I am well 
aware of the sensitivity of the subject.  Believe it or not, sometimes I am 
able to keep my mouth shut. Ginger,  I would very much like to participate in the meeting this Thursday.  
However, given that it is bid-week, I cannot absolutely guarantee my 
attendance.  If it is at all possible for me to include myself with the 
caveat that I may have to pull-out last minute I would really appreciate the 
opportunity.  Please let me know if this is all right and I will do 
everything I can to attend.

are you saying it's just the three of us?
which is fine with me..
but i don't know if you can handle Ben and I on a good day

Our regular Wednesday night crowd will be somewhat diminished.  However the 
most important individuals will be present...Us.Who's picking on me?

I'll see what I can do but most of my girlfriends live in other cities and 
besides who wants to expend energy entertaining second string candidates?

    For April 2000: Your mind is so active, inventive,
                   and unlimited this month that you're capable of
                   almost anything! (You've privately believed that
                   the rules don't necessarily apply to you.) This
                   month, your incredible adaptability and powers of
                   persuasion help you shed the status quo and
                   break out of the corral. Unless you catch your
                   foot in a bear trap, nothing can stop you. People
                   are fascinated by your mind, wit, ideas, and
                   conversation. (Don't forget: Oprah Winfrey is an
                   Aquarius!) Your views are welcomed and
                   provoke others to investigate things they may
                   have taken for granted. Speak up during the first
                   week, especially if it's to announce you're
                   starting a new venture. Business travel is likely
                   during the first and third weeks, especially if
                   contractual issues need to be finalized. Travel is
                   actually enjoyable this month and can open your
                   eyes to fresh horizons. Aquarius. . . you've
                   dragged your tin cup across the bars long
                   enough. I smell a prison break. . . . AQUARIUS

                   For April 17-23: Travel plans shape up and
                   morph into much more. Every step you take
                   seems to branch out into a sea of possibilities --
                   especially lately. The old rules don't apply
                   anymore. The idea of signing up for something
                   and hanging in there until retirement doesn't suit
                   an innovator like you. Your developing success
                   will beget an avalanche of more success. Have
                   your bags packed in preparation for spur of the
                   moment opportunities and travel necessities.
                   Your wanderlust is starting to surface in a big
               way. You want to know more and experience life
               on a richer level. You're not the same person
               you were even a year ago. You understand more
               about yourself. Be open to travel, moving,
               advanced training, and additional contact with
               media and publishing. The word is out, Aquarius
                   -- and hard-to-pass-up offers are already in the
                   mail. . . .You know me...any excuse to celebrate.  Name a time and place...amazingly my 
calendar appears to be open tomorrow night.

Just found out from Minal that you guys are going to Osteria D'Aldo for your 
shower.  I hope you have a wonderful time but I have to warn you that the 
wine selection is extensive and the food is fantastic (although not very 
low-cal).  I know you're in the final stretch of the bet, however this just 
might be cause for a loss.  

Bon Appetit!Mike no longer writes actual tickets.  Confirms can find the information in

I would have expected no less.



Donna Fulton is planning on attending the technical conference in the 
Amoco/Burlington complaint proceeding on El Paso's allocation procedures.  
She has asked that we let her know, if possible, what particular issues we 
are interested in, as this will help her prepare for the conference.  Please 
let me know if you have any comments in this regard.

One caveat:  the technical conference is for "interested parties" only, and 
since TW is not an intervenor Donna is subject to being kicked out of the 
conf. if El Paso does not want TW represented there.  ENA will probably be 
sending a representative so at the very least we can probably get some 
intelligence from them.Here's the answer to your question regarding 28.  The depth and complexity 
are overwhelming.

As per our discussion of this a.m., ENA IT has a "program fix" in Stage which 
will handle 
the generation of confirmations for Gas Daily swaps that may be booked as two 
legs in the
future.  This change effects both TAGG - Deal Capture and TAGG - Deal 
Clearing.

In order to be ready for the commercial people in case they use the two 
legged Gas Daily
deal, I am requesting that your Gas Daily team input maybe 20-25 deals in 
TAGG - Deal
Capture using the new guidelines.  Ron Nolte has outlined below how the input 
process 
should be handled for these types of deals.

I will be out of the office Monday and Tuesday of next week so I am 
requesting that the Gas 
Daily team have these deals in by next Wednesday.

Thanks for your help.

Bob,

Ricky is in the process of changing TAGG Deal Clearing to be able to combine 
the deal leg
containing the Nymex ( fixed )  price and the deal leg containing the Gas 
Daily( float )  price onto one
confirm.

In order for this as well as the changes to the Settlement process  to work, 
the following rules
must be adhered to when the deal is captured.

1) The fixed price must be entered as leg 1.
2) The float price must be entered as leg 2.

3) Leg 1 and leg 2 must be "linked" by clicking the "Link" button on the deal 
capture
 window and by inserting a row as follows:

 

 The "Purpose" above will be listed as "Deal Link" when the picklist 
displays.  The "Link" can be
 done from either leg 1 or leg 2.

 4) The  confirm can only be created/revised/viewed/printed/faxed  from leg 1.

 5) The clearing status of the deal can only be changed from leg 1.

 Please note that  any change to the status of either leg will be reflected 
on the other
 leg automatically; e.g., assume a confirm is created on leg 1,  the deal 
status of both 
 legs will display "Generated".  Then assume someone changes leg 2 in Deal 
Capture,
 the status of both legs in TAGG deal clearing will be automatically set to 
"Pending -
 Revised after Generated".

Thanks, Maria, this is very helpful.  I'm planning on drafting something this

do anything similar but I'll find out.

Subject: Re: Gas Sales on TW?  

FYI a little more background:  

The Amgas relationship began as a result of TW's efforts to unbundle under 
Order No. 636, whereby we assigned gas purchase contracts to Amgas.  In 
addition, we had them administer certain remaining gas purchase contracts as 
well as our de minimus sales function.  All Amgas does today is administer 
our sales function.  We never eliminated our sales function; we just 
transferred the administration of it to Amgas.  

The marketing affiliate rule requires that a pipeline's sales division be 
treated as a functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate.   Our standards 
of conduct provide that the Vice President of Finance and Accounting is 
advised of pertinent sales activities by Amgas but does not participate in 
any of the day-to-day operations of Transwestern's merchant function.  As a 
result, the VP is not a shared operating employee under Standard G.  FTS-2 
transportation service is the unbundled no-notice transportation service the 
(former and current) sales customers received under Order No.  636.   I think 
we should be able to file revised standards saying that the merchant function 
is even smaller than it was when we unbundled [true?] which is not enough 
work for an agent to perform and that we've brought it back in house and 
explain why the person with the sales function responsibility is not a shared 
operating employee under G.   Maria

Subject: Re: Gas Sales on TW?  

This sounds like a good candidate for a waiver application to FERC.  If we 
can save the $60,000/yr, it would be worth asking FERC for authority to 
simply use an ET&S market services person to administer the farm tap sales 
from time to time, without any functional separation or other junk.  We could 
even list the specific sales contracts we have so FERC would be comfortable 
that we are not going to expand the business.  The NN situation was different 
(I think) because NN had formally notified FERC that it was discontinuing use 
of its sales rate schedule.  Would TW use the FTS-2 rate schedule?  We have 
never formally discontinued the TW sales function, right?   What do you guys 
think about the likelihood that FERC would approve such a waiver?  Has it 
ever approved similar small-volume waivers?  DF

Subject: Gas Sales on TW?

I've been asked to look into whether TW may administer its farm tap sales 
contracts directly or whether we need to continue to use AmGas.  TW no longer 
has any gas purchase contracts, just a handful of sales contracts to persons 
who granted rights of way to TW.  Many of these parties don't even buy gas on 
a regular basis, but they still have the contractual right to do so.  We pay 
AmGas around $60,000/year to administer the contracts.  The AmGas contract is 
terminable on 30 days notice.

I know that last year NNG re-established its pipeline sales division to make 
occasional gas sales and for other economic reasons (i.e. the base gas 
deal).  Do you think it would be worthwhile for TW to do the same?  Looks 
like NNG had an easy time getting its filing approved, but would like to hear 
from you what all was involved behind the scenes -- in other words, was it as 
easy as it looked?  

Another idea that Maria suggested would be to apply to the Commission to 
waive the Section 284.286 requirements in this instance since the remaining 
sales contracts are so few and insignificant. 

Your comments would be most appreciated!

Quite good.  They definitely provide a chuckle.So Burton hits me with "I hear you drink like a fish.  Supposedly you were

information he told me "From our friend on 28."  I promptly sent the 
following message "Nice...so do you inform everyone you come in contact with 
that I drink like a fish?"  Result, no response to me but he called Burton to

****************************
Fellow Analysts and Associates,

A strong interest has been expressed in regards to forming a volunteer group 
within our program to do service/community work such as Habitat for Humanity 
and etc. 

Many of us already volunteer individually.  It would be nice if we were to 
volunteer together as well on a monthly basis.  In addition to contributing 
to the welfare of the community, this will also give us an opportunity to get 
to know one another better.  

Please respond to Gallin Fortunov via e-mail in order to be included in this 
volunteer e-mail list.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out."
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I'm taking this a
bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in." We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
"Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I'm taking this a
bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in." We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
"Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

> > A chronology of events for Saturday, December 4, 1999, and the early
morning
hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels
7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor
store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot. Awesome day. Not a single cloud in the
sky. About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second
floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the
street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of
Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests
with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the
fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. Again, we hoot
and holler like wildmen. Again, the band doubles back and stops right below
us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
*Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
"Traveler" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play
 what I now call and will forever be remembered as "Cell-Phone Flop Out."
Remember flop out for a dollar? The rules are similar. I tell this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should "flop out" his cell
 phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta
Bowl.
 And then I spoke these memorable words: "And not those damn refundable
tickets, either! You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!" He backs down. He is unworthy. I call Southwest Airlines
and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable. Price:
 $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in shame. I raise my cell phone in
 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of

shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.

on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left

10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good

 triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans. I am KING and these are my
 subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses. I
 RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
 from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.

I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the
end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites, so
that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.  Nebraska is a bunch
of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.

I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been
confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock. I am enraged by this
policy. I ask loudly: "Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,
the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my
coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?" Alas, the answer is no, we were not
winning and we did not score. The largest (by far) cheer of the day from
the
Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel
and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K",
and "A" in the "Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone.  I cheer wildly.

I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too
drunk to form complete sentences. With my last cognitive thought of the
evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in
October, they would be playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona
tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a beer.  *It is warm.

I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk
past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if it's
any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink the
Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.

I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and
that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.

I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and
profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.

I
tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we may
as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going to
kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in the
bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.  Needless
to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out

of
a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lostmy bearings. I
have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I
shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I
attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.  However,
on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid,
leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to myself, "I'm taking this a
bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and
grunting. I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants are
bloody. I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist. I look
like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make
my way for the exits. I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I
merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage. I walk up six
flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the
face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and
collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck. I look around and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my friend in the driver's seat. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up
all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.  I
am too tired to punch my friend. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and

no one is moving. I call my friend a "Stupid cocksucker."
11:58 I am jostled. The truck is moving. I lift my head to look out the bed
of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second
floor. I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility,
and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below. My friend looks at me
like I just anally violated his minor sister. I turn around and pee on the
front of his truck while singing the lyrics to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of beer. I jump from the truck and go from
vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers. I am happy. I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility. We make our way to my
apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of
Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him. We are all going to die
tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet. We decide
it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length
 mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.  We
giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter
his club. "Fellas," he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, "I've
 been working this door for almost a year. I've been working doors in this
town for almost 5 years. And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker mother fuckers than you three. Sorry, can't let you in." We
attempt to reason with him. He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We take two steps in the door and hear
"Last call for alcohol!" I turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat wasn't
that fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..." We order 6 shots of tequila
and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food. We hail a cab to take us the two and
one half blocks to Katz's. The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10 and tell
him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give the hostess $50. We are seated
immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two
orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese
stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all asleep with our heads onthe table. The
waiter wakes us up. We eat every fucking bit of our food. Most of the
restaurant patrons around us are disgusted. We don't give a fuck. The tab is
$112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman. She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

Here is some preliminary research on the Commercial Group's question of 
whether we can have a tariff provision in which shippers pay cash for fuel 
rather than providing fuel in kind.  If you want the attachments (examples of 
other pipelines' tariff provisions) I will send you a hard copy.  Comments?  
Are there any rate case implications I should be aware of?
Just wanted to share this thought with all of you.  
 
 - The Paradox of Our Time.doc

It is because of nights like last night with company such as yours that I 
remain optimistic in the face of statements such as the one attached.
Sorry, I forgot to include you in the last email.  Hope to see you tonight.

Via a quick phone call to Little Woodrow's I was informed that the "steak

Thus, our evening out is on.  See everyone there around 7:30 p.m.  If you

As far a the girls go...I'm afraid I will only be bringing myself.  You know

Via a quick phone call to Little Woodrow's I was informed that the "steak 
dude" (as nstepha has coined him) cooks come rain, sleet, snow or shine.  
Thus, our evening out is on.  See everyone there around 7:30 p.m.  If you

you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing.  
Cheers.Barring weather issues, it would appear as though we are on for Little 
Woodrow's tonight.  I don't believe a definite time has been set as of yet, 
but seeing as how they ran out of steaks last week I suggest we get there as 
early as possible.

Should we be rained out an alternative location will be chosen.With the exception of Sunil no one answered the original question (Do we want 
to go somewhere we can eat?).  Given that the three of you sit within inches 
of each other, I'm going to let y'all discuss the matter and get back to me.  
Anything's OK with me so just let me know what you come up with.   If you get 
stumped I'd be happy to offer some suggestions.Is there actually a fun sushi place?  And do they have Ichiban beer?

Sushi!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Given that tonight's weather conditions may not permit dining alfresco, I was 
wondering if we should come up with an alternative plan.  I think the first 
order of business is whether or not we want to go some place we can eat or if 
everyone just wants to meet up post dinner.  Depending on everyone's 
preferences I have several suggestions.  Let me know your thoughts (regarding 
tonight).Please respond to "C. Scott" <cscott@ala.net>

The quote speaks to so many in such personal ways...Obviously you identified 
with it's message.  Although, I'm not sure about the Dalai Lama comment as he 
does believe in a power higher than himself.

As for myself...

I am still measuring my powers.  They seem to lie in such varied arenas that 
I never know what I will discover day-to-day.

As far as tasting the fruits of my passion, you know what they say...the 
first bite is the sweetest.  And I must say I look forward with great 
anticipation to sitting down at the table when the time is right.

My place in the world is a combination of one of the guys and the ever 
idealistic, eternal optimist (i.e. I see what is and yet still hold out hope 
for more).
 * I don't believe the sentiment in Return to Me was pure fiction.

Given all of this I am very happy.

To be happy you must have taken the measure of your powers; tasted the fruits 
of your passion and learned your place in the world.

Hi Lindy.  Sorry I've not yet set up the meeting on imbalances...I feel I am 
still lacking focus so thought I'd run this by you for your comments before 
inviting people.   
 
First of all, I believe the general topics we wanted to address were:

- imbalance netting & trading
- mandatory use of Park N Ride service for out of balance operators
- hourly determination of imbalances

Is this correct?

Next, the list of attendees:  you, me, Darrell, Richard Hanagriff, Sheila 
Nacey (or someone else she designates).  Anyone else?

As far as timing, I am very flexible, so let me know what works for you, and 
I'll get it set up.
First and foremost you are a father, then a husband and then a poet.

What is my place in the world?


Please refrain from any snide or negative commentary regarding my efforts to 
gain a clearer perspective on life as they are sincere.

To be happy you must have taken the measure of your powers; tasted the fruits 
or your passion and learned your place in the world.

           -- George SantayanaMark, 

  Thanks for still including me in the distribution,  it makes me feel 
important.  However, as I have moved out of the controls group it probably 
isn't necessary to include me any longer.---------------------- Forwarded by Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT on 04/10/2000 05:14

As you will note from the email address, my last name is Scott.  If that is 
not enough information to derive my number I will have to question the level 
of intelligence I had previously afforded you.  However, as I hate having my 
illusions shattered, I'll save myself from possible disappointment and just 
give you the number...ext. 31455.

With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal, 
Order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that 
are now subject to ROFR.  The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering 
gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to 
re-execute current contracts.  The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we 
should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.  In limiting the 
right of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a 
customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely 
that its contract will be at the maximum rate.  Shippers that are not captive 
and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR, 
and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers 
upon expiration of the contract. 
 
In light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the 
ROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.  Such shippers 
would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective 
date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal 
(assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an "as amended" 
basis).  Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to 
make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of 
the contract.  ---------------------- Forwarded by Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT on 04/07/2000 01:11

Hi Susan.  Hope you're feeling okay today.

There was a gas daily deal that didn't pull in yesterday.  I thought that it 
would come in with today's data (thinking it got booked late or something)  
but it didn't.  Could you look into it and let me know where it is.

Thanks,

Carrie

RE:     Southern Advice

ADVICE TO NORTHERNERS MOVING SOUTH:

The following is a pre-approved posting whose purpose is to offer insight
and advice to Northerners moving South.

1.  Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be instructed on how to use
it
shortly.
2.  Just because you can drive on snow and ice does not mean Southerners
can. Stay home the two days of the year it snows.
3.  If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic.  Four men in the cab
of a four-wheel pick-up with a 12-pack of beer and a tow chain will be
along shortly. Don't try to help them. Just stay out of their way. This is
what they live for.
4.  You can ask Southerners for directions, but unless you already know the
positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're better off trying to find
it yourself.
5.  Remember: "Y'all is singular."  "All y'all is plural." All y'all's is
plural possessive."
6. Get used to hearing, "You ain't from around here, are you?"
7.  Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't
understand you, either.
8.  The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted Northerner's
vocabulary is the adjective "big ol," as in "big ol truck," or "big ol
boy."
9.  As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55-mph zone, directly
in the middle of the road, remember: ALL Southern folks learned to drive on
a John Deere, and this is the proper speed and lane position for that
vehicle.
10. If you hear a Southerner exclaim, "Hey, y'all, watch this!" Stay out of
his way. These are likely the last words he will ever say, or worse still,
that you will ever hear.
11. Most Southerners do not use turn signals; they ignore those who do. In
fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a Southern license plate,
you may rest assured that it was already turned on when the car was
purchased.
12. If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking, let alone
eating.
13. The wardrobe you always brought out in September can wait until
December.
14. If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the most
minuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is required at the local
grocery store. It does not matter if you need anything from the store.
It is just something you're supposed to do.
15. Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you purchase
one,it
is positioned directly in front of the house. This is logical, bearing in
mind that the dish cost considerably more than the house, and should,
therefore, be prominently displayed.
16.  Be advised that in the South, "He needed killin'" is a valid defense.

intangible element to a person and very few Texas girls have experienced 
either.

        I think everyone has a different definition of good, some more 
lenient some more stringent.  At least that has been my experience.

good to see your not to pist off at my NY attitude and my dicking around last 
night.
I was just busting balls for the hell of it..cause some of these texans are 
complitely uncultured .....makes me laugh.
And no all girls are not FAT in Houston...but there are not that many hotties 
Vs. the great cities of the world.
It was fun though and i value your good humour and attitude. 

How to define a good girl.....or rather how do we define "good"

It occurred to me last night after you two had left that we never quantified 
what constitutes a "good" girl.  And, given that oversight I may have been 
remiss in stating that Wilson was not ready for said good girl.  Just as the 
opinion of women in Texas differed between you Yanks and the Texas boys at 
the table, I am inclined to believe that our definitions of a "good" girl may 
not be in line.  


P.S. -- A person in their nineties is referred to as a nonagenarian.  (We 
really should have figured that one out last night.)---------------------- Forwarded by Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT on 04/05/2000 04:14

I am somewhat frightened that you would allow yourself to be referred to as 
MaximMan.  While I realize you are a fan of the magazine, professing so too 
loudly may hinder your efforts with the ladies (some of us do have a shread 
of dignity, which that periodical in particular attempts to tear away).  My 
advice is keep it in the closet or bathroom or where ever it comes in most 
"handy".Are you experiencing some sort of split personality today?  Should I start 
referring to you as Ben or MaximMan depending on your responses?"In an age when cloying, dumbed-down Internet "chat" threatens to reduce 
discourse to the linguistic equivalent of casual Fridays, men's-room 
vernacular is seeping alarmingly past its Pine Sol perimeter, infecting what 
is left of conversational civility.  Well-articulated sublimation--which has 
produced some damned fine (and sexy) art, music, and literature over the 
millennia--is no longer the default mode of expression.   That ageless Hot 
Boy, Michelangelo's David, could only have been produced through deft 
restraint.  But try telling that to some WWF instant Adonis with a 
protein-supplement habit."

March 28 and 26 missing deals from yesterday.  This throws our deal count,

In the hospital, the relatives gathered in the waiting room where their
family member lays gravely ill. Finally, the doctor came in looking
tired and somber. I'm afraid I am the bearer of bad news," he said as he
surveyed the worried faces.  "The only hope left for your loved one at this 
time
is a brain transplant.  It's an experimental procedure, semi-risky, and you
will have to pay for the brain yourselves."

The family members sat silent as they absorbed the news.  At length,
someone asked, "Well, how much does a brain cost?"  The doctor quickly
responded, "$200,000 for a female brain, and $500,000 for a male brain."
The moment turned awkward. Men in the room tried not to smile, avoiding
eye contact with the women, but some actually smirked.

A girl, unable to control her curiosity, blurted out the question
everyone wanted to ask, "Why is the male brain so much more?"  The doctor 
smiled
at her childish innocence and then to the entire group said, "It's a
standard pricing procedure.  We have  to mark the female brains down, because
they're used."




You crack me up.  I was going to email you today and tell you about the Bruce 
Cockburn concert.  I am definitely interested.  Don't know what I'm doing 
this weekend, nothing scheduled as of yet so let's try and do something.  
Yes, I am interested in chipping in on a gift, just let me know what and how 
much.  I've heard that I-10 Chronicles CD is really good, I'll have to check 
it out.  Also, do you have Ray Wylie Hubbard's Crusades of the Restless 
Knights?  Every cut I hear from it on KPFT is so good.  Sorry so short with 
the email.  Even though they may be short I should be able to email 
throughout the day.

It was so good to see you last night although when we're in groups like that
I feel like I don't really get to hear SCOOP... did you end up going to
Woody's?

I heard on KPFT this mornig that Bruce Cockburn is coming to Aerial Theatre
May 11th and that would be an awesome concert too... we may have to go to
that one too!  He sings "Last Night of the World" and then this amazing song
that was on around 7:40 this morning that you may have heard... so good!  Oh
my goodness Susan, I forgot to tell you about this new cd I bought
Wednesday... The I-10 Chronicles... I heard about it on KPFT and it is
awesome!!! It's a compilation cd with Joe Ely, Adam Duritz, Willie Nelson
and more... you of all people would love it! :o)

Okay, now that I've filled you in on all I have for now... let me know what
you're up to this weekend...maybe we can veg together...

Happy Friday!

Subject: Take me out to the ...

Oh wait, I can't go to the ball game because I couldn't take a day off from 
work to stand in the Enron lobby (or send my secretary to do it for me).  

For all of you who have managed to snag tickets for tonight's game 
congratulations and you suck.  For the rest of us stuck out in the cold I 
suggest the only viable alternative before us is to drown our sorrows in a 
cold bottle of beer (or two, or three...).  I realize the mass email has been 
MIA the last two weeks.  For some this may have been a welcomed relief.  For 
others there may have been some concern that they had been cut-off from the 
distribution.  At present no one has been removed from the distribution, but 
it is undergoing an audit.  Should it be determined that it is necessary to 
remove an individual from the list for any reason that individual will be 
notified and given an explanation.  If anyone would like to know the causes 
for expulsion you can write to:  I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE CARES IF THERE ON 
THIS DISTRIBUTION OR NOT BECAUSE THE ONLY PLACE WE SEEM TO GO IS WOODY'S 
EVERY THURSDAY BETWEEN 9:30 AND 10:00.

On that note, see you guys at Woody's tonight around 9:30 or 10:00.

The scary thing is I don't think he was kidding.

Lorraine:  here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my 
comments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a 
draft to send around to the usual suspects.  

1.  Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs 
of the acquired capacity.  

 -  I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue 
associated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to 
other shippers.  
 - Net costs will be separately recorded.

2.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access 
to upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to 
limit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to 
other pipeline services?  (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain 
the "no tying" part).

3.  Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?  

 - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction
 - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or 
advantage to any affiliated entity.

4.  Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's 
customers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?  

 - No.  PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods 
in which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM 
shippers should be minimal.  
 - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly 
preferential treatment of TW.

5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing 
open access operations?  

 - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to 
transport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco 
Hub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with 
TW's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's 
tariff.  
 - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS 
(right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on 
TW's system.  
 - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be 
able to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service 
agreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with 
PNM or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of 
likely scenarios.

6.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new 
facilities?  

 - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan 
Lateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of 
prohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the 
PNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives 
available to TW to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable TW to 
transport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to 
delivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding 
the San Juan lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by 
effectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's 
system, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable 
both TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently.

Attached is November's Monthly Report.  I know I'm asking for your revisions 
to it earlier than usual, but with everyone being out during the holidays 
(myself included) we decided it would be easier to incorporate changes you 
make to this report into the Weekly so you only have to update one report.

Denise Lagesse is going to do the updates next week for me while I'm on 
vacation so send your changes and new items to her by Friday, December 
17th.....Thanks....and Merry Christmas everybody......!!!!!





Hey, just wondering how your weekend of golf went.  Wouldn't want to be 
accused of cutting off contact again.  

P.S. -- I got a very interesting response from Plauche following the mass 
email...he is definitely a different chap.You must have too much time on your hands.  The situation has been corrected.---------------------- Forwarded by Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT on 03/30/2000 02:12

Susan,
 I find that you have a midly attractive sense of humor and a cynical side to 
you that separates you from the rest of the tribe.  Its funny you mentioned 
the Astros game.  I was actually thinking of inviting you (since I have two 
tickets to tonight's game and all) but you have turned me down so many times 
in the past I decided to go with a more conservative pick.  Anyhow, since I 
absolutely detest Woody's and all of my bold suggestions for other venues 
consistently gets dissed by the group's brain trust, please take me off of 
this distribution list.  Have a nice day.

kick out of this email.  It's from that guy that is 25 but looks about 40.  
And yet he resurfaces again (read the email at the bottom first then his).

Oh wait, I can't go to the ball game because I couldn't take a day off from 
work to stand in the Enron lobby (or send my secretary to do it for me).  

For all of you who have managed to snag tickets for tonight's game 
congratulations and you suck.  For the rest of us stuck out in the cold I 
suggest the only viable alternative before us is to drown our sorrows in a 
cold bottle of beer (or two, or three...).  I realize the mass email has been 
MIA the last two weeks.  For some this may have been a welcomed relief.  For 
others there may have been some concern that they had been cut-off from the 
distribution.  At present no one has been removed from the distribution, but 
it is undergoing an audit.  Should it be determined that it is necessary to 
remove an individual from the list for any reason that individual will be 
notified and given an explanation.  If anyone would like to know the causes 
for expulsion you can write to:  I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYONE CARES IF THERE ON 
THIS DISTRIBUTION OR NOT BECAUSE THE ONLY PLACE WE SEEM TO GO IS WOODY'S 
EVERY THURSDAY BETWEEN 9:30 AND 10:00.

On that note, see you guys at Woody's tonight around 9:30 or 10:00.

support in determining whether to allow pipelines to hold capacity on other 
pipelines, the more shippers we can get to intervene in our filing, the 
better.You can take me off of the email distribution for FX exposures also.  Thanks.Remember those previous discussions about relaxation?  You know me well 
enough to know that I am not easily offended, and in fact have thoroughly 
enjoyed the preceding banter.  Still, I do appreciate your remembering that I 
am a lady. (I have a bad habit of forgetting.)

It is impossible to imply something when it has already been voiced so openly 
and enthusiastically.  (Tobin, you should watch how quickly you respond.)

Jen, you have no idea how appropriate that email was for me this morning.  I 
spent much of this weekend thinking the exact same thing.  I'm pretty sure 
the Monte concert is on a Saturday night, but I'll have to double check on 
that.  I got to see Mr. Smith Goes to Washington this weekend on the big 
screen at the old River Oaks Theater, it was wonderful.  And, Emily, Katy and 
myself went to Tin Hall Saturday night to see Earl Thomas Connally.  We met 
the three cutest, nicest real cowboys there.  It renewed my faith in the 
opposite sex.---------------------- Forwarded by Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT on 03/27/2000 12:00

No wanting to incur the wrath of Jen for failing to keep you informed.  Monte 
Montgomery will be playing at The Fabulous Satellite Lounge May 6.  
Hopefully, we can make this one.Supposedly my phone is going to be switched over the weekend so I should be 
back in the world of reachable individuals next week.  I'm glad you 
appreciated my observation rather than taking offence.  I was afraid after 
two weeks of silence I may have pissed you off somehow, in which case that 
last email would have 
probably been the final nail in the coffin.  

As far as the new job goes it is looking very promising.  Turns out my trader 
went to college with my brother-in-law, sister, and brother so we have too 
many mutual connections for him to be mean or rude to me.  Even without the 
connections he seems like a pretty cool guy and is very supportive of my 
learning all I can about his book.  Hopefully, after I get the daily routine 
down he'll let me sit with him during the down times and watch him work.

You should definitely try and see the film Saturday and even if you can't 
pull yourself out of bed you should rent it, I really think you would 
enjoy/be inspired by it (at least I am every time I watch it).  I hope things 
are well with you although I am sensing some disenchantment.  If that is the 
case I can give you a few tips on how to overcome and once again appreciate 
your current position in life.  Believe me over the last two months I have 
had ample opportunity to do just that.  Just let me know if I can return the 
favour you once did for me.  

Have fun at y'alls Happy Hour tonight.

P.S.  How was Canada?  I heard through the grapevine you went the other 
weekend.
Do you honestly think Tobin can be a substitute for you?

Main Entry: al?tru?ism
Pronunciation: 'al-tru-"i-z&m
Etymology: French altruisme, from autrui other people, from Old French, 
oblique case form of autre other, from Latin alter
Date: 1853
1 : unselfish regard for or devotion to the welfare of others

We got to talking about you at lunch today.  Rudy mentioned that in effort to 
get your goat he often tells you your not being very altruistic towards him 
by consuming
so much of his time requesting reports.  My understanding is that your 
typical response to this is "I am the most altruistic person."  I am sure you 
recognize the hypocrisy 
laden in this statement.  If a true altruist is unselfish then he would not 
care if his acts are recognized or not.  In fact, the true altruist hopes 
only that his acts benefit
those to which they are directed.  We may have to downgrade you to "concerned 
individual".                       

But given your good-hearted and idealistic leanings I thought you would might 
like to know that the Landmark River Oaks Theatre is going to be showing Mr. 
Smith 
Goes to Washington Saturday and Sunday at 10:00 a.m.  If you haven't seen the 
film it's a black and white starring Jimmy Stewart as an idealistic,

FYI- Neither you nor Nick have been removed from the group email, I simply 
haven't sent one out in the past two weeks.  I will make sure you both 
receive my next 
brilliant composition.  I must say I was tempted to remove you given your 
complaints about receiving all of the follow-up commentary and a lack of 
appearances.





















 Hugo, you can go ahead and remove me from the distribution list as I have 
moved out of the controls group.  Good luck with everything, it has been 
great working with you.The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer 
than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily 
firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for 
consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the 
other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a 
certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able 
to "sell daily firm for a one-year period."  In contractual terms all this 
would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), 
and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I 
see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in 
marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month 
period.)Jason, you can go ahead and remove my name from the email distribution list 
as I am no longer working in the controls group.  I've enjoyed working with 
you and will definitely pay you all a visit when I travel to London this 
fall.  Cheers.

Joel, you can remove my name from the distribution list as I am no longer 
working in the controls group.  I have moved over to gas trading and am 
supporting one of the traders.  It's been great working with you and I'll be 
sure to say hi when I visit London this fall.  Cheers.Mythology

                          Shit: Through the eyes of the Military

                              *An Army grunt stands in the rain with a 35 
pound pack on his back, 15 lb. weapon in hand, after having
                              marched 12 miles, and says, "This is shit!"

                              *An Army Airborne Ranger stands in the rain 
with a 45 lb. pack on his back, weapon in hand, after having
                              jumped from an airplane and marched 18 miles, 
and says with a smile, "This is good shit!" 

                              *A Navy SEAL lies in the mud, 55 LB pack on his 
back, weapon in hand, after swimming 10 miles to shore,
                              crawling through a swamp and marching 25 miles 
at night past the enemy positions, says with a grin, "This
                              really is great shit."

                              *A Marine, up to his nose in the stinking, 
bug-infested mud of a swamp with a 65 LB pack on his back and
                              a weapon in both hands after jumping from an 
aircraft at high altitude, into the ocean, swimming 12 miles to
                              the shore, killing several alligators to enter 
the swamp, then crawling 30 miles through the brush to assault
                              an enemy camp, says, "I love this shit." 

                              *The Air Force NCO sits in an easy chair in an 
air conditioned, carpeted office and says, "My e-mail's
                              out? What kind of shit is this?"

                                  The 5 Scariest Things in the Army! 


                              1. A Private saying, "I learned this in basic 
training..." 
                              2. A Sergeant saying, "Trust me, sir..." 
                              3. A Second Lieutenant saying, "Based on my 
experience..." 
                              4. A Captain saying, "I was just thinking..."
                              5. And a Warrant Officer chuckling, "Watch this 
$%!#..." After reading that did you all of the sudden feel as though your body no 
longer contained any organs and instead there was just a giant pit where they 
all used to be?  I never in my life imagined the intense impact an email 
could have.  They appear so harmless at first glance with no character or 
personality to the font or page, but upon closer inspection they have the 
ability to send you soaring or plummet you to the darkest depths.  

I really don't know what to say about the email.  If I didn't know what 
happened afterward I would have said it was very promising, but knowing what 
I know I must resort to my new tag line that guys in general are just 
confused.  I must say though that his quote was outstanding and if Ben and I 
had any semblance of normal communication between the two of us I would send 
it to him in a heartbeat.  But we don't so I'll just have to enjoy it solo.  

I fear today will be a very boring day so feel free to keep up an email 
dialogue throughout the day.---------------------- Forwarded by Susan M Scott/HOU/ECT on 02/24/2000 07:54

In my never-ending quest to expand myself both culturally and socially I am 
proposing a fun-filled Friday night to those of you who I feel would 
appreciate it most, or at least have any interest what-so-ever.  This Friday 
at 6:30 p.m. Pavel Kogan will be performing with the Houston Symphony at 
Jones Hall.  All of the tickets for this show are being sold at a set price, 
which means that we can obtain center orchestra seats for only $25.00 a 
piece.  My idea for the night is as follows, attend what I'm sure will be an 
outstanding performance, grab a late bite to eat at one of several excellent 
restaurants downtown (Mia Bella and Osteria D'Aldo come to mind) and polish 
off the evening by gracing one of the many hot-spots found downtown (Jones 
Bar, Swank Lounge, Deans, Mercury Room, etc.) with our presence.  Bear in 
mind that my plan is completely open to suggestions from each and every one 
of you.  While I realize such an early show may interfere with some people's 
plans (workout routines, etc.) I am sure things could be rearranged for one 
evening.  Please email back and let me know if there is any interest in such 
an outing.  

"And in the end it's not the years in your life that count.  It's the life in 
your years."  - - Abraham LincolnPart I:  Dress Code for Female FERC Lawyers at FERC Proceedings*

Skirts must be mid-calf length and of a synthetic fabric.
All clothing worn in FERC hearing rooms must be properly aged (12 years or 
more).
No solid-colored garments are permitted.  Exceptions:  mauve, pink, peach, 
teal, harvest gold.
Hair must be fuzzy, multi-colored and must partially conceal the face.
Suntan hose must be worn at all times.  
Open-toed shoes (preferably in a lighter color than the hem of the skirt) are 
preferred.
Those with a flair for fashion are permitted to wear inexpensive animal print 
garments, metallic accessories or clothing with fake fur trim, so as to 
attract attention to one's originality.

*also applicable to female practitioners at the Texas Railroad Commission and 
Public Utilities Commission.Sorry Toby, but honestly this is the first time I've seen such a request.
A lot of things get sent to Susan Scott of ECT by mistake; maybe that is what 
happened?
I would never ignore you on purpose.
I'll call Ms. Lee and give her the correct info.

Subject: Final Draft: GPG Order 637 Rehearing Comments

Thank you for all the comments.  Here is a last draft of our GPG rehearing 
comments.  Please forward any additional comments no later than noon, Friday 
March 10.

Significant changes from the last draft are as follows:
1.  We are asking the Commission to eliminate the peak/off-peak cost & 
revenue study, rather than clarify that the study applies only to excess 
revenues. (p.2)
2. References to the TW Global Settlement have been removed. The reference to 
existing settlements is more generic and included only to preserve our 
rights. (p.4)
3. A new argument on ROFR has been added.  We are asking the Commission to 
immediately apply the new policy that ROFR does not apply to discount rate 
agreements. (p.5-6)
4.Several reporting arguments have been deleted -- masking shipper names, 
clarifying that only senior employee names have to be posted and clarifying 
the Sept. 1 reporting date.  With respect to these last two arguments, we 
have decided that we can interpret it our way without further clarification.
5.New clarification concerning the date for which the lifting of the price 
caps on capacity release is to be implemented.



Hi!   Thanks for the update, it is good to hear from you.  Sorry Grayson is 
being a crybaby.  It is tough being a baby, I think.  How did the doctor's 
app't go?  Bet you are ready for the weekend so Jim'll be around all day.  
Every working mom I know could not wait to get back to the office after 
maternity leave.  I think the daycare arrangement is generally best for 
everyone.  Baby gets a head start on her social life, and the parents can't 
wait to see the kid at the end of the work day!  Most everyone I know is 
raising their kids that way, and they seem to be turning out fine.  Even the 
handful of stay-at-home moms I've met leave their kids with someone several 
days a week, for sanity's sake.

Had lunch with Mema on Wednesday at Treebeards.  I get the impression that 
she's gotten the message that you and Jim don't exactly want her dropping in 
for spontaneous visits, so that's good.  I always enjoy meeting her for 
lunch--for some reason she's always on best behavior, and we always run into 
my coworkers and friends who just think she's the greatest.  Thank God she 
can never remember their names, or she might start calling them for lunch.  

Bill and I saw a play at Diverse Works last night called "Fucking A."  It was 
a take-off on The Scarlet Letter.  I thought it would be funnier but it was 
actually pretty dark.  The bearer of the letter A was an abortionist in a 
strange land working to pay her son's way out of jail.  Despite the subject 
matter it was one of the best plays I've seen in a very long time.  Diverse 
Works is an art space in the warehouse district directly north of downtown.  
(Nancy Littlejohn (Worthington) has her art gallery nearby.)  They mostly 
sponsor dance, dramatic and performance art productions.  A lot of it is 
really over the top, but I've seen some cool things there.  One of my friends 
at work is trying to get me to serve on the board of directors, so I've been 
hanging out there to see whether I like the people.  

Work is driving me nuts, but that's what they pay me for, I guess.

Time to read more FERC cases.  I don't wanna FERC, I just want to bang on the 
drum all day.

Hang in there, and please send more news of little bug!

Love,

Subject: Daily Firm Contract

Please call me if you have any questions.

The term of the FTS-1 agreement is for one day, and automatically renews from 
day to day.
The discount letter provides that the discount applies to the one-day term 
and each consecutive one-day term (if any).  The term of the discount letter 
is typically one month or 3 months.  The discount letter does not obligate TW 
to provide service for more than one day, but as long as the term of the 
service agreement renews, the same discount would apply.  

My point is that if we are already contracting for daily firm this way, it 
should not matter whether the discount is effective for one month or for 12 
months.  

If there is a problem with the current arrangement, we should discuss it.  
Nothing about the way we do these deals has changed since we discussed it 
last December.

I do have a problem or concern with this--  how do we argue it is daily 
capacity and at the same time we agree to rate to be applicable for a year?

Yes, we did revise the language.
Commercial Group's question is whether we see a problem with making the 
discount effective for one year.  I think it should make no difference.

I thought we had worked on some revised language, because we had a concern 
when the agreement indicated the discount was available for the month.  Glen 
was working with you on this I believe.  MK

Subject: daily firm on TW

The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer 
than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily 
firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for 
consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the 
other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a 
certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able 
to "sell daily firm for a one-year period."  In contractual terms all this 
would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), 
and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I 
see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in 
marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month 
period.)










Part II:  FERC Writing Handbook

1.  "WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED" adds a note of authority to your 
pleadings.  In fact, some administrative law judges will throw your pleading 
into the special incinerator marked "Nonconforming Pleadings" (located on the 
west side of the FERC building) unless such language is present.

2.  Pronouns should be used sparingly, if at all.  With few exceptions, 
parties must always be named to avoid confusion, even if it means the name of 
the party will appear several times in one sentence.

3.  The verb "request" may not be used without the word "to."  Example:  
"Pipeline X respectfully requests the Commission to grant its motion."

4.  "In regards to" or "vis-a-via" sound more intelligent than "about" or 
"concerning."

5.  If you are not sure you've conveyed an important point effectively, 
repeat the statement verbatim at various other points in your pleading for 
emphasis.  Additionally, repeating a contractual provision several times in a 
contract will give your client greater rights than if you only include the 
provision once.

6.  Always recite the entire history of the proceeding in your pleading 
before stating the purpose of your pleading.  No FERC staffer ever remembers 
what happens, and the added pages will make your pleading really impressive.

7.  When in doubt, insert more commas.



Thanks.  Lindy and I are going to look at whether any changes will need to be 
made to the pro forma sheets we've filed, and will get back to you.

Subject: EFBH

In discussing the finer points of EFBH Service with our market services 
people, an issue has arisen with respect to allocation of FTS-1 and FTS-3 
capacity.  We are going to have to be able to put FTS-3 and FTS-1 capacity 
into separate buckets for purposes of allocation (that is, allocation due to 
circumstances such as, say, windowing by SoCal, &c.).  Here's why.  If 
capacity became constrained on a given day and we allocated FTS-3 and FTS-1 
together, FTS-1 service would essentially be enjoying the use of capacity 
created by EFBH.  This is all well and good until EFBH cancels at the last 
minute. Then you know what would happen:  FTS-1 would get cut because EFBH 
cancelled.  I am told that this would necessarily happen because once FTS 
schedules, it gets flowing gas rights.  To keep this scenario from happening, 
we feel that FTS-3 will have to be put in its own bucket and not get cut 
unless EFBH doesn't show up.

Obviously, there is more to it than this, and Lindy and I would like to 
discuss it with you.  The systems people can't continue their work until we 
get this resolved.  Can we discuss this on Monday or some other time next 
week?  

Thanks, 
SS
