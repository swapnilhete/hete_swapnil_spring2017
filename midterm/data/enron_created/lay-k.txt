Linda, before we knew that you and Ken were going to the VIP reception, Ken 
had me ask if others could attend in your place.  I did ask and they have 
just called me that Nancy Kinder said that it is o.k. for the Vermeils and 
the Herrolds to attend, in addition to you and Ken.  They did ask if we would 
not spread it around as others have asked and they have not let them.

Oh, but Beau just called that Heather is ill and they are cancelling.  

RosieOn Tuesday, July 25, I am meeting with Molecular Electronics Corp. (MEC) to 
discuss the opportunity for establishing this newly formed company in 
Houston.  For those of you that are not familiar with MEC, they are 
considered one of the premier companies in the area of molecular computing.  
MEC has approached Enron to discuss a possible alliance that would facilitate 
their development and, in particular, location in the Houston area.  MEC 
represents the frontier of computing technology.

I would like to invite you to participate in a working lunch discussion of 
the opportunities and obstacles facing a company that is seeking to change an 
industry.  I would appreciate it if you could join us on July 25  from 11:30 
to 1:30 in EB49C1 for this informal roundtable with the CEO of MEC, Harvey 
Plotnick and one of the founders, Jim Tour.

Will you please let Vanessa Groscrand know if you can attend at 713-853-1769 
or please reply by e-mail to me.

Subject: Solicitation to Past Fathers of the Year


Ken,
  Thank you so very much for thinking of this idea.  It is so timely and
certainly fits with Kirbyjon's challenge. I have spoken with Hardie (who
also edited this letter for me) and we both agree that this would have much
greater impact if it came directly from you, as a past Father of the Year.
As you can see we attributed the information about our shortfall directly
to me, so I am involved in the letter but not doing the solicitation.  If
you are not comfortable with this, just let me know and I will redo the
letter.  I think if you agree to send this out over your signature it would
be enormously helpful.  Please let me know what you'd like me to do.

  Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and continuous support.

As we discussed, the date that Ken thinks is best for the United Way Kick-off 
is August 9 at the conclusion of the Employee Meeting.  He thinks it would be 
fine to do the presentations there and then move on to whatever activity is 
planned.

Thanks for everyone's patience.

Hello Janice:

 I enjoyed your recent e-mail but was sorry to hear about your dad.  It 
sounds as though his health has deteriorated significantly.  These are always 
difficult times.  As I watched my mother and father's health deteriorate and 
ultimately watched them die, it is a very defining time in our lives.  But we 
can be very thankful to have such great parents and to have had the privilege 
to have been raised in such loving homes.

 Sounds as though Eric has done very well as SMSU.  He is joining an 
excellent company.  I am also delighted to hear that he will continue his 
education working toward an MBA.  As we are living in an age where 
intellectual capital is so valuable, it is important for every young person 
to obtain the very best possible education they can.  As to our family, 
within the last ten days our youngest daughter Elizabeth was married to a 
young man from Buenos Aires, Argentina.  They met while they were both 
working on a project as lawyers in Buenos Aires.  They're currently on their 
honeymoon but shortly after returning will be moving from Buenos Aires to 
Miami, Florida.  This past Thursday night our sixth grandchild was born.  It 
was born to our son David and his wife Courtney.  It was a 7 lb., 10 oz.,  20 
inch little boy.  So we now have three grandsons and three granddaughters 
ranging from about 2 years - 4 months down to a few days.  They are a great 
deal of fun.  We are doing quite well.  I am looking forward to seeing Ginger 
"Rees" Copeland when she comes to Houston.  I would be delighted to arrange 
tickets for you and your family should you ever have occasion to visit 
Houston.

 I hope you have a great summer.Thank you for your recent request for Mr. Lay to speak at your conference.  
Unfortunately, do to Mr. Lay's schedule he will not be able to participate.

Thank you again,

Tori L. Wells
Executive SecretaryHi -

Just to let you know that it looks like one day will work.  I want to check 
with Mr. Lay before confirming.

Thanks.

Subject: Meeting with Arthur Levitt in September


 Dear Ken,

 As you know, our next meeting is on Wednesday, July 12 from
3:00-5:30 p.m.  In the next week or so, we'll be sending around a discussion
paper which we hope crystallizes the issues, and we will try to talk to as
many of you as possible before the meeting to go through it.

 Meanwhile, Arthur Levitt has agreed to meet with us in September to
brainstorm on the ideas we've generated and also to give us a sense of some
of the issues as he sees them.  There are three possible dates for the
meeting, which I suggest be in two parts -- first, a meeting among the panel
only from 5:00-6:30 p.m., and then a dinner with Chairman Levitt from
6:30-8:30 p.m.  Here are the dates:

 Could you please let us know which of these would be possible for
you:


  ___________ Thursday, September 14  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Monday, September 25  5:00-8:30 pm

  ___________ Wednesday, September 27 5:00-8:30 pm



 Many thanks,
 Jeff Garten


Hi Liz -

I had a very interesting conversation with Rocky.  He is still in business, 
just finishing up boots for the new President.    Also, I have been called

him!!

RE:??? June 14 Reception 

Recently Charles Miller and David Dewhurst sent you an invitation 
to a reception which they are hosting on Wed. 6/14 at 5:00 PM to be 
held at the Houston Petroleum Club. 

I hope that you will be able to attend that event. 

Under the leadership of Governor Bush and others we have made real progress 
in Education in Texas over the past decade.? Now it is time to take 
the next steps and achieve even greater progress in our public education 
system. 

The Texas Education Reform Caucus is made up of business leaders, educators, 
and elected officials dedicated to finding common sense approaches to 
improving 
education in Texas. 

I would appreciate the opportunity to visit with you on the 14th.

Dear Dr. Lay,
        In my last note, I believe I promised to check on the dates for the
Faculty-Alumni Awards ceremonies in the future.  The University and the MU
Alumni Association have them scheduled for:
        October 26, 2001,
        October 4, 2002, and
        October 10, 2003.
As I mentioned, the nominations are due February 1st of each year, and
attendance at the awards ceremony is necessary in order to receive it.  The
process is competitive, but I would like to proceed with your nomination
this coming winter if the 2001 date is available on your schedule.
        I visited with Mr. Purdy yesterday about a project at the Evans
Scholars House.  He and Mrs. Purdy seem to be doing fine - and enjoying the
spring sunshine!
        I look forward to visiting with you again.  Until then, I am

I am very sorry, but I inadvertantly deleted your e-mail before printing the 
attachment for Mr. Lay.   Will you please send it again?  Mr. Lay's e-mail 
address is kenneth.lay@enron.com

Thanks.

RosaleeGood morning, Kitty -

Ken Lay would like to have the Armada M306 series - "the first ultra portable 
notebook designed for the enterprise".  Ken said to go ahead and equip it 
with what you think it should have.

Please let me know when he can expect to receive it.  Thanks, Kitty.

  Here is the link to the latest commercial laptops on the market,  I will
follow up with the consumer models.

The M300 series are the lightest and the E500's are the all in one but much
heavier.

Dear Rosalee,

The Council meeting in Geneva will take place on 31 August-1 September. As
is a tradition, it will start with a dinner on Thursday 31 August and end
on Friday 1 September at around 3 pm, so that the Council members can still
return home for the weekend.
A detailed agenda and further information will be sent out in the next

I hope that this preliminary information will be of help to you. If you

"Gary Hamel's 'revolutionary entrepreneurship' model represents a
substantial advance in our understanding of what companies must do to
become outstanding innovators.  It should influence not only top management
but also every employee who, indeed, is the CEO of their business life."

Ken,

Received communications from the Texas Department of Economic Development and 
the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce.  Both would like to invite PM Vajpayee 
to Houston during his U.S. visit in September.  The last time that we had a 
PM here was in '94 with PM Rao.  I would like to support this action and 
would recommend that we draft a letter for your signature.  Have discussed 
same with Joe Sutton and have his support.

Jeff, I will definitely show this to Mr. Lay.  However, I had a thought.  Why 
don't you draft what you'd like him to say and then he can make changes to it

Subject: Cougars @ Enron

Ken,
Thank you for the opportunity to meet today at the "Enron Teaching Excellence 
Awards."  It was an indeed an honor and a privilege to finally speak to you 
in person.  Ironically, when I returned to the office today I received your 
interoffice mail concerning the below email.  I certainly understand that you 
will not be able to attend many events as I am sure that your schedule is 
quite demanding.  I believe that this group will benefit substantially by 
knowing that you are aware that it exists and want to support it.  Is it 
possible to send a brief email to UH alumni at Enron letting them know as 
such?  If the alumni see that you support our efforts, they will take an 
increased interest in participating and provide us a solid foundation with 
which to work.  Please provide me any feedback you may have.

As we talked about today, we would like to begin having occasional "brown 
bags" in an effort to get the alumni better acquainted with the university.  
I believe that we should have one with Dr. Smith to promote the image 
campaign, changes at the university, the tier 1 status, etc.  If you could 
make it that would be great but if not that is OK as well.  I will send you 
the date when I have it.

Chet Gladchuk has agreed to work with us to orchestrate a tailgate party on 
Sept. 16th to welcome Dana Dimel in his first home football game.  We will 
have a tent, food, refreshments, football tickets, etc.  I suspect that it 
will be from approx. 4:00 PM to 10:00 PM.  Please let me know if your 
calendar is free.

I am truly excited to have you as alumni and am grateful for your 
approachability.  Please let me stress that I do not expect you to make all 
or even most of our events.  I would just like to let you know what we are 
doing and if you find that you are free, we would love to have you.

Thank you for your time,
Jeff

Subject: Cougars @ Enron

Mr. Lay,
My name is Jeff McClellan and I am President of the "Cougars @ Enron".  We 
are a group of Enron employees that are UH alumni that have banded together 
to form a chartered extension of the Houston Alumni Organization.  We had our 
kickoff event in the 50th floor dining room on March 7th of this year and 
have received substantial interest in our organization.  I wanted to drop you 
a line to tell you not only about us, but also what we are doing.  As of 
today, we have 107 employees that have expressed interest in contributing to 
our group's success. We have several stated objectives:

1. Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships.  
This will benefit the employees as well as the company.
2. Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the 
University of Houston.  This will help to ease education costs.
3. Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university.
4. Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible.

Currently, here is what we have planned:

4/15/2000 The HAO has given us their hall at "Frontier Fiesta".   Frontier 
Fiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good 
family   fun. The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited.

9/16/2000 We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimel's first 
home football game against Army.  We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up 
a   tent, have it catered, listen to a live band, football tickets, etc.  We 
would like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible.  The 
university will   provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision 
Scoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest.

These are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages.  
We anticipate to have more events planned (golf tournament) which I would 
like the opportunity to share with you.  This group is designed to cater to 
its members, the company, and the university and I believe it is going to be 
one of the most successful out there.  To achieve such a plateau, however, we 
need to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike.  To have you as an 
alumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university.  Would 
you consider making several appearances with us at our events?  Your 
participation would greatly increase our exposure and ability to accomplish 
our goals and we would love the chance to honor you as one of our most 
distinguished alumni.  If there are any suggestions that you may have as to 
how to further our group, I would love to hear them.  I understand that you 
are extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your time but this alumni 
charter is something that I truly believe in and I hope you will agree that 
it has great potential.  With you support, we can attain a level of success 
that will set us aside from any other group.

Thank you for your time,
Jeff

Subject: Board Metting Dates



Mike has suggested that we cut back  board meetings to fewer than the eight 
(8) we currently hold.? In order to  give you some background, Linda checked 
other peer companies and the meetings  range from 6 to 8 a year.? 
?
I think that we can cut back to 6,  however it may be more prudent to drop to 
7 this year and first see how it goes  .? The two meetings that can be 
dropped most easily are June or  September.? 
?
June,  because we have the two day strat  plan meeting in July, and Sept. 
because we don't yet have 4th quarter results  and not a lot of new 
information is available.
?
I think that the board meetings take up   an incredible amount of Compaq 
executive time and energy. I would rather have  them concentrate on getting 6 
or 7 meetings right, getting the company back on  track and? increasing 
earnings.? So, my vote is to?recommend to the board that we  eliminate the 
September '01 meeting.? That is a particularly busy month for  many people as 
exhibited by the lack of attendance we had at this past September  meeting (5 
members).? In looking back, we seem to be able to "fill the  house" in June.
?
On the other hand, you all may want to  continue with the number of meetings 
we currently have.? I will await your  reply.

Hi Mr. Garten and Valerie -

We have been working on Ken's schedule.  It is a fairly busy week, but it 
looks like he could do a 30 minute conference call on Wed. at 2:30 p.m. (New 
York time), if that is still good for you.  Please let me know if Wednesday 
is a satisfactory time for the phone call.  That appears to be the only 
window he has next week.

Valerie had already sent the SEC Panel Outline on 4/11, which you attached 
below.  Ken Lay has already seen it.

Re:  the other question that you asked about Ken Lay's name appearing in a 
press release, he said that is fine.

Liz, I have sent an e-mail to our Washington office to ask for assistance in 
obtaining hotel reservations and credentials.  We don't yet have reservations 
for Ken as everything is locked up by the Republicans, but I have been 
assured they will be forthcoming.  We asked for the same hotel as your Dad

Dear Ken:

Night before last I visited with President and Mrs. Bush and suggested that he
give you a call regarding TFA (Technology For All)! I told him that it might
prove valuable for his son's campaign!  When we spoke with Cynthia Sandherr in
Washington a week or so ago, she said that the "Digital Divide" was the 
hottest
topic on Capital Hill.  She had some wonderful ideas on how to spin this so 
that
businesses create the bridge for the divide and not government!  Although we
want to stay nonpartisan with TFA, this would be a wonderful press opportunity
and platform in Washington!

Just thought I should give you "heads-up" in case he asks and please tell 
Linda
I said hello!

Thank you for doing so much for the cause!

Subject: Jeff Skilling does MS150




	

Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the 
camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the 
fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff 
Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.

Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 
350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the 
Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am 
challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain 
amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a 
break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's 
closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat 
pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge 
to this very worthy cause 1-1.

I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top 
money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your 
consideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.

Rebecca,  I just talked to Ken and asked him again.  He said that there had 
been a couple of developments while he was in London, so he wanted to wait 
until he gets back to the office and has a chance to talk to you.  He will be 
in the office on Thursday.

Thanks.

Just let me know.

Mr. Platt -

Ken Lay said that he will approve the $10,000 underwriter costs to be one of 
the five sponsors for the media briefing on March 14.  Mr. Lay has asked me 
to see if Joe Sutton, the Vice Chairman of Enron, might be able to attend.  I 
will pass the information on to him.

Please ask Mr. Radtke to send an invoice to Enron, unless there is some 
better way to handle getting the money to you.

Hi Rebecca -

In fact, the Consul General of Ghana, Jack Webb, has called Ken asking him to 
meet with the Ambassador to Ghana March 10 or 11 when he will be in Houston.  
I had put a message on Ken's messages last evening asking if you could handle 
this if you are available, so hopefully he will say yes - especially after he 
sees your message.

Subject: Ghana

Ken.

I wanted to get back with regarding your question of Ghana.  You might 
remember that Ralph Hodge had indicated to you that you may well be hearing 
from the Ghanaian Ambassador.  Ralph believes that he will try to facilitate 
a meeting between you and Chevron.

We have been working Ghana pretty hard, including the West African Gas 
Pipeline, the Effasu Power Project, a marketing company and a host of other 
possibilities.  We have told the Ghanaians that with what is going on right 
now in Nigeria, the loss of projects in Cote d'Ivoire due to the coup d'etat, 
and the lack of speed in moving forward in Ghana , that we are slowing down a 
bit to determine if we can resolve current projects before taking on 
additional ones.  

Clearly this is a bit of a "cop out".  I am reluctant to tell Ghana that we 
are slowing down generally in Africa because I don't want to hurt the barge 
deal or jepordize the possible resolution of the large snowball in Mozambique 
and there is truth to the Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria issues.  And, of course, 
I don't want to alienate Ghana generally.  I have a good relationship with 
the Ambassador from Ghana, in fact, I just got a postcard from him two days 
ago, and when he returns to the US he has indicated that he will call me.  I 
will deliver this message, hopefully diverting the call to you.  If he does 
get to you first, he won't be upset for you to send him on to me, I don't 
believe.

If there is any clarification, please give me a holler.  I hope the office 
opening has gone well.  I've extracted many a promise from participants to 
drink a pint for me.

Regards
Rebecca

Subject: Prospective Meeting with Jim Harmon, Chairman of EXIMBank, March 15


Ken and Joe
 Jim Harmon, Chairman of EXIMBank will be in Houston March 15 and would like 
to meet with Enron to see where there are opportunities for EXIM to work more 
closely with the company.  He will be accompanied by Jeff Miller VP who 
oversees the finance operations and perhaps Barabara O"Boyle, head of the 
project finance group.  As you know we have done little with the Bank since 
Trakya. We intended to use the Bank for Dabhol 2 but were prevented to by 
sanctions imposed against India.  Joe is now on the EXIM Advisory Committee 
so it would be a good opportunity to sit down with the Bank. 
 I understand that Ken has received a letter from EXIM about the meeting and 
referred it to Joe.  I would propose that Joe lead the meeting with some of 
the regional finance people (parallel the Munoz schedule, but shorter) with a 
brief courtesy call on Ken or Ken could step in for a moment whenever he is 
available.
 I will check with Pam re Joe's availability and follow up with a memo re the 
market window initiative with EXIM where my office is heavily involved.

Barbara, I have advised our Washington office that Mr. Lay will be on this 
conference call at 3:30.  Just let us know the number for him to call.  Thank 
you.

Dad,
I've drafted a Interim Construction Financing document
for the loan we previously discussed. However, I would
like to have it reviewed by Elizabeth Labonowski
(assuming she has handled some of your loans and real
estate interests previously) if you don't mind.
Unfortunately, since my contract experience is
generally in Take or Pay or join venture projects, it
is lengthier than you wanted.
Please let me know if I can have the go ahead to
contact Elizabeth and if you could have Rosalee send
me Elizabeth's e-mail address, that would be very
helpful.
Thanks,

I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this is a hoax:

http://urbanlegends.about.com/culture/urbanlegends/library/blemtax2.htm

Here's an excerpt from the U.S. Postal Service's published response:

A completely false rumor concerning the U.S. Postal Service is being
circulated over the Internet via e-mail.
The e-mail message claims that a "Congressman Schnell" has introduced "Bill
602P" to allow the federal government to impose a 5-cent surcharge on each
e-mail message delivered over the Internet. The money would be collected by
Internet Service Providers and then turned over to the Postal Service.

No such proposed legislation exists. In fact, no "Congressman Schnell"
exists.

Ken,

I hope all is going well at Enron.  I know you and/or your people have been
discussing with Glenn Yago our so-called Emerging Domestic Markets Project.
It is an exciting one and we look forward to Enron's support, involvement,
participation and leadership.  Glenn will be in touch as the project
unfolds.

Now I am contacting you about our upcoming Global Conference, March 8-10,
2000 in Los Angeles.  There are two issues.

First, I am sure you are aware, we are holding our third annual Milken
Institute Global Conference March 8-10, 2000 at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in
Los Angeles. A copy of the program is attached. This year's event will have
a heavy contingent of institutional investors, corporate leaders, and
technology, media and policy people in the audience.  On the program, we
have nine Nobel Laureates, several CEOs of major corporations, and other
heavy hitters.  As you can see, there is a major technology slant to this
year's program.  It will be a great event.  We would love to have some
representation from Enron in the audience.

Second, we are still accepting corporate sponsorship for the event.  I have
attached a copy of our Sponsorship Opportunities brochure that describes the
various levels ($10K - $100K), and the benefits of each sponsorship tier.
This is a great program to be associated with - both high-quality speakers
and a prestigious audience.  Mike Milken and I hope to be able to count on
your organization for support.

We anticipate a global audience of 1,500 - senior people from the financial
sector, business, technology, academia, the policy community and all the
major media.  In just two years, our Global Conference has become a
significant and influential gathering for discussion, debate and networking
on key business, economic, financial and policy questions.

I hope we can count on you.

Hi Liz -

The reason Ken and Linda were trying to reach you from the plane was that 
they had some suggestions for the hotel rooms and wanted you to know their 
preference.  They would like to give the Jasmine Suite that they are 
currently in to the Vittors with a connecting bedroom, to take care of their 
family.

They would like Mark and Natalie to have the end or corner suite that the 
Vittors have.

Ken and Linda said that they would prefer two connecting rooms, hopefully on 
the 3rd or 4th floor.  They would like for the rooms to have the ocean view 
on the North side.  If that isn't possible, it would be o.k. to overlook the 
pool, but they would not really like the south side as it wouldn't be as 
quiet.  The two rooms would give them everything they need, with 2 baths.

They said they can be reached in Switzerland tomorrow.  The Hotel Meierhof's 
phone number is:  41-81-416-82-85, Fax is:  41-81-416-39-82.  They should 
arrive in Davos about 9:00 a.m.

I know you will have a beautiful and wonderful wedding!!  Thank you so much 
for including me on the Save the Date list.  I feel honored!  Unfortunately, 
we won't be able to come.   Our "first" anniversary is June 3, but was 1961!!

Take care and call if we can do anything.

RosieHi Liz -

Will you please give your Dad a call at the office at your earliest 
convenience.

Gary, 
Least I forget!  On N5737 the other day (11/18) Mr. Lay reported to Bill 
Reddick that when his phone (#2 R/H seat) rings and he answers that it 
disconnects on him.  He told Bill that this is the third time he has reported 
this problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.  We checked and there 
is no record of this problem reported recently (we checked back to May 2000) 
on all three Falcon 900's.

Lyndel checked the system and there does seem to be a problem with it 
disconnecting if you pick it up before the third ring.  After the third ring 
it works fine.  That is all I know at this time.  Garrett Av is coming over 
today to check the system.

I know you don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.  I've 
discussed this with Ron and John as well.

Dear Ken: 

As discussed I would appreciate your meeting with the CM even for a few 
minutes at Davos. I will find soem time in ur schedule to brief you for that 
meeting before you leave for Davos.

The CM considers u as a personal friend now that u have arranged for him to 
be invited to Davos. In fact he has also requested you personally whether you 
can arrange a meeting with Bill Gates while he is there. That would probably 
be impossible given everyone's schedule there and my message for that to the 
CM is going to be that eaxctly that... the schedules look impossible to 
arrange that.

However for your meeting, I would appreciate giving us some time.

Regards,
Sanjay

Dear Mr. Misaki:

Dr. Lay would prefer that the pre-meeting continue to be scheduled at 8:30 
a.m. on January 29, as he has conflicts the afternoon of January 28, so it 
would be difficult for him to attend.

Please advise.

World Economic Forum-Mr. Nishimuro's Notes
"What should be the environmental agenda for business in the 21st
century?"

.Introduction
1. Awareness of Environmental Issue
1)   Environmental issue, like Global warming, Excessive use of
natural resources, Recycling, Pollution, is of major significance.
The impact on the business is becoming to increase.
2)   The Kyoto Conference(COP3) defined an international framework
for dealing with the issue of global warming.
(The GHG reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6%
for Japan, 7% for the U.S.A., 8% for the EU)
Specific content for the Flexibility Mechanism/Kyoto Mechanism
(for International Emissions Trading (IET), Joint Implement (JI),
and Clean Development Mechanism(CDM)) will be decided on at COP6,
which is scheduled for November 2000.
     GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying.

2. GHG Reduction
1)   The relationship between GHG levels and climatic change
remains uncertain at present and further research is required.
Policies will have to be devised that take account of developments
in scientific knowledge and opinion and that also maintains
flexibility.
2)   Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances of
each country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures,
economic measures and voluntary measures.
     Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness in business
competition.

3. Energy Conservation
1)   The U.S.A. is the largest consumer of energy. In such a
large, mobile country, much
consumption is accounted for by the transportation sector.
2)   The EU has pushed many advances in environmental protection,
and has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy.

3)   Japan has very limited natural resources, and energy
conservation has been promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s.
As a result, Japan is a leader in making effective use of energy,
and has the lowest level of GHG emissions against GDP.
Japan's policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures.
Industry has supported this by promoting voluntary environmental
plans and other measures.
Japanese industries including Toshiba are to improve the energy
consumption efficiency of their products and use of energy at
their factories.

4. Programme of Industry
1)   Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction of
products and recycling will bring about the effect on manufacturing
cost saving in the long run.

Subject: Final items of the MC



Hello John,
I hope you have returned to normal after the MC!!!  I can only say that it
was a tremendous success, and everyone should be congratulated that worked
on the planning!
Now to the final items.  We are billing everyone for the hotel, golf and
regatta this week and we have a few questions.  The hotel and golf are easy.
However the regatta is a different situation.  When we started this project,
the cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished.  We quoted
$85.00 per person, however the Millennium rate was actually $100.00 per
person.  This would not be such a great problem, however we had 33 no-shows
for the regatta.  This being said, we have two choices.  We bill those that
sailed for an additional $15.00 to make their charge $100.00 which then
leaves us with a negative $3500.00.  Or, we also bill the 33 no-shows for
$100.00 each which puts us pretty close to break even.
In the big picture, there have been some budget cost that were less than
expected and some that were more.  We will have the final budget complete by
the end of next week.
The most important issue, is it acceptable to bill those that sailed $100.00
or do you want us to stay at the original price of $85.00?......Then, of
course, what should we do about the no shows?  Possibly bill them a
cancellation fee or the full fee?  Or, forget and forgive this time?
I am leaving for Paradise tomorrow, however my trusted partner Janelle will
be here until the 20th of January.  We would like to get everything
finalized before she leaves.
Give us your thoughts.

The EX-MC Director

Ken will attend both meetings.

Subject: e-Katz: Chief Kroeker


Over the past week I have heard from many thoughtful and concerned citizens
about their opinions on Chief Kroeker.  About an hour ago, I held a news
conference to release the statement below in response.  I wanted to make
sure you were able to read it in its entirety.

You are a part of my e-Katz list because of your work with me or my
administration.  To be removed from the "e-Katz" distribution list, simply
reply to this e-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail
addresses you use, please include a name and/or company, otherwise we may
not be able to locate the correct entry to remove.  For more information on
the Katz administration, visit our website at
http://www.ci.portland.or.us/mayor.


Statement Regarding Police Chief Mark Kroeker

"I take my responsibilities as police commissioner very seriously.  I have
reviewed this situation with care.  I want to thank those who provided me
feedback either in person, over the telephone or through e-mail.

"The performance of any individual in my administration ultimately rests
with me.  I want to apologize for the concern, pain and fear caused by the
taped comments made years ago by Chief Kroeker.  His taped comments in no
way reflect my own personal beliefs.

"My community and staff discussions, along with reading all the e-mails and
transcripts of all my telephone messages, helped distill my thinking on this
issue to one key question: Can Chief Kroeker separate his personal religious
views from his professional conduct?

"I have determined that he manages his duties without bias and will continue
to do so. His performance has met my expectations.  He is leading the bureau
in a fair, respectful and inclusive manner.  He is moving our law
enforcement efforts to a higher level of community policing.  Therefore, I
have asked Mark Kroeker to stay on as Chief of Police.  He has my strong
support to continue.

"The law provides that all city employees have a right to their personal
religious views.  I have a responsibility to review their employment status
if their actions, as a result of their personal views, impair their ability
to perform their professional responsibilities.

"Many of the arguments raised asking me to dismiss Mark Kroeker because he
is "out of step with Portland" could be used in other Oregon communities to
fire more liberal public officials who are "out of step" with their
community's conservative majority.  My 30-year fight for tolerance goes both
ways.

"Chief Kroeker will have to rebuild trust with many of our citizens.   He
assures me he is prepared to do so.  He told me he would rather help undo
the damage, help me promote tolerance and acceptance of all people, than
just walk away.

"He commits to a strong and sustained positive dialogue with Portlanders who
are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgendered, including those on his staff.
He has already begun outreach efforts and will continue to do so.

"He said he will redouble his efforts to promote respect and acceptance of
all Portlanders and be steadfast and fair in his enforcement of the law.

"He agrees to work with the Cascade Aids Project to serve as a spokesperson
to educate citizens about the fact that AIDS is not a "gay disease."

"He will continue to seek advice from the City Council, the Bureau's Sexual
Minority Roundtable and others to guide additional efforts.

"He agrees to take all this on with all his heart.

"In the process I hope he and we all learn from this experience.  I will
work to turn this negative situation into a positive one: to expand our
sense of tolerance; to promote the notion that regardless of a person's
personal or religious beliefs, one can be an effective public servant; and
to deepen the acceptance of all Portlanders.

"As Mayor, I will do my part and more.  I hope you will join me."

Subject: Re: Lawsuit


Gentlemen;

You may or may not be aware, but each of you has been named as a defendant
in a lawsuit.  The lawsuit has been filed by a Plaintiff who is represented
by one of the law firms which has filed suit against i2 in the class action
lawsuit (i.e. the Nike situation).  The Plaintiff in this lawsuit is a
nominal shareholder and acts as a front for the Plaintiff law firm.

What makes the lawsuit different from the class action is that it is a
shareholder derivative lawsuit.  What this means is that the plaintiff
shareholder has filed the lawsuit against each of you to collect damages on
behalf of i2.  The claim is based on the Nike facts, but the Plaintiff is
claiming i2 has been damaged by your actions.   What is interesting is that
all damages recovered would go to i2.  So why the lawsuit?  The Plaintiff
can recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit.
Derivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of
"tag-along" type of action.

The Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit
on your behalf.  Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm
try and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate
time, i.e. client meeting, during a speech.  Please let me know if you
would like for us to accept service on your behalf.  This is very common
practice.

I will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit.  Needless to say, you are
indemnified for this, i2 will pay for all legal fees incurred to defend you
and i2 does have insurance to cover this matter.

Please let me know of your decision to have i2 accept service on your
behalf.

Thanks

Oh, Gabriella (that is such a pretty name!) -

I apologize for not responding.  The conference details have been a bit 
confusing to us as we didn't seem to have many.  Mr. Lay is scheduled to 
participate in a Ministerial Working Dinner the evening of May 15.  He has to 
give a brief report on his forum session from earlier in the afternoon.  It 
is being held at the Kleber International Conference Centre.  Therefore, Dr. 
and Mrs. Lay will not be able to attend.

Thank you.

Rosalee -- I just wanted to follow up to see if there are any further
questions you (or Mr Lay) have had with regard to the OECD FORUM and IEA
Ministerial sessions scheduled for 15-16 May here in Paris.  The schedule is
as I sent it to you in April -- although there may be some changes with the
events at the Ministerial dinner.  Here, while we are still intending that
Mr. Lay provide a summary of the FORUM session to the ministerial
participants, we may need to re-order the dinner agenda slightly to
accommodate Secretary Abraham's schedule.  We will keep you posted.

I would also appreciate receiving a copy of the CV that you sent to the OECD
for our own files; we are trying to compile a full set of all participants
for use during the sessions.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Jonathan Pershing


Loretta, I really enjoyed being at your table on Monday evening and getting

Subject: EGM - all company meeting

Ken,

Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the 
Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for 
an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within 
EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we 
expect about 500 people.  

We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of 
these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have 
come in a few months.  

I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had 
a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they 
made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone 
we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.

If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way 
in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now 
core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.

Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information 
or assistance.

Mike 

John, Ken said that he does support you extending the offer.

Dear Colette:

 In response to your e-mail concerning the upcoming New Delhi World Forum, I 
would expect that this forum should evaluate the impact of what is happening 
on our project at Dabohl with reference to enticing other foreign 
investment.  As you probably know, the State of Maharastra has been slow 
paying and no paying for the electricity from our plant at Dabohl for 
sometime and more recently both the State of Maharastra  and the Government 
of India have refused to honor their government guarantees on this project.  
We have filed a political force majeure on the project and indeed will be 
moving into arbitration on that and a number of other issues in London in the 
not too distant future.  Again, I believe this will send a very negative 
signal to the market place as to the advisability of international companies 
investing in India.  I would think you might want to build one panel around 
this subject.  

 If there's any way we can be of help, let me know.

Best regards,

Ken Lay

Subject: India Economic Summit 2001, New Delhi 2-4 December


To the attention of:
Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman
Enron


Dear Dr Lay,

When the Minister of Finance of India Yashwant Sinha recently presented the
2001-2002 national budget, it was widely acknowledged as a very ambitious
"dream budget" which puts India on a high growth trajectory. Most key
sectors should benefit from these reforms, which will thus give a new boost
to the country's economic and social progress. As such, the budget was
welcomed with great enthusiasm by the Indian and international business
community.

On the occasion of our India Economic Summit 2001 to be held in partnership
with the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) from 2 to 4 December in New
Delhi, it will be the perfect time to assess the progress of the bold and
extensive measures proposed in the recent budget, how they have been
implemented and how they have impacted the business environment, domestic
industry activity and foreign investment.

As we will soon be preparing the preliminary programme of the Summit, I
would like to take the opportunity to benefit from your expertise and
understanding of the country. I would greatly appreciate receiving from you
any particular topics or issues that you wish to see given priority on the
agenda. Any suggestions of relevant speakers or experts that you may have
would also be welcomed.

I look forward to receiving your response at the above e-mail address and
kindly ask you to copy my colleague Mitra Khoubrou (e-mail:
mitra.khoubrou@weforum.org).

For more information on the 2001-2002 Union Budget, please visit the
website of the Ministry of Finance of India at http://finmin.nic.in/fub.htm

I look forward to hearing from you and hope that you will be with us in
India again next December.

Best regards,

Colette Mathur,
Director,
Center for Regional Strategies
World Economic Forum


Good morning, Jean - 

I understand from Rob Bradley that you are putting together some facts for 
Ken as he is moderator of this panel tomorrow in Austin.  He said that he 
would like some bullet points about basic trend data last five years re:  
natural gas production and oil production in the State.  He also would like 
facts about electricity transmission and any copies of articles about the 
subject.

Thanks.

Subject: Gerald Smith

Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various 
opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham & Company may be able to work 
together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at 
Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since 
reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a 
proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan 
portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this 
money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with 
Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about 
$235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its 
quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the 
Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation 
to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is 
looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be 
reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of 
our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Regards,
Tim DeSpain

Hi Mary Hope -

Ken would like to have the meeting late afternoon on May 24th, if

Dear Ken,

We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week
to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the
White House probably has priority.

Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th.
the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite
some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review
where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement
in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the
Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects
which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal
government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller,
Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering
Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

As always, Mary Hope

Beau, Ken would like to do this if we can arrange it.  He has a video to 
receive the United Way Kneebone Award from Gerald Smith at 2:30 on Monday, 
May 7.  I'm thinking that maybe we could do this video at 2:00 p.m.  That is 
a lot to do two videos back to back, I guess, but there is very limited time 
available and I think the United Way one will be pretty easy.  Will 30 
minutes be sufficient?

Subject: Child Advocates - Harry Reasoner



Ken -
?
Child Advocates'? 9th annual "Pull for Kids  Sporting Classic" is honoring?
Harry  Reasoner.? Lannie Earthman, at Child Avdocates, told me that they  are 
putting together a short video (a tribute to Harry) for?the night of  the 
event.? Harry doesn't know about the video so it will be a  surprise to him 
that evening.? I've been told by Lannie that, at  Macey's request, those 
being videoed are Dr. Ralph Faigan (Baylor College of  Medicine), Steve 
Miller (CEO, Shell), Malcolm Gillis (President, Rice Univ.),  and hopefully 
you.? Baylor College of Medicine is filming and producing  it.? If you would 
agree to do it, they can film you at your office at your  convenience.? It 
probably wouldn't take very long, unless of  course?you had a whole lot to 
say about Harry.? They want to have it  finished in the next couple of weeks, 
because the event is only a month away  (May 19th).
?
FYI, the Family Foundation?has always  supported the event and this year 
contributed $25,000 (the highest sponsor  level).? I don't think that you and 
Mom are planning on attending the event  or anyone else in the family.
?
Let me know if you would be interested in this so  that I can help facilitate 
it.

The proposal is totally satisfactory to Ken Lay.

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL:  HR Committee Approval Requested for Option Grant


In light of Jesse Greene's acceptance of the SVP, Strategy position, we have
re-examined his option opportunity for 2001.  As you recall, we deferred a
decision on his option grant in December 2000 pending a decision on his
status.

Now that Jesse has accepted this new role, we are recommending a grant of
125,000 stock options, which is comparable to the December 2000 grant to
other 16b officers in staff positions.  As a point of reference, below are
the option grants made to 16b officers in December 2000:

Blackmore - 375k
Winkler - 350k
Larson - 275k
McDowell - 250k
Elias - 150k
Jackson - 175k
Siekman - 155k
Napier - 155k
Fox - 125k
Milton - 100k
Clarke - 75k (received additional grant of 175k options upon appointment to
CFO)
Walker - 60k (received 250k new hire options in September)
Robison - 0 (recently received new hire grant)

If you have any questions or concerns about this proposal, please let Yvonne
or I know.  If it is acceptable, please advise and we will provide a
unanimous consent for your signature to formalize.  Thank you!

Thanks.

Subject: RE: for Rosalee - re Mr. Lay's participation at IEA ministerial


Dear Rosalee,

 I would again like to thank Mr Lay for agreeing to take part in both
our IEA ministerial session and in the OECD Forum 2001 - Sustainable
Development and the New Economy.  As discussed, he is to chair the first of
two energy panels at the FORUM; his is titled "Fuelling Sustainable
Development".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI (speaking on
hydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head of the OECD's Nuclear
Energy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister of Energy and
Environment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency).
The panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des
Sciences et de l'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris.

As I believe I noted in our previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is
responsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive
issues related to the energy panels on the FORUM, the OECD is doing the
FORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers
the following note (see below). It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of
logistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as well as information
on any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the chair of the
first energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation -- but
time does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion.
I would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can
keep our files current.

On our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday,
and finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.  While
Mr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background
documents to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out
if you had any "last-minute" questions which I might help answer.

In addition, I note that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris
during our session.  Some of our ministerial representatives are also
planning to bring spouses (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is
coming with his wife) -- do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in
any events during this period with any of these others?  If you let us know,
we would be happy to make arrangements.

Also, please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we
might facilitate their logistics.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes,

Jonathan Pershing

Subject: Final Draft -- SEC Report on Valuation


  Attached please find the final draft.  Tim Koller and I hope
it reflects all the changes suggested on the last conference call.  Of
course, we will never be able to satisfy everyone to the last detail, but I
think we came as close as we will get.

  There is still some proof reading and minor editing to do,
and we are working on that even as we send this off.

  To the best of my knowledge there may now be two "individual
views"  to go into what is now Attachment D.  Len Baker may feel that the
language on Safe Harbor doesn't go far enough.  Baruch Lev feels that the
SEC should not only issue a "concept release" to solicit broad public
comments on a "supplementary framework for reporting intangibles," but it
should create a task force to do the work.  (Most of the group feels this
approach is too close to asking the SEC to mandate change.)  Baruch also
feels that in relying so much on voluntary disclosure, we are exaggerating
what companies will, in fact, disclose. My suggestion, Len and Baruch, is to
write a paragraph or two for Attachment D, if you wish.  Hopefully, both of
you will begin with a sentence supporting the report in general, but if you
feel strongly that the report doesn't reflect all your views, please do
state them for the record.

  Before we schedule a final call for last minute details,
etc,  I'd like to request an e-mail, fax or phone call from each of you
letting me know if you can sign-off on the report.  I'd appreciate this by
Monday, April 16th.

  Thanks a million.

  Best regards,
  Jeff

Subject: Re: Board opportunity



Mr. Lay,
?
Your assistant contacted me a couple weeks back with the message that the  
attached was not an opportunity you could consider at this time.? Thanks  
very much, though, for taking a look at it.
?
I have one follow-up question for you -- could you recommend another Enron  
executive that might be a candidate for such an opportunity?? 
?
To help you answer the question, the company is Juno Online?Services,  
Inc.?(NASDAQ: JWEB), a leading US ISP.? Juno is very interested in  working 
with (and in advanced-stage discussions with) companies in the energy  
industry and working with them on strategic telecommunications and marketing  
partnerships.
?
Information about Juno is available at "About Juno" on Juno's Web site 
http://www.juno.com.? I've also attached an  executive summary to update you 
(or the relevant person at Enron) as to the  current status of Juno's 
business.
?
Thanks very much for your assistance, and I hope that this message finds  you 
well.
?
Best,
?
Toby
?
Executive Overview of?Juno --

The company finished 4Q00 w/ $56MM in cash.? Total net loss for 2001  was 
projected to be $10-$25MM, as the company focuses on billable services,  
continues to reduce expenses, and looks to develop advertising and other  
ancillary revenue streams.? The company is confident that it can meet  
or?beat the loss target and made explicit statements that on-hand cash  
resources are "more than adequate" to get the business profitable.? The  
company has not publicly given a time-line for profitability to maintain  
flexibility.  
The company controls one of the largest dialup subscriber audiences (4MM  
active subscribers as of 4Q00, 850K of whom are billable) on the Internet  
today and is the 4th largest US ISP (after AOL, ELNK, and MSN).  
2000 revenue came in at $114MM, 65% of which was derived from subscription  
fees and 35% from advertising.? 2001 revenues are expected to come in  
between $100MM-$120MM, with the revenue mix moving toward 80% subscription 
and  20% advertising due to increased focus on billable services and the 
soft  Internet advertising markets.  
Juno has announced broadband agreements for its Juno Express product  
covering all mainstream broadband transport platforms -- AT&T Broadband,  
Time Warner Cable, and Comcast (cable); Covad (DSL); Hughes (satellite); and  
Metricom (wireless).  
The company has announced wireless distribution agreements for it's Juno  
Mobile product with Palm and Sprint PCS.? Other agreements are likely to  be 
forthcoming.  
The company has powerful propietary technology assets that give it a  
competitive advantage.? The company has launched (internally but not  
publicly) a new business unit -- Juno Solutions -- to investigate the  
opportunity to license these technology assets to third parties both  
domestically and internationally.?  
The Juno Virtual Supercomputer Project represents another example of  Juno's 
efforts to develop ancillary revenue streams.? This distributed  computing 
initiative aims to leverage unused computer processing power from  Juno's MMs 
of subscribers, aggregating it for sale to biotech, pharmaceutical,  and 
computational chemistry firms.?

Western State Power Forum: May 22 and May 23

Plans are proceeding nicely for the Western State Forum on May 22 and May
23.  We have an outstanding group of confirmed speakers and panelists
including many individuals that I assume you know as colleagues and friends.
I will be sending you more information on the Forum in the next few days. I
am going to send you the preliminary agenda  this morning.

You will be speaking at a critical time in the Forum; that is, just after
panels on power problems and polices and just before the final session
linking power and energy strategies to environmental objectives. It would be
great if your talk to the participants in the Forum could help them see the
relationship between power and energy related objectives and environmental
issues including GHG emissions. You should feel free however to focus your
talk in a manner of your choosing. Again, I will send you the prelim. agenda
soon.  Could you send me a title however for the final agenda's purposes?
We hope to print the final agenda later this week.    Thank you.

Dear Ken,

We regret that your schedule did not permit you to visit with us this week
to discuss the Center's Global Change Program.  We do understand that the
White House probably has priority.

Rosalee indicated that you are available to meet at the Center on May 24th.
the day before the Board of Trustees meeting.  May I suggest that we invite
some members of the Steering Committee to join us on the 24th to review
where we are, the political environment, and continued Center involvement
in this program area.  As you are aware we have had discussions with the
Turner Foundation on a Leadership Forum and have developed several projects
which have each received partial funding commitments from the federal
government or private foundations.    Paul O'Neill, Tim Wirth, Bill Miller,
Teresa Heinz and Michael Oppenheimer are my suggestion of Steering
Committee members to join us.  Please give me your thoughts.

As always, Mary Hope

Good morning, Liz -

I left a message at your home this morning that your Dad would like to speak 
with you when you have a chance to call.

p.s. - P. L. and I did early voting the first Saturday available!!  It was 
such a good feeling as Tuesdays are tough with trying to get to the office 
and leave in time to vote!!

Subject: Get out the Vote


Dear Friends and Family,
We are down to the wire and the race couldn't be
closer. Every vote counts, even those of you in Texas.
Please, remember to vote and go early, polls open at
7am across the country and close at 7pm but don't put
it off until 7pm as there could be lines and the
supervisors are not required to keep the polls open
after 7pm for those in line.
Remind your friends and family to vote and if someone
needs transportation to the polls, give them a ride or
call your local Victory 2000 office (Republicans) or
your local Democratic campaign office, they will have
people available to transport people to the polls.
Keep an eye out while you are at the polls for
electoral fraud and report any suspicious activity
including inappropriate campaigning to the poll
watchers at the polls. The Democrats and the
Republicans will have representatives at most of the
polls, let them know if there is suspicious activity.
Finally, if you have time, call your local offices and
offer your time to make phone calls to encourage
people to get out and vote, pass out leaflets, or to
be available to help prevent of voter fraud.

Finally, enjoy the evening and watch the results come
in. There are election watch parties everywhere!!!

Just one more day (and no more mass political e-mail's
from me and everyone else)!
Take care and VOTE!
Liz

Subject: GOOD NEWS!...and TFA Board meeting


Gentlemen,

Technology For All (TFA)received today our 501(c)(3) exemption letter
from the IRS.  This letter gives us the opportunity to vigorously
pursue new funding opportunities and also validates what we have known
all along. TFA is a charitable organization serving the underserved in
communities across the US.

We thank Jack Clark, our general counsel, for his arduous pro-bono
legal work over the past 15 months that helped make this happen.
THANKS JACK!!!

On another note, each of you should have received word from Rosemarie
Foster, TFA's Administrative Assistant, regarding a Technology For All
Board meeting scheduled for Tuesday, May 8, 2001 at the University
Hilton on the University of Houston Campus.  The meeting will take
place at 2:00 PM and conclude by 3:30 PM.  It will take place in the
context of an all-day Technology For All sponsored conference "Digital
Divide: A Call to Action".  Each of you will receive an complimentary
invitation to the activities of the day.  Ken Lay will be hosting a
CEO breakfast at 8:00 am.  Our purpose there will be to tell the TFA
story and invite the CEO's present to make a commitment to help TFA
eliminate the digital divide across Houston and beyond.  At lunch,
Greg Priest, CEO of SmartForce, will be speaking. SmartForce recently
gave TFA access to all its online eLearning content.  This gift will
allow TFA to provide workforce training opportunities to half a
million persons over the next three years.  We will thank SmartForce
during the luncheon for their enormous gift which has a retail value
that could be as high as nine figures (depending on the number of
courses utilized).

Regards,

Will

      mation


To:  Bruce LaBoon, Steve Miller, Charles Duncan, Ken Lay, Steve
Letbetter, Dan Smith, Kelly Frels, Ed Galante, Jim Edmonds, Jim Kollaer

The purpose of this email is to provide additional detail to follow up on
the phone call each of you received on Friday, checking availability for
dinner with Congressman DeLay and others on Friday, April 6th.

BACKGROUND  During the last week of February, BCCA and Partnership leaders
met separately with Congressman DeLay, Congressman Joe Barton and with two
top staff members of Mr. DeLay, in order to update them on our extensive
activities aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance.  Pursuant to those
meetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be
held in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area
on
that day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman
of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House
Committee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has
oversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and
interaction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.

APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's
congressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local
officials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship
channel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.
We are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.

He has asked to end the day with a "small dinner with CEOs" to have a frank
discussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called
your office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he
and the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in
addressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we
also invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.
DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will
obviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and
advise
on strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in
attendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in
advance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before
or
after the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.

RSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim
Edmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan
and Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan
Smith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.
We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies
to
attend the dinner.

My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and
to arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at
a
board member's home nearby.

I trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the
Partnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with
any questions you may have.  Thank you.

Alliance Activists Can Make a Difference

As the country deals with a mounting energy crisis, the Department of Energ=
y
(DOE) may be planning an estimated 30-35 percent cut in the energy
efficiency and renewable energy research and development programs budget.
The Alliance calls on all responsible citizens to  encourage the
administration to do the right thing.  Becoming an Alliance Activist is the
first step.

Senator Bingaman, Democrats, Introduce Centrist Energy Bill

Senator Jeff Bingaman (NM), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee and Chair of the Alliance to Save Energy,
introduced comprehensive legislation to shape the nation's energy policy.
``If we want to tackle [our energy] problem[s] head-on, we need a
comprehensive plan that commits to increasing domestic production and to
using energy more efficiently throughout the economy.  I believe this
legislation sets out that plan," Bingaman said.

Secretary Abraham Looks for Energy in Wrong Places

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, addressing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
noted:  =01&America faces a major energy supply crisis over the next two
decades.=018  But Abraham, like President Bush, is looking mainly to increa=
se
our supply of oil, coal, and natural gas, rather than approach both the
supply and demand sides of the issue.  Secretary Abraham mentioned energy
efficiency only once in his entire speech, even though a reduction in deman=
d
is the quickest, cleanest, cheapest (and most reliable!) energy source at
our disposal.

Democratic Task Force Weighs in on Bush Budget

Last week, House Democrats threw their hat into the ring as the Democratic
Caucus Energy Task Force held a news conference decrying Bush Administratio=

intentions to cut energy research significantly in their FY 2002 budget.
The Alliance is quoted in their report, which emphasizes the role of
research and development in providing long-term energy solutions.

Senate Hearing Examines Energy-Environmental Relationship

Alliance president David Nemtzow testified at a March 21 Senate Environment
Committee Subcommittee hearing on the relationship of energy policies and
environmental policies.  Nemtzow pointed out that energy efficiency is now
our nation=01,s second largest energy source.  He also offered a series of
recommendations for the Senators simultaneously to promote energy and
environmental goals.

IPCC: Energy Efficiency is Key in Mitigating Climate Change

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released the third and
final volume of its Third Assessment Report on climate change, which
examines climate change mitigation strategies and places a heavy emphasis o=
n
using energy wisely. The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,
transportation, and industry could account for more than half of the
potential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas
technologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=
d
power play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant
emissions. And "low-carbon energy systems," such as renewable energy, can
also make an important contribution. Perhaps equally important is the
finding that there is "no single path to a low emission future."

Barriers to Energy Efficiency In Public, Private Organizations

There is a gap between the opportunities for cost-effective energy-
efficiency investment identified in energy models and the levels actually
seen in practice, according to SPRU, a science and technology policy
research group in England. The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a
series of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden
costs, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies from
operating efficiently.  SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of
this gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through
improved energy efficiency are to be successful. These policies must succee=
d
in the context of liberalizing energy markets and increasing interest in th=
e
development of a broadly based energy service industry.

Dallas Cleans the Air with the IECC Energy Code

The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) voted this month to
adopt the 2000 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) for the Dallas
region.  This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more
than are built in 42 states.  One of the main reasons for adopting the code
is the area's commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the
Texas state plan for controlling smog.  Since the IECC contains a new
standard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=
g
energy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that
serve the air conditioning load.  The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=
e
Texas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG
staff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=
e
Project and Alliance Associates.

Energy Efficiency Facts Even Children Can Understand

A vacant house at 55 Fahrenheit uses more energy for heating than an
occupied one at 68 Fahrenheit, according to GPU Energy.  The activity in an
occupied house radiates a certain amount of heat and some of the energy
users in your home are still operating while you areaway. Designed
specifically for teachers and students, the GPU website features
energy-related games, activities, experiments, downloadable teaching

Subject: Dinner with Tom DeLay and others on April 6th -- additional infor 
mation


To: Bruce LaBoon, Steve Miller, Charles Duncan, Ken Lay, Steve
Letbetter, Dan Smith, Kelly Frels, Ed Galante, Jim Edmonds, Jim Kollaer

The purpose of this email is to provide additional detail to follow up on
the phone call each of you received on Friday, checking availability for
dinner with Congressman DeLay and others on Friday, April 6th.

BACKGROUND  During the last week of February, BCCA and Partnership leaders
met separately with Congressman DeLay, Congressman Joe Barton and with two
top staff members of Mr. DeLay, in order to update them on our extensive
activities aimed at federal Clean Air Act compliance.  Pursuant to those
meetings, Mr. DeLay's office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be
held in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area on
that day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman
of the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House
Committee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has
oversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and
interaction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.

APRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay's
congressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local
officials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship
channel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.
We are working closely with Mr. DeLay's staff on all these matters.

He has asked to end the day with a "small dinner with CEOs" to have a frank
discussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called
your office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he
and the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in
addressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we
also invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.
DeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will
obviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and advise
on strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in
attendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in
advance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before or
after the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.

RSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim
Edmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan
and Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan
Smith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.
We will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies to
attend the dinner.

My current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and
to arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at a
board member's home nearby.

I trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the
Partnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with
any questions you may have.  Thank you.

Subject: Duchess of Northumbria's request

Ken

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite "no".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Colin

Subject: Dornbusch on Income Inequality and Pricing AIDS Medications to a  
Human Scale


Dear Dr. Lay:

New this week on www.TheGlobalist.com:

RUDI DORNBUSCH ON INCOME INEQUALITY
Poverty is bad -- but income inequality is not. MIT Professor Rudi
Dornbusch makes the argument that the development community
should not confuse inequality with poverty -- even though at the
bottom they might feel the same.

Coming Monday: A New Globalist Paper
PRICING AIDS MEDICATIONS TO A HUMAN SCALE
In a scramble for good publicity, pharmaceutical companies have
started a downward bidding war in pricing AIDS medications for
African markets. To add a much-needed measure of fairness to
the process, we propose a better alternative -- adjusting the price
of treatment to per-capita GDP.

Best regards from Washington,

Stephan Richter

******E-NEWS THIS WEEK*******

OPEC ANNOUNCE 1M BBL/D CUTS
Geneva - OPEC members agreed further production cuts this week, announcing a
further 1m bbl/d decrease in member outputs. As a result oil prices pushed
slightly higher with NYMEX crude trading at $26.80 and IPEC crude trading at
25.06. OPEC ministers have indicated that members have highlighted $25/bbl
as a price that they feel comfortable with.The decreases per country were as
follows:

Algeria - 32,000
Indonesia - 52,000
Iran - 146,000
Kuwait - 80,000
Libya - 54,000
Nigeria - 82,000
Qatar - 26,000
Saudi Arabia - 324,000

Total - 1,000,000


ENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP
Rabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham,
Group General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of
ONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a
petroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB
(11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three
exploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit
Offshore area.
Energy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum
(co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the
Tiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy
Africa's second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the
first being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity
bringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km.
Andrew Windham, said, 'the country has all the characteristics offshore
which make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is
very much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the
moment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.'
For further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum
Bulletin.


REPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY
London - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during
exploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli,
produced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release.
Repsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV,
TotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area
in May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and
production sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The companies
currently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said the
company.


AHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC
Tripoli - Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed
has been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he
had been removed from the position. Representing Libya at the OPEC
conference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri has been appointed as
Deputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will comfort foreign
investors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already slow
ratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of
blocks offered by NOC in late 2000.

*****MARKET ANALYIS REPORT NEWS*****

ALGERIAN OIL AND GAS REPORT
Approximately 90% of Algeria's crude oil exports go to Western Europe, with

products. Specifically, the Report will provide you with a complete analysis

MENA POWER
23 & 24th April 2001, Crowne Plaza Hotel, Dubai
For further information visit
http://www.smi-online.co.uk/middleeastpower2.asp

The timing of this conference couldn't be better as the Middle East and
North African region gears up to offer further independent power projects.

SMi forthcoming conference titled Middle East North African Power, taking
place 23rd and 24th April 2001 aims to bring together all levels of
participants to explain their understanding and thinking for the future of
Middle East and North African power development.

Many countries experience blackouts and electrical faults on a daily basis,
governments in the Middle East and North Africa are now increasingly pinning
their hopes on the Independent Power Project run in conjunction with major
International investors to solve this problem.   Relaxation of Middle East
law has allowed outside investment and many see this moving the Middle East
power industry towards privatisation.

Key Speakers at this event include:
* Engineer Mahmoud Al-Ees, Head of Planning Studies, Ministry of Energy and
Mineral Resources - Jordan

As a subscriber to our MENA E-News service, I would like to highlight the
following speaker, chairman and workshop leader opportunities available at
our Algeria III conference:

ALGERIA III
4 and 5 June 2001, Algiers, Algeria
A review of SMi's Algerian Management Report can be found on:
http://www.smi-online.co.uk/algeria.asp

Our conference division is currently organising an event to examine
Algeria's place in the oil and gas environment.

We are looking to bring together a key audience of specialists, economists,
academics as well as politicians and key decision-makers and would like to
hear from anyone interested in participating in this conference as a
speaker, chairman or workshop leader.
Mailto: wparker@smi-online.co.uk

Topics we are looking to tackle include, but are not inclusive of:

Examining Algeria's petroleum code
Algeria's role in the North African region
Algeria's oil and gas industry
Infra-structure developments
Financing and operating issues
Case studies of key Algerian oil fields
Algeria's licensing rounds and how to succeed
Legal issues
Political and operational risk issues

This conference is taking place on the 4 - 5 June 2001, in Algiers.
A review of SMi's Algerian Management Report can be found on:
http://www.smi-online.co.uk/algeria.asp

The Aims & Objectives of the Conference

Algeria has always attracted a large amount of interest from the
international oil and gas community.  With a new licensing round under
discussion and petroleum code under review, this conference aims to act as a
forum for all aspects of the oil and gas industry to come together and
discuss the future development of Algeria's oil and gas sector.  Moving away
from the traditional investing in format of conference, this forum aims to
look at specific field studies and also the future markets and developments
within the Algerian oil and gas industry.  It will focus on the commercial
opportunities that exist in helping Algeria reach these markets and allow
for strategic analysis of the impact of this supplier.  It will examine
current MENA energy flows and how they might look in the future with Algeria
asserting its role as the Mediterranean's major producing nation.

Hi Colin -

Ken Lay asked me to advise you that this is fine with him.

Subject: Duchess of Northumbria's request

Ken

Thanks for sending me the request from the Duchess of Northumbria for help 
with her garden project.  I have discussed this with John Wakeham and our 
view is that unless you have any other reason for helping with this, we 
should say a polite "no".

The background is summarised on the attached briefing note from Mike O'Neill, 
Managing Director of Lurgi Invent.

Alnwick Castle is several hundred miles out of the Wessex region so it really 
is difficult to justify any Wessex help.  Lurgi Invent has done a little work 
for the Duchess in providing water features for the garden.  However, this 
business currently loses o1 million a year so we would be reluctant to see 
any sponsorship out of Lurgi Invent.

Given the nature of the project, the approach from the Duchess and the fact 
that she can clearly afford to pay for it herself, we really do believe no is 
the right answer.

Please let me know if you want any further information or if you want me to 
correspond direct with the Duchess.

Best wishes.

Colin

Subject: New NBR Publication on "Japan's Energy Angst"


NBR is pleased to announce the publication of NBR Analysis,
vol. 12, no.1, "Japan's Energy Angst and the Caspian Great Game,"

U.S.-Japan Relations and former special advisor to U.S.

keep in mind that your objective should be to provide a succinct, but 
thorough assessment of the investment that will inform a discussion on how to 
best add value and manage the investment going forward.

Hi Jonathan -

E-mail is great.  I have copied Tori Wells on this also, as she works 
diligently on Dr. Lay's itineraries and Rob Bradley, who works on Dr. Lay's 
speeches.  We have virtually no information about the OECD Forum or the IEA 
Ministerial session except dates - May 15-16.  We have made reservations for 
Dr. & Mrs. Lay at the Bristol Hotel.  

We look forward to hearing from you.

Rosalee --  I was given your name by Bill Ramsay as the person responsible

From the IEA side, I have been tasked with the responsibility for
co-ordinating not only parts of the Ministerial session, but also the
preceding OECD Forum -- in both of which Mr. Lay is scheduled.

I am hoping to be in closer communication with you to walk through our
current planning for these meetings, and to make sure that all our i's are
dotted and t's are crossed as we move toward May.  Please let me know
whether e-mail or a telephone call would be best.

I look forward to hearing from you.

With reference to contacting the appropriate people representing Enron in

one of these individuals could entertain a discussion of how we might be able

Thank you for making yourself available this afternoon. We want to apprise
you of recent developments and our planned responses.  The regular Board
Meeting is scheduled for next week. This may not be required in view of the
discussions we'll have this afternoon.  We'll confirm this afternoon whether
the Board Meeting is required.

I am disappointed that Joe Grundfest will not be able to join us at our next 
Advisory Council meeting.  However Tom Campbell sounds like an excellent 
alternative.  Would you please contact him and see if he might be willing to 
join us for the next meeting and talk about the subjects you suggested.  
Incidentally, we're happy to pay an honorarium to any of our guest speakers. 

I think I should pass at this time on inviting Spence Abraham to join us for 
dinner.  First, I believe it would be virtually impossible for him to do that 
at this point in time.  But second, many people are already blaming me for 
being the real energy policy maker in the new Administration and I would just 
as soon not feed that speculation.  

Look forward to seeing you.  

Warm regards,

Ken

Subject: Grundfest


Joe and I hve had several conversations trying to work out his schedule, but
his classes plus moving his parents from NYC to California at that time make
it impossible for him to come, although he would very, very much like to do
so.
I would suggest that we invite Tom Campbell, the Republican congressman who
just lost his shot at the senate against one of the two women (I forget which
one, left or lefter) and who is again teaching at Stanford Law School. He is
brilliant, and we could give him the topic of "Enron and Market-Regulatory
Failure: What Are The Constraints on Its Behavior? Where Do the Risks Lie in
the Future?" Or some such thing.
I will read When Genius Fails in the next few hours and decide about its
author.
What would you think of having Spence Abraham to dinner, and moving Bill
Kristol to the morning if Spence can come?

Freedom of Press 'under threat' in Russia, campaigners claim

Russia's provincial media is struggling to maintain its freedoms in the face
of politically motivated assaults, campaigners claim.

Oleg Panfilov, chief of the Centre for Journalism in Extreme Situations,
said: "A new state propaganda machine is being created in the federal
districts, with new state-run newspapers, new state-run news agencies, new
state-run TV channels."

Fyodor Penkin, chief editor of the Volga Times, who survived a shotgun
attempt on his life earlier this year, said: "Ten years ago, when I was
creating this newspaper, I felt for the first time that I can write freely.
Now this child I have created is dying before my eyes."

Media's role in Ghana's presidential election praised

Ghana's acting ambassador to the US has offered a glowing account of the
role played by his country's media in the recent presidential election.

Francis Tsegah said radio in particular played a significant part in
ensuring the success of the election - Ghana's first multi-party one.

He said:  "The press covered the parties and were able to send information
to the public in such a way that by the time you had the election there was
no longer any question of the media being biased towards one party."

The election was won by opposition candidate John Kufuor.

husband were "na<ve".

Malaysia increases pressure on media

Malaysia has increased pressure on both foreign and domestic media, by
branding people involved in award-winning news site Malaysiakini.com
"traitors" and delaying the distribution of the latest issues of Asiaweek
and the Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER).

Prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said of Malaysiakini: "People who love
Malaysia would not support Malaysiakini. Previously people would say
traitors but these people really behave like traitors, asking foreigners to
harm their own country."

Two Asiaweek issues and one of FEER - all carrying articles on Malaysia -
were stuck in distributions depots, and FEER Managing Editor Michael
Vatikiotis said: "We have no indication as to whether this is just a one off
or part of a policy. We have had no official communication."

Asiaweek is part of the AOL-Time Warner stable, and FEER part of Dow Jones.

Taiwan vows to safeguard free speech over controversial book

Taiwan's President Chen Shui-ban has vowed to safeguard the island's freedom
of speech as a row over a controversial Japanese comic book continued to
divide the state.

The book claimed that many Taiwanese women, forced to act as sex slaves to
Japanese soldiers during World War Two, were volunteers. Some politicians
demanded the cartoonist be denied a visa to visit Taiwan while others
insisted that he be allowed his freedom of speech.

BBC's Sambrook pledge to "get below the hype"

BBC News director Richard Sambrook has vowed to improve the quality of his
empire's output by better integrating its disparate parts, and "getting
below the hype".

In an interview with The Times' media editor, Ray Snoddy, Sambrook, who
officially takes the director's chair this week from the departing Tony
Hall, says he is running a "fantastic operation". But, he admits, it
"misfires slightly as we go down the road. We do not quite pack the punches
that we ought to".

Sambrook says he has discussed how best to coordinate journalists in the UK
regions, and World Service, with senior BBC executives.

Broadcasters face curbs in Singapore

Foreign broadcasters who "engage in the domestic politics of Singapore"
could soon face restrictions.

Information and Arts Minister Lee Yock Suan said he was set to introduce a
bill that would allow the government to restrict distribution of a broadcast
service if the company was deemed to be meddling in the city-state's
internal affairs.

Singapore's Newspaper Act can ban distribution of a newspaper or magazine
and has been used against The Economist and Asian Wall Street Journal, but
up until now broadcasters have been left alone.

Lee said foreign media operated in Singapore as a matter of privilege, not
of right.

He added: "Our aim is not to ban information but to restrict subscriber and
advertising revenue to an errant channel."

Australia's ABC must decentralise to lessen Sydney bias, MD says

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation must decentralise both staff and
activities to prevent it from becoming a Sydney mouthpiece, managing
director Jonathan Shier said.

Shier said that by June 2003, the ABC wanted to increase its
non-news/current affairs production in centres other than Sydney or
Melbourne by 40 percent.

He also said that the internet had its place within media and should not be
sidelined just because of the recent dot com gloom.

Unions claim that the decentralisation talk is just a "stalking horse for
getting rid of staff".

Journalist Ware reportedly offered safe house by BBC

The BBC has reportedly offered a safe house to Panorama reporter John Ware,
the journalist most closely associated with the expose on the Omagh bombing.

According to the Times newspaper, the Corporation has also offered Ware
personal protection.

The bomb blast outside the BBC's west London centre is being blamed on the
Real IRA, who may have acted in revenge over the Panorama reports.

Meanwhile, speculation that the BBC might move flagship current affairs
programme Panorama back to a weekday slot - but on BBC2 - refuses to go
away.

MediaGuardian quotes an 'insider' as saying: "Sunday may just have been a
transition. If it moved to a weekday slot, possibly even to BBC2, it would
increase its audience and get more share."

The BBC has insisted that Panorama will remain in its Sunday night slot,
despite opposition from some prominent figures, including Ware.

Indonesian copies of Time censored by distributor

The Indonesian distributor of Time Magazine censored pictures of headless
corpses -victims of the ethnic bloodshed in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan
province - in the Asian edition of the magazine, as he feared it would
incite more violence.

The front cover image and photographs inside the magazine, where decapitated
bodies were shown, were blacked out by hand in all copies being sent to
Indonesia. The distributor said it had not come under pressure from the
government to censor the pictures.

Time journalist Jason Tedjasukmana said he was concerned that the move could
lead to other companies taking censorship into their own hands.

UK broadcasters on guard against online poll rigging in Election run-up

The UK's top broadcasters have pledged to be on alert for attempts by
political activists to rig online polls in the run up the General Election.

The BBC's assistant director of news Mark Damazer told how the Corporation
had ran a poll during its Europe week coverage, only to inadvertently
receive an e-mail from a pressure group asking its supporters to '"keep
e-mailing this site, we need to get in as many votes as we can".

And ITN's editor-in-chief Richard Tait said: "We are going to be extremely
careful not to allow any online polling to be hijacked by an individual
group."

Guardian has created an online tribute.

In its birthday special "Seven Ages of Murdoch", the site tells Murdoch's
life story in seven animated cartoons. Its online birthday card has Murdoch
cutting a cake in the shape of the globe.

Tributes have been sent by The Telegraph's proprietor Conrad Black and
advertising chiefs Lord Saatchi and Sir Martin Sorrell. Says former Pearson
MD Frank Barlow: "Whether you love him or hate him, you can't help but
admire his achievements which are immense indeed." Visitors can send their
own tributes to the site's editor.

Dear Mr. Lay,

     Enron's  dynamic growth in the field of energy
during the last three years is truly remarkable. As a
student of business, I am truly impressed by the
strategic acquistions made by Enron in the area of
power and its leveraged arbitrage with the gas
industry.
     I would very much like to make a career within
Dynegy and would appreciate very much if you would
consider me for a Management trainee position in your
esteemed organization. Enclosed is a copy of my
resume.

Sincerely,

Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a "quid pro quo" from us.

We plan to distribute the final draft by mid-March in time for you to take
one last careful look before a conference call at the end of the month, and
also for you to submit any supplementary views for inclusion. My suggestion
is that views be kept to a few paragraphs, if possible. For those who wish
to write one, you could disagree with part of the report, you could suggest
a slightly different emphasis on some aspect of the report, or you could
underline some aspect that you are especially enthusiastic about and believe
deserves more attention.

When we send the next draft to you I'll try to propose something about how
we might release the report, but I would appreciate any suggestions you have
about that.

Here are two proposed dates for our next conference call. Please indicate
your availability by preference (#1, #2).

(#2) Wednesday, March 28, 5-6:30 PM
     (Eastern Standard Time)

(#1) Thursday, March 29, 5-6:30 PM

Could you also send us the precise way that you would like your name and

Many thanks,

Jim:
It was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday.  Based on our conversatio=
n,=20
this email includes the following:

An Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lan=
ds.

Our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h=
ow=20
to remove those impediments.

A description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability=
 to=20
sign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two=20
possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC=20
order clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through=20
rates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I=
=20
have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose=
d=20
amendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable=
=20
option.

Our assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.

Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near-=
=20
and long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your=20
office today detailed legislative language.  In those materials we will als=
o=20
identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed=
=20
language.

I hope that the information is useful.  Please do not hesitate to contact m=
e=20
if you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anythi=
ng=20
else that I can do to assist you.

Regards,
Ken Lay

2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation

Excessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges

Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=
 a=20
step in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20
designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20
monopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=
he=20
elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20
1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=
=20
California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=
e=20
the risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20
offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=
f=20
distributed generation.
=20
Excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20
investor-owned and municipal utilities

Solution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =
a=20
step in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20
interconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=
=20
requirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20
generation.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=
=20
interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=
=20
through executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20
possible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=
e=20
utility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20
accomplished through amendments to SB 27X.

Permitting and Air Quality Issues
Developers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=
 or=20
greater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=
d=20
therefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20
generation faces. =20

Solution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=
=20
D-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=
=20
output apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=
ities.=20
In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=
=20
face local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20
interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=
. =20
These objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.

3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=
=20
Electricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20

Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=
=20
suppliers.
Enron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=
e=20
goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.
However, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=
=20
concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.
We understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=
redit=20
risk concerns.
Enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=
=20
is working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=
=20
both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=
=20
going forward.

Summary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue

Ambiguous Ratemaking Authority
The language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20
charge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=
=20
analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20
California PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =
As=20
such, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=
es=20
adequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.

Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018
The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=
=20
Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=
=20
=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=
use to=20
allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20
purchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=
ee=20
to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=
=20
DWR has entered into with suppliers.
=20
Ambiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=
=20
Recover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases
In addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=
=20
noted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=
=20
the specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=
oy to=20
permit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=
s=20
extremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=
re=20
DWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =
is=20
difficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=
=20
rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=
=20
costs.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=
=20
suppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=
=20
from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.

Options to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20

We have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=
sk=20
issues.  We have identified three options:

Amend AB1X
The amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=
=20
PUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=
red by=20
DWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =
to=20
ensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=
=20
preferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=
=20
challenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20
entitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)

Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20
through Contract Language
This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20
implement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=
re=20
time to implement than the "legislative" fix.  We have attached electronic=
=20
copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=
=20
would need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20
=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)

Make Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk
As indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=
cept=20
other forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=
=20
cash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=
=20
indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=
=20
prefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=
=20
contract amendments.

4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001

Both the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20
Associates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=
=20
showing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=
r=20
only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=
l=20
credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=
=20
of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20
likely. =20

CEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20
summer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20
estimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=
 well=20
below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=
n=20
in the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=
=20
than other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20
unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=
o=20
date. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=
he=20
flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20
California=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =
this=20
requirement. =20

Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=
=20
draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve=
re=20
supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=
=20
number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20
utilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=
t=20
pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=
=20
added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.

CERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=
=20
rolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20
optimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=
=20
MWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=
=20
should view the CEC's "rosy scenario" with considerable skepticism.

5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=
=01,s=20
Electricity Crisis

This email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=
l=20
deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=
=20
bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.

As we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California's=20
crisis must focus on four issues:

Increase supply
Decrease demand
Establish a truly competitive retail electricity market
Return California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency

Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)
To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =
=20
Enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=
=20
than a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.

The Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=
slation=20
are steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=
se=20
efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=
=20
in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20
requirements included in the CEC's certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=
=20
proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20
transfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20
innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20
emissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=
ir=20
districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20
required reductions in pollution emissions.

Decrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)
Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=
=20
the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=
=20
best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=
st=20
effectively and quickly in two ways:

Buy-down demand
California is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=
d=20
to finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=
 more=20
economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=
ld=20
be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=
=20
through the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20
determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20
participate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20
necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20
reductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=
eal=20
Bench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.

Use Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment
To be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:

An internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=
=20
for hour-ahead power in real time.=20
Real-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=
=20
verification.

Subject: Invitation for IAEE Keynote


Hi Rosalee-- I just wanted to thank you so much for your extra help on our
inquiry to Ken.  We understand completely that the April 25 slot following
his return from vacation is not the most ideal arrangement.  I think it's
always easiest for someone like him if he knows that a speech given recently
can easily serve as the basis for a new request.  I wanted to remind you of
my previous suggestion that his keynote presentation in Montreal last May to
the World Forum on Energy Regulation would accomplish most of that, and we
would work with Rob and others to minimize any effort required to add new
content.  Hopefully, this will help with the decision this week.  As I
mentioned the other day, Ken is really the most authoritative figure when it
comes to the idea that economic concepts can be used to build energy markets
and business enterprises that lead to better societies!  Talk soon, and
don't hesitate to ever ask for a "quid pro quo" from us.

Subject: Referendum Campaign


Mr. Lay--

During the negotiations with the Rockets as to how much each party would
contribute to the Arena referendum campaign, Mike Goldberg of Baker & Botts
suggested that the Rockets would like to net their contribution obligation
against other contributions that they solicited.

After a conversation with you, John Watson and I advised Mike Goldberg that
you did not want to be competing with the Rockets in soliciting
contributions to the Arena referendum campaign.

Mike Goldberg called Friday and asked whether it would be acceptable for the
Rockets to net against their contribution obligation contributions that they
have solicited from Baker & Botts, Jim MacInvale and Tilman Fertitta.  Mike
suggested that these three persons would be the only outside persons that
would be solicited by the Rockets.

Would you please let me know if this is acceptable to you.  You or Rosalee
may call me at 713-758-2350 or send me a response e-mail at
mtelle@velaw.com.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle

Dear Kelly:

I appreciate your comments regarding Enron's advertising focus.  First, Enr=

Houston and to gain energy and facilities management business for Enron=20
Energy Services.  Acquiring the naming rights to the stadium came much late=
r=20
in our negotiations with the Astros.  In addition, while sports events like=
=20
NASCAR are exciting to watch and get a fair amount of media play,  we're=20
targeting a more specific audience with our advertising dollars.
 =20
Increasingly, Enron=01,s integrated products and services require the appro=
val=20
of an organization=01,s highest ranking officers, people who carry a =01&CX=
O=018=20
title, such as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief=20
information officer or chief technology officer. These individuals may not=
=20
recognize Enron=01,s name and abilities as readily as energy-centric execut=
ives.

We also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy an=
d=20
regulations affecting Enron businesses worldwide. The "Ask Why" advertising=
=20
campaign launched in February this year was designed with these groups in=
=20
mind as well as to put the Enron name and image on everyone=01,s radar scre=
en.=20
Enron commercials continue to appear on business channels such as CNBC and=
=20
CNNfn, as well as the History Channel, ESPN and network news programs. Some=
=20
are running in Europe as well.

While we won't rule out entirely the possibility of directing some of our=
=20
future advertising dollars toward sports events, for now, we believe we are=
=20
spending our ad budget where it will have the greatest positive impact on o=
ur=20

Thanks for your suggestion.  Keep them coming.

Mr. Lay,

I wasn't able to get my question to you at the all employee meeting. It was=

this:

The Enron sponsored Houston mini-cart Grand Prix entry placed second and=20
received free air time of "Enron" on the news. With NASCAR being as popular=

as it is today, itself a multi-billion dollar industry, why hasn't Enron=20
sponsored a racing team to compete against the other Fortune 500 sponsors?=

Enron is supporting stadiums, but why not a competition based on fuel,=20
energy, and the most powerful being the victor?

Now with cigarettes and alcohol banned from advertising, companies such as=

AOL, Compaq, Southern Company, and Infoseek are on the tracks. Each race=20
would provide more airtime of the Enron logo and further placement of "The=

nCUBE is in the video on-demand business.  Blockbuster and Enron have entered 
into an agreement with nCUBE that it will provide video streaming media 
appliances, software applications, technology consulting and design for the 
on-demand service.

Good morning, Michael.  Will there be enough funds to help Sue without 
Shell's if I wait until Mr. Lay returns on October 3?  I have not been very 
successful getting faxes through to the ship, so would prefer not to have to 
bother him with this unless absolutely necessary.

Subject: Referendum Campaign


Mr. Lay--

I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports
Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million
prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by
the partners to the referendum campaign.

Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect
to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this
week.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the
partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from
each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed
to the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this
procedure with Sue Walden.

With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and
Shell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum
campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action
committee (as required by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the
general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of
these laws provides that "a person may not knowingly make or authorize a
political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the
person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the
person actually making the contribution . . . ."   Pending a better
understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the
partnership's account.

Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have
any questions regarding the foregoing.

Sincerely,

Michael S. Telle


Good morning, Joe.  Ken is on a cruise, so is not available, but I did talk

Apparently, everything is still internal.  He said everything is fine, so 
hopefully, you don't need to be concerned.

Talk to you soon.

Subject: Selection Of My Successor-My Concern

Ken: I have "heard" from two sources in this office that Enron will announce 
my successor today. I have not been advised of the selection and am concerned 
that this announcement will not treat my retirement in an appropriate and 
deserving manner.

I have placed calls to Steve Kean since hearing this rumor but have not 
received a response as of now. Admittedl, our phone service because of the 
office construction is not totally functioning.

Frankly, I think this matter has not been handled in a caring way and I have 
been acccused of giving information on the selection to Tom DeLay which is 
untrue. My office mates are all more aware of the candidates and their status 
than I have been.

I regret having to contact you on this matter but feel that despite my total 
cooperation, allegiance and dedication to Enron, I am not being treated with 
the courtesy and sensitivity that this matter deserves.

Joe

Ken wanted me to let you know that he has something in Austin the night 
before and wanted to find out what time the event in Cornell begins.

Ken and Jeff,

As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the 
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become 
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which 
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They 
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will 
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their 
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to 
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would 
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a "Core School" in 
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for 
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.

Kevin

Kevin-


Just a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron's
participation in the Johnson School's March Leadership Week and the
possibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a
chance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on
you plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. 
Below is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all
is well with you.


            Nov.2 email text


We at Cornell's Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link
with Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the
agile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable
markets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like
Enron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic
Organizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and
beyond.


The specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. 
First, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key
speaker at the Johnson School's Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As
described in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three
conferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and
students.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a "live
case study" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,
2001</underline>.


You, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this
is the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay
and would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and
the Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the
corporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken
Chenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced
President of Kodak's new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a
distinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in
continually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  


We have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership
Week, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman
Sachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company
and an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank
Rhodes, but these are still long shots.


The point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the
Johnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted
a platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If
they can't do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the
date is March 28, 2001.       


The second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same
lines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it
could become the basis for the March conference live case study
presentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to
literally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage
an organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place
that you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to
be the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and
practices make this possible.


I know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around
1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and
leadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to
building this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer
from the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the
Enron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast
moving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient
way.


Kevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and
hopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to
make it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. 
Please let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As
always, thanks for your great personal support.


Dick



Ken will be out of the office.

Dear  Ken,

 I am sorry to say that earlier this week Arthur Levitt was called to
testify in Congress early on September 28, and he felt unable to make our
session as originally planned. It is my hope that we can reschedule with him
prior to -- or in conjunction with -- the final report. For those who may
have changed their schedules to make this meeting because of the chance to
talk to Arthur, I regret the inconvenience.

 In deference to your time, we'll go ahead with the meeting from 5 to
7 but not with the dinner.

 Here are the details of the meeting.  Note that the location is
different from the previous two meetings.

     Wednesday, September 27 from 5 to 7
p.m.

     New York, NY
     Check in on 23rd floor with Carol
Hubbard, who will direct you to the conference room
Phone: 212-446-8836

 Attached is the draft of our final report, prepared by Tim Koller.
It will be the subject of the meeting.  We will want to gather your comments
on the following:

     1.  Do you agree with the substance
of this draft?
     2.  Are there points that should
receive more or less emphasis?
     3.  Are there any other issues you
would like to raise?
     4.  Is there anything else about the
drafting and presentation that you would
like to comment on?

 We will need to get everyone's comments, one way or another, by the
end of September so we can proceed to prepare the final paper, which we'd
like to have ready by the end of October.

 Originally you said that you would not be able to make the meeting.
Could you let us know if your plans have changed and you can now come or
participate by phone?  See below for reply.

   ____ I will be there

   ____  I will participate by phone

               ____ I cannot make it at all but will

Subject: New PUHCA Exemption Legislative Language

Yesterday, Ken Lay spoke with MidAmerican CEO David Sokol regarding the 
attached new legislative amendment to provide a limited PUHCA exemption for 
companies with a high level of financial stability as determined by 
independent market analysts (i.e. "A" rating for Holding Companies or 
investment grade rating for utility companies).  This is not a permanent 
exemption as PUHCA would again apply should the company loose its high rating.

MidAmerican's lobbyist reported this conversation to me along with Ken Lay's 
reported commitment that we would review it as soon as we could.  Reportedly, 
Ken Lay was non-committal but not negatively disposed.

The utility strategy is to have Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE) offer this as an 
amendment to a "must pass" piece of legislation during the waning days of 
this Congressional session.  This will be separate from the utilities' 
strategy to enact Private Use legislation (H.R. 4971, S. 2967 which includes 
tax language to exclude water and sewage connection fees from gross income as 
contributions to capital and language to increase the amount permitted to 
paid into nuclear decommissioning reserve funds primarily  for Commonwealth 
Edison) and to enact stand-alone Reliability legislation (S. 2071 and H.R. 
2944).

Senator Kerrey has already spoken to Senator Gramm (R-TX) about this PUHCA 
amendment and Gramm was reportedly  non-committal but not negatively disposed 
to the idea.  I will follow-up with Gramm's staff next week after they've 
reviewed it and convey their views to you.  According to MidAmerican,  the 
concept to insure stockholder protection along with consumer protection was 
Senator Kerrey's idea.  

It is possible that Congressman Dingell (D-MI) and Congressman Markey (D-MA) 
would still actively oppose this limited exemption, especially given the fact 
that Congressman Dingell (who would Chair the Commerce Committee should the 
Democrats regain control of the House) has recently said that whether or not 
he is Commerce Committee Chairman next Congress, that comprehensive 
electricity restructuring legislation including PUHCA repeal is "at least 
three years away from happening."

Steve and Rick, can we get a temperature gauge next week as to our position 
on this amendment?  As a reminder, Enron's position here-to-date has been to 
oppose stand-alone PUHCA repeal as this is the one provision utilities like 
Southern Company really want.  To date, this strategy has worked with the 
MidAmerican Utility Group willing to support our transmission open access 
provisions in turn for our PUHCA exemption support.

To the attention of:
Dr Kenneth L. Lay
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
ENRON CORPORATION

Mexico Meeting 2000
Managing New Expectations and Old Challenges
Mexico City, Mexico 4-5 December

Dear Dr Lay,

Mexico awoke to a new political landscape on 2 July 2000. The economic and 
business climate is positive and full of new opportunities as Mexico finally 
completes a long transition from one-party dominance to pluralist democracy, 
adding political maturity to a more competitive market economy.

In light of the above, the World Economic Forum will hold a Mexico Meeting 
2000 on 4-5 December in Mexico City. Held in collaboration with the Mexican 
Investment Board, this gathering will take place three days after the 
inauguration of the new Mexican administration. We have already received 
confirmation that President-elect Vicente Fox and Mexican Central Bank 
Governor Guillermo Ortiz will participate. We are also expecting the presence 
of the future key cabinet members and state governors.

As usual, the World Economic Forum pulls together the right group of leaders 
to discuss issues, build a network of contacts and identify where future 
business opportunities and risks lie. The Meeting will focus on four main 
topics: the country's political and social agenda, Mexico's commercial

Hello Mr. Lay,

It's been a long time since we've talked.  I'm Priscilla Slade, President of
Texas Southern University.  The primary purpose of this e-mail is to invite
you to attend a weekend at the home of President and Mrs. Bush September
16-18.  So many people have expressed a desire to become know more about the
University (it's new initiatives and successes) that  President Bush
volunteered to host a gathering of 25 CEOs and spouses (or a second person
in the corporate hierarchy).  In addition to having fun golfing, sailing,
boating, etc., we are presenting ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TEXAS SOUTHERN
UNIVERSITY.

I know this is your favorite topic and that we can look forward to you
joining us.  An invitation is in the mail.  I look forward to you joining
us.

Sincerely,

Priscilla


Ms. Peppers, I am very sorry, but I must once again reschedule the 
appointment that you have with Mr. Lay.  He will be out of town the entire 
week of September 26.  

The first available time to reschedule is October 19, 2000.  Would an 
afternoon appointment work for you - about 2:00 p.m.?

I look forward to hearing from you.

RosaleeDear Dean Walker -

Ken Lay asked me to respond to you re:  1). naming the new professorship the 
Pinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship - this is fine.
2)  He will be pleased to serve as the keynote speaker for the banquet on 
October 13.

Thanks.

Rosalee

Subject: P. Walker professorship and keynote request


Thanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the
professorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I'm delighted that you plan to
attend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.

The purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient
way of reaching you, is two-fold:

     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney
C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the
professorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some
other area, I'd like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in
the College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.
Both Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into
Harold Hook to seek his input.

A few points of elaboration:
     * "Distinguished" is a standard adjective in the titles of such
positions.
     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the
college to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my
approval.
     * And, I don't know if we will have the recipient selected by October
13.

This name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney's great strength,
(2) allows me to avoid any "turf battles" (either within the college or with
Economics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the
college.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.

     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society
banquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief
talk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of
business.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive
event.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now
live in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have
chosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.
Your talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed
(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.
I understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the
morning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable
for the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in
choosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you
will serve as the keynote speaker.

If you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the
plans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney
Walker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if
you have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is
573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.

Let me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not
Pinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been
experiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I've heard is that
he intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.
Time permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you'll
see him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his
wife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I
will host that evening for members of the college's advisory board.  Of
course, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it's
my understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)

Ken, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of "R&R"
during your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Ken Lay asked me to advise you that he can't do this one, but would consider 
other dates.

Ken, I understand that you are trying to clear your sch. to speak at the
River Oaks Breakfast Club on Oct. 26.  I hope it works out because I always
hear what is going on at Enron.  Peter

Mr. Hines -

To get back with you re: your question about some kind of Futures/Options 
market in the commercial space market, Ken Lay said that to approach Jeff 
Skilling about it is absolutely the right approach.

Subject: Arena


I wanted to make sure you were aware of something that has come up since
the last breakfast meeting regarding our group financing the Arena parking
garage.  Baker & Botts put us in touch with the Rockets to discuss Hines
being the Development Manager on the Arena and garage.  Although not fully
agreed, there is strong interest on both sides.  Besides help on the
development front, we think there may be value in our acting as a bit of a
buffer between the Sports Authority and the Rockets and coordinating any
issues involving the new convention hotel(where we are also providing
development management).  The Rockets(Mike Goldberg-Baker & Botts) have
talked to Ric Campo and supposedly he is enthusiastic but thinks this
should "be the Authority's idea.".  One issue is how much of our fee would
apply to the garage, which presumably the city would pick up, and how much
would apply to the Arena.  Since this is a fast moving issue, I wanted you
to know about this. Obviously the discussions are all very confidential.
If you have any thoughts in advance of the next breakfast meeting, please
give me a call at 713-966-2606.

Also, on another topic, we have been doing a tiny bit of pie in the sky
brainstorming on the concept of creating some kind of Futures/Options
market in the commercial space market.  I will approach Jeff Skilling
unless you would recommend elsewhere within Enron.


Hi Mr. Moore -

With regard to working out a convenient date to meet with  you, Rosalee has 
suggested that your week of September 4 is pretty well  booked-up. Would 
either September 11 or 13 work? After that I have to join Norm  Blake at the 
Olympics in Sydney. While all of this can de done by phone, as  deputy to the 
chairmen, I'm making every effort to meet (albeit briefly) with  each 
Committee member. If you are willing to host a meeting in Houston, I want  to 
make every effort to have Paul Newman in  attendance.

Dar, are you on-line?  If so, please answer back.  I have questions.  Well, 
I'll ask them.  Did you get the wedding pics?

meI seem to have three appointments next week:

Tuesday, August 29:  Doctor appointment at 9:40 a.m. (enlightenment)

Wednesday, August 30:  Hair appointment @ 2:00 p.m (beauty)

Thursday, August 31:  Dental appointment @ 2:00 p.m. (ouch)


I plan to return to the office each day, but the dental appointment may take 
awhile.

Subject: Governors Conference




Dear Ken, 

It was good to talk with you last week, and I hope you got some vacation in 
Aspen.? I'm working at it! 

Rosalie said you'd be getting in this afternoon, and I? wanted to reach you 
by phone or e-mail before Governor Tony Knowles from Alaska calls you.? 
Governor Knowles (classmate of George W.), along with Governor Taft of Ohio, 
has enlisted us in a conference that seven governors are sponsoring on 
natural gas in order to elucidate the market and issues -- and needs -- 
before it explodes as a political issue -- and perhaps helps head it off (in 
contrast to what happened with gasoline).? Governor Knowles is the current 
chairman of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission, and it will be under the 
auspices of the IOCC.? They promise at least seven governors and a lot of 
other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very timely event.

They would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be kicking 
off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high visibility 
platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and honored -- to have 
you in that featured role in it works for your schedule.

It takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. 

Tony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms very 
large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill you in 
further on what they would like to accomplish.

If it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, 
that would be great. 

On behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. 

Best, 

Dan 


Amy, you are a treasure!!!  I know you'll be a treasure of a Mom, too!!  But 
I'll miss you!!

Subject: Invitation to deliver 2001 IAEE conference keynote


Dear Ken:

Next April 25-27, 2001, Houston will host the 24th conference of the
International Association for Energy Economics, in combination with the
annual meeting of our U.S. Association for Energy Economics affiliate.  We
invite you to serve as our opening keynote speaker at the kick off luncheon
on Wednesday, April 25 to help set the tone, goals and objectives for this
event.

Our theme is "2001: An Energy Odyssey." We are using the conference to
showcase the role of economics in developing markets for energy, and to
deal with issues that impede, or facilitate, market development as well as
enterprise strategy and metamorphosis.  We can think of no one better to
clearly define these major themes and priorities than you.

I was a speaker and delegate at the World Forum on Energy Regulation in
Montreal last May, and greatly enjoyed your luncheon keynote (and hope that
the regulators and policy makers attending the Forum took your key points t=
o
heart).  The thoughts you offered -- on the importance of standards, the
opportunities to build network platforms and Enron's own experience, are of
vital importance to IAEE/USAEE members.  We would ask you to include
comments on the fundamental importance of economic principles in both
guiding market development and the efforts of those of us who operate in
markets on behalf of enterprises.

The IAEE remains the largest worldwide combination of industry, business an=
d
university interests engaged in energy development and policy.  To bring yo=
u
up-to-date on the association, our Web site is www.iaee.org. I'm sure
Rosilea will have someone on her staff pull the relevant materials together
for you. I have also included the call for papers for the Houston conferenc=
e
(at the end of this mail) which lines out the major sessions and topics. In
addition to our invitation to you, we are inviting Mark Moody-Stuart of
RD/Shell for the April 26 keynote luncheon to address environmental issues
and Rilwanu Lukman, Secretary General of OPEC (and a member of IAEE), in a
joint session with the Board of Directors of the Offshore Technology
Conference on Friday, to cover worldwide outlooks for oil and gas.

Finally, as you know, Enron Corp. for some time has been a corporate
sponsor of our UH Energy Institute and the previous Natural Gas Project,
which you helped to found.  Thus, we also are relying on Rob Bradley to hel=
p
identify and implement the major environmental themes for the plenary
session, "Sustaining Development" (yes, we indeed are trying to turn
thinking around with our re-phrasing).

I hope to hear from Rosilea soon on your interest and availability.  We
look forward to having you with us next April!

Hi Mr. Lewis -

your name for consideration to Dick Cheney.  He asked if you would please

Subject: New Administration


Ken,

Sorry to miss you today when I called. Since I am leaving for India in a
few minutes, I thought I would sent you an E-mail, and then I can try to
call you from India. Because of the time difference, it will not be easy
for us to connect. Unfortunately I will not be back in the US until
December 7.

The reason for my call was to see if you would feel comfortable putting my
name forward to Dick Cheney for a position in the new administration. I am
not sure where the best fit would be, but it might be Chairman of the
National Economic Council. That job has a good combination of management
and economics. You know I have only been associated with Democratic
administrations in past, but Democratic administrations were a little
different in those days. You are somewhat familiar with my record on
economics and there is a lot on that in the public domain.

Just let me know what you think. Maybe a quick E-mail would suffice ( I am
carrying my computer).

Best regards,
Bill

Hi Kenny: Bonny sent me your E-mail address and
so I am trying it out. Sorry we could not make it
to the party. The temperature is very warm here
in Kansas today. I checked Enron stock recently
and it looks like it is doing fine. I am
particularly interested in your venture into the
fiber optics communications business and the
windpower. We sold our interest in the Cellular
business last year and I think the land line
company will be sold soon. We sold to Allied
Telephone Coimpany of Little Rock. Two other
engineers and myself put Kansas Cellular together
about 14 years ago. Then we built a fiber system
from East to West across Kansas. That was sold
with the Cellular. Take care of yourself-Loyal

Subject: Dinner with V. Fox

Dear Ken,
 Federico Sada, who is travelling with President elect Vicente Fox in South 
America, called me this morning, 
and asked me to give you the confirmed list of attendees to the dinner in New 
York, Wednesday August 23, 8:00 P.M.
at the Watteau Room of the St. Regis Hotel:

 Sanford I. Weill   Citigroup, Inc.   Chairman and CEO
 Hendrick Verfaille  Monsanto Co.   President and CEO
 William B Harrison, Jr.  Chase Manhattan Corp.  Chairman and CEO
 Raymond V. Gilmartin  Merck and Company, Inc. Chairman and CEO
 Michael Armstrong  AT&T    Chairman and CEO
 Stephen M. Wolf  US Airways   Chairman and CEO
 Kenneth L. Lay   Enron Corp.   Chairman and CEO

Pending confirmation
 Douglas A. Warner III  J.P. Morgan   Chairman

According to Federico, if there is any late cancellation, no one will be 
substituted. Also, there is a small possibility that
the dinner could take place in Washington, rather than N.Y., based on Fox's 
meeting with President Clinton; they are still
working on the final agenda. 
 
 Max and myself are working on the background information that you will need, 
and will keep you posted of any 
changes; best regards,  jaime____
Mr. Christman:

Thank you for your invitation for Dr. Lay to speak at your upcoming forum in

If you are inclined to accept this invitation, we could put together an

some national statistics and then segue into Enron's emphasis on wellness and 
having fun in the workplace.  Our strategy and experience will be very 
interesting to the group since it shows what a corporate leader is doing to 
become the employer of choice in the marketplace.

You could expect a full house (around 400) for the talk.  If it fits into

Letter dictated by Ken Lay

Gene:

 I appreciated the update on your health status.  It appears you are taking a 
very tough situation and, with help from some of the best doctors in the 
world, setting about to turn it around.  I'm sure it goes without saying that 
you know we are all pulling for you and betting on a positive outcome.

 Clearly your health is the number one issue now.  To the extent you want to 
work and can work, we are delighted to have you back in the office.  But that 
is a very distant secondary concern until you get everything done about your 
health that can be done.  If there is any way I or Enron can be of any 
further help, please let me know.

Ken Dictated letter from Ken Lay

Dear John:

I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments 
concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a 
great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.

I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks 
quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a 
summer conference.

The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste 
Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to 
Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully 
considered.

I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current 
time.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too 
distant future.

Warm regards,

Ken-I have revised the term sheet provided to us by George yesterday along
the lines that you suggested to give the partners somewhat stronger rights
on the choice of seats and suites.  These rights are not as strong as the
rights the Partnership got from the Astros, but I hope they will be
considered sufficient by the partners.  I received an e-mail yesterday from
Conoco reiterating Archie's concern on the preferential rights.  So far, all
of the partners  I've heard from on the financing term sheet are OK with it.
However, I haven't yet heard from Ric Campo on the financing term sheet.

Dear Mr. Lay:
             My name is James Partsch-Galvan. I am the Libertarian Candidate

winning side last year, and I am galvanizing to be be on the winning side
this year.
I find it very deporable that the Sports Authority cancelled its Board
Meeting tomorrow. This is another dirty trick that the Sports Authority is
making to make it harder for citizens to voice their opinions. This is one
more reason for taxpayers to vote no for any taxpayer funds to fund a new
arena that is not needed.

Hi Deborah -

Ken Lay does want to meet with you re:  your earlier e-mail.  I know this 
sounds incredible, but the really best date is not until September 26!!!  His 
schedule is just not to be believed!!!  He is pretty free that day, so he 
could do an early afternoon.  Would 2:00 p.m. work for you?

Thanks.

Subject: 2nd Annual Enron/MDA Beach Bowl


Hello, Mr. Lay! Enron and MDA are joining together again to do a 2nd Annual 
Beach Bowl to raise money for MDA. Last year, the event was a great success, 
raising over $70,000.  This year's goal is to raise $100,000, so the 
fundraising benchmarks for all teams have been raised. The money raised will 
be used to further research for ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).

I have put together a team of Analyst interns (Howard Goldfarb, Rachel 
McPhaul, Nicole Brady, Bradley Aiken and myself) for a second year to help in 
this cause.  The benchmark for the team is the raise $600 (pre-matching), but 
I want to outdo the fundraising of $1400+ (post-matching) we did last year.

I am asking for a donation to MDA to help our team bowl in this event.  
Checks are payable to MDA.

FYI, Enron matches all donations $20 or more. 

The event will take place on Saturday, July 29, 2000.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks! Have a great day!

To: Jeff Skilling/Corp/Enron@ENRON
cc: Joseph W Sutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Kenneth 
Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON 
Subject: OK, Jeff, you requested that we be candid about Enron...

"Management does things right; Leadership does the right things." (Peter 
Drucker)

Today I began to wonder if I've been a fool in staunchly defending Enron's 
Visions & Values. 

An esteemed colleague of very strong professional reputation at Enron was 
recently approached by a hiring supervisor.  Totally unexpected & 
unsolicited, an offer was accepted; all seemed well as this Recruit got good 
feedback directly from clients & Enron upper mgmt.  But after a short time, 
suddenly Recruit was told that performance was unsatisfactory.  No specific 
behaviors or problems were identified as cause; no opportunity given to 
modify; Recruit was summarily removed to another floor with instructions to 
find another job.  Upon displacement she told me (~6 weeks ago), "I want 
avoid trouble for anyone; I just want to continue quietly at Enron and forget 
this."  

To date I have honored her request for silence, but all this hullabaloo about 
Enron being the best place to work makes her dilemma particularly upsetting, 
and there is ample evidence that her plight is not unique.  I refer here to 
Cindy Adams, formerly of Joe Sutton's office.  I don't care why it was 
decided not to use HR's counseling/review process designed to help when 
things go awry; I just know that Enron's best bet is to give this talented 
professional more time.  She writes:

...Last week, my HR Rep informed me that I have a deadline of July 15th in 
which to find a job...I have no assistance from HR or Recruiting.  I had 2 
interviews 5 weeks ago and I had to initiate those myself.  I've not received 
answers from postings I've responded to - I am left hanging without 
acknowledgment of any sort.

I have been approached and learned from others that the same thing happened 
to them with the same circumstances; one said that it took her a full 3 
months to land her present job.  I am not afforded that opportunity now ...

Jeff, would you please ask someone to remove Cindy's July 15 deadline?  There 
are no rules left to break here; Cindy is trying to proceed diligently & 
discreetly, but she is under duress by not having any feedback/support from 
HR.   With a little boost, it's not too late to bring this picture into line 
with Enron's vision of retaining topnotch people.  

Cindy has no idea that I'm writing on her behalf, and after this I intend to 
honor her wishes with silence.  But you must see the irony here, not to 
mention the double standard in how Enron's Visions & Values are applied to 
assistants all over Enron:  Cindy Adams was sought after, then abruptly put 
out of the office of Joe Sutton, who happens to be our V&V expert!  I'm not 
blaming Joe for anything; he is simply the backdrop in this example.  I 
remember Joe once used an expression at a floor meeting:  "believing your own 
baloney."  He wasn't talking about Visions & Values then, but "believing 
baloney" suddenly seems to fit for assistants who work at Enron.  You asked 
for candid; herein I have done my very best to give it to you.

Jeff, thanks for asking and listening.  I and my colleagues are listening 
too, but seeing is believing.

Respectfully submitted,

Betty Alexander
Sr. Administrative Assistant

Mr. Lay is planning on attending in person.

Dear Kenneth,

 Hello! I wanted to inform you of an exclusive Delphi Event.  Attached is a 
letter from Tom Koulopoulos, The Delphi Group's CEO, explaining the details 
for our upcoming Executive Retreat to be held on August 28-29 in Aspen. This 
is going to be a truly unique experience.

 I would like to extend you and other senior level executives at Enron an 
invitation to this  event. I have already invited George Short. This event is 
limited attendance since the St. Regis Aspen can only accommodate 200. The 
early registration fee is $2500.00 per seat.

 I will follow up with you later in the week. In the meantime, if you have 
any questions, please e-mail or call me at 617-247-1511.

Best Regards,

Shawn Christy

electronic energy marketplace". This session has no  bullet points as I wou=
ld=20
like the speaker to address only the latest issues as  they see fit. My=20
research has showed that the industry is very interested in  your opinions =
on=20
this subject and I hope you can fit this hour-long session into  you busy=
=20
schedule.

=01+Information Technology=01, will take a focused look  at the latest adva=
nces=20
being made in the energy market=01,s systems and  technologies. The confere=
nce=20
will be structured in two streams, offering  delegates and speakers the=20
chance to tailor the event to their own areas of  interest. The streams wil=
l=20
be partitioned into five areas:=20

1) Information technology for risk management

2) Information technology for pricing and trading

3) Data techniques and strategies

4) Advanced technologies for trading and risk management

5) Challenges of the evolving energy marketplace

Each of these categories will investigate the kind of problems  being faced=
=20
by energy IT/IS managers, traders and risk managers alike. I have  attached=
 a=20
copy of the program for your information. There will also be a  software=20
exhibition at the conference at which vendors will be demonstrating  their=
=20
products, as well as a post-conference seminar on data management.

This conference will be of the highly technical level that  people have com=
e=20
to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage  participation=
=20
from speakers in modifying the program to suit the audience and  issues at=
=20
hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please  let=
=20
me know; any help would be gratefully received.

This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy  & Power Risk=20
Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to  attract th=
e=20
leading market players by providing a first-class program with  top-rated=
=20
speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy  industry.

Unfortunately my schedule for this program is very tight. I  would greatly=
=20
appreciate an email soon to let me know if you would like to take  part in=
=20
this event. If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to  ge=
t=20
in touch.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Joel Hanley

Subject: Materials for Aspen ISIB's Business Leaders Dialogue


Dear Rosalie/Dorothy:

Tomorrow, we are sending to all participants via Airbourne, reading
materials for the Business Leaders Dialogue in Aspen, Colorado (July 27-30).
We have noticed that our mailing address for Mr. Lay is a p.o. box.
Unfortunately, our express courier will not ship to a p.o. box.  Is there a
street address that you can provide for Mr. Lay so that we can express mail
him his Dialogue materials?

Your assistance in this would be greatly appreciated.


Kind Regards,

Godwin Carmona
Program Coordinator
Aspen ISIB
