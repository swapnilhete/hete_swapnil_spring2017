Hi all!

We went looking at puppies this weekend, supposedly
just "to look," and of course end up bringing one
home!  She has already made the trip to the office and
one of my co-workers had his digital camera here to
take pictures for Halloween!

Hope to talk to each of you soon!

Love, Julia

Subject: Tonight's Gathering - National Championship

Hello Everyone,

I hope that you all enjoyed the holidays, and I'd venture to say that most of 
you enjoyed it more than I did.  I did however have a great New Years.  It 
actually inspired this email.  On the 6 hour trip back to Houston from New 
Orleans yesterday Tim and I came to the conclusion that the analysts haven't 
gotten together in awhile and decided to arrange a gathering.  We were 
thinking about doing Texadelphia tonight for the Sugar Bowl.  It's located at 
6025 Westheimer (ph # 713-785-6700).  Also, I think we are going to do 
Woody's on Richmond Thursday night if anyone's interested.  Please let me 
know if you plan on attending.  I think we are going to head over there 
between 6:30 - 7:00.

Hope to see you all tonight!!

LISA
I think you are just trying to avoid me!  It's been two weeks, huh?  

I'll be up late tonight watching the national championship, so give me a call 
when you get in.

Please remind your guys to report Gas Daily positions for Dec. and Jan

This a result of computer logic problem and not an ERMS/TAGG problem.  Also,

Hey Melissa,

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner but I have been using up my last 
bit of vacation.  I have been keeping track of the accrual value estimate but 
I want to get some confirmation from the transport and marketing groups on 
how we want to account for it.  I'll let you know soon.

Eric, 

With the new Wellhead Portfolio, will Greg's Accrual income be readily 
identifiable?

He is looking to have adjustments made to credit him accrual income for both 
the 3rd and 4th Quarters.  Will you be able to back into these numbers using 
this portfolio? 

If you have an estimate number of what the accrual value would be, just let 
me know, and I can pass that along to Greg. 

Thanks,
Melissa

Subject: A$M and its "second tier" status



Hate to promote the obvious.  US News & World Reports has their most current 
college rankings out, and, yes, Texas is in the top 50 schools in the 
country.  A$M in the meantime has returned to their fabled "second tier" 
status where all "second tier" schools belong.  I don't really care if Texas 
Monthly prints a huge front page article that says "UT....THE BEST SCHOOL IN 
TEXAS".....Of course Texas Monthly would never do that because IT ISN"T 
NEWS!!!!!!!   Tell us something we don't know!  You will recall that a couple 
of years ago, Texas Monthly reported that a$m was "the best school in Texas", 
relying on US NEWS & WORLD REPORTS rankings.  I guess that was short lived.

Whoops.  Looks like a$m is STILL ranked considerably lower than Texas in both 
Business and Engineering, in spite of the fact that every agroid will tell 
you differently.

I apologize for the short notice.  I am cancelling today's meeting due to the 
need to analyze the OA's and the matrix.  Please let me know if you guys will 
be available next Wednesday for a meeting(lunch will be provided).  I should 
have the info sooner than that, I would just like to keep on our normal day.  
Due to the holidays, some people may be out.  Let me know if you are able to 
attend that day so that I can order enough lunch.  Thanks.  Sorry again for

   I think we'll have a lot of fun this weekend.  Sierra sounds good to me.  I
   really like that place--I was just there the other night for a recruiting
   dinner and it's all decorated for Christmas.

   Jill, Matt's date, who works at Deloitte also lives all the way out in the
   Woodlands and she is probably going to come to my house and get ready.  I
   guess we'll figure out the rest of the specifics later.

   Tomorrow is going to be a pretty rough day here at my client; so give me a
   call tomorrow night, if that's ok.  Or you can email me--for some reason I
   didn't get your email until 5:30 today and it looks like you sent it during
   lunch.

Hey Shirley,

I just wanted to drop you a line and tell you that I am looking forward to
Saturday night.  I don't know the specifics yet, but Chad and Matt had planned
on going to Sierra for drinks at around 7:30.  I'll give you a call tomorrow 
to
let you know all of the details.

See you soon.

Eric, I have reviewed the users that have access similar to yours and want to 
confirm if they are in the Risk Management group for Texas/HPLC.  Please let 
me know which users are not in your group and also add people in your group 
that I have not listed.

In addition, I noticed that some users have a Risk Management role while 
others have a Trader role.  The ONLY difference between those two roles is 
that the trader roles allows you to have access to Trade Blotter.  If no one 
is entering trades directly into Trade Blotter, let me know so that I can 
change everyone's roles to the Risk Management role.  It makes it a lot 
easier when I am trying to categorize users.  You still have access to Deal 
Ticker, Deal Manager (read/edit) and Position Manager under the Risk 
Management role.  Thank you for your time in advance and for your quick 
responses.  I understand that you are busy so please take your time in 
getting back with the requested information.

Subject: Risk Book Post ID's for EOL Reporting

There has apparently been some misunderstanding regarding the scope of 
calculations that must be covered under the Post ID's submitted for EOL 
reporting each night. Many desks are turning in post IDs which only cover 
books in which EOL activity has taken place, thus ommitting many other 
non-eol trades. What is needed is post IDs which will collectively cover the 
entire universe of gas trading which has taken place on a given desk. In 
running the collective post ID's we need to be able to capture all trading 
which has taken place on a given day and the scope of the post ID's must 
cover this. 
You can send future lists to me.

Thanks,

Eric

Please list only the ones you deal with and need access to.

Brett,

Just thought I'd drop you a line.  Cool site, I guess you have too much spare 
time on your hands.  
Nothing too exciting is going on here in h-town - just working.  I am trading 
gas futures and other derivatives for Enron- it can get exciting at times 
(lots of $ flying trading hands), but I haven't got to blow anything up like 
you, so I feel that my life is somewhat lacking.  
Big news on Marilyn - I had thought that you broke up before your foray to

Hey y'all,

Got bored, made a homepage, lemme know what you think.

address is:  http://lawlerspage.homestead.com/

I'm not sure but I think if I edit or add stuff to the page you have to
re-enter the address if u had it bookmarked so I reckon if u bookmark it and
it don't work it's cause I added some stuff.  Either that or it was just a
freak one time thing (I tried to use my bookmark today and it no workie).

Lawler, OUT.

Hey Gillette,

The heat rate is going to depend on the type of fuel and the construction 
date of the unit.  Unfortunately, most of that info is proprietary.  

Chris Gaskill is the head of our fundamentals group and he might be able to 
supply you with some of the guidelines.

Hey Bass,

I have a question and I am hoping you can help me.  I am wanting to compile a 
list of all the different types of power plants and their respective heat 
rates to determine some sort of generation ratio.

i.e. Coal  4 mmbtu = 1 MW
 Simple Cycle 11 mmbtu = 1 MW

Please let me know if you can help me or point me to someone who can.  Just 
FYI...Bryan suggested that I call you so blame him as you curse me under your 
breath right now.

Thanks,
Lisa

Gentlemen,

The following are links that have a map and a bracket for the tournament. 
Our first game is at 8:30 AM on Sunday. We have already lost Darren for the 
whole tournament and Gosset for at least the first game. 
Everyone must be there on TIME. That means that you must be at the fields no 
later than 8 AM! We now only have 10 guys for the first game!!!!!!!

If you can't make it at 8 AM, tell me know so we can replace you!!!!! 
EVERYONE e-mail me and let me know that you will be there by 8 AM! Gosset 
will fire you if you screw the team!!!!

What's up guys?  Sorry for this mass e-mail, but you have got to see this
... be careful if you are viewing this at work or anywhere public.  I know
there are a few of you I haven't been in touch with for a while, but please
forgive me as I've been tied up in a shithole in Paducah, KY.  I hope all is
well with you.  Enjoy this e-mail.  BTW - Jared, this is a REAL forward ...
send me more of this stuff instead of the other crap that comes my way!
Adios,
Patrick

If only I knew who these girls were!

Eric,

Counterparty would like to see volume as 910,000/mo rather than 29355/day, 
due to the 5 MMBtu discrepancy our volume causes.  Can you adjust TAGG to the 
per month volume?

Thanks,
Joe

I'm not sure what time the game is tomorrow, I think 7, but unfortunately 
ya'll will have to do w/o me.  I know it will be tough making up for my 4 pts 
and 2 reb per game, but I think you will survive.  We play Hiemstra's team, 
and he said they are terrible, so good luck.  Let me know if you will be able 
to play, and if we're short I'll try and find a sub.

I can't make it during lunch.  Sorry.

Subject: Astros Tickets  

OK Gang,
Time to select (and pay) for 2001 tickets.
What I have is:
Gary Lamphier  25 games
Greg Brazaitis  20 games
Jason Mathew  10 games $340
Stacey Neuweiler 10 games $340
Eric Bass     5 games $170
Elsa V      5  games $170
Danny Conner     5  games $170

Jim Homco has two seats next to us and is hoping to trade so any of us can 
have 4 seats to a game and he can then have 4 seats to a game.
We need to draft this week.  I will set the rotation by number of tickets 
purchased to start the rotation then random draw.  In other words I will pick 
1st, Greg 2nd,
Stacey & Jason 3rd & 4th ( I will flip a coin that day) and Eric , Elsa and 
Danny to follow ( we will draw an order that day).  
So in summary there are 16  packages of 5 games; so every 16 games I will get 
5, Greg 4, Jason  and Stacey 2, and the other 3 one.
So round 1 would look like this:

 1) Gary
 2) Greg
 3) Jason/Stacey
 4) Jason/Stacey
 Picks 5-16 will then be pulled out of a hat to determine order for all 
remaining picks with Gary's name 4 times, Greg 3 times, and every one else 
once.
We need to do this this week.  How about Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday from 
11:00 - 1:00 (we should finish earlier).  The schedule is at astros.mlb.com 
or I will bring hard copies for you.

Please respond today of any date that does not work.

Eric,

EES claims volume on QR8935.1 should be 240,000.  TAGG currently shows 
210,000.  Can you look into?

Thanks,

hey mom,

we drove by some houses in the potomac area - the problem is that all of the 
newer houses are in the $600K+ range.  the older houses are not much to look 
at from the outside but iw ould like to see some.
i have cash for dad but if you don't need it that is fine.  my bill thus far 
is $500 but i can pick it up this weekend.

i had no idea about the date change - when is it?

Love,
e

my limit increased at the grocery  store so it won't be a problem anymore.? I 
do owe you a check.? What  is your address so I can mail it to you?? Or, do 
you want to pick it up  this weekend?? How much do I owe you, $400 or $500?

Did you have a good time with D and Jason  Friday?? I hear they have changed 
the wedding date.? Did they say  anything to you?

Have a great day.?  LU-M

Box Score Banter
The following question and statistical numbers come via J.C. Corrigan of 
Richmond, Va.

He asks:

"Which conference is best? Pac -0? ACC? SEC? Big 10? Big 12? Big East? Using 
the RPI, I evaluated the top eight teams in each conference (ACC is the 
smallest in terms of members, and I threw out their "Russian judge" team). 
If you were to add these individual team RPI up, the least sum would 
indicate the greatest depth:

Big Ten, 178; SEC, 194; Big East, 246; Big 12, 278; ACC, 369; Pac-10, 382.

Now some may argue that you should not count the bottom teams, since half 
are forced into a losing record. Others say, only one team can win, so why 
concern yourself with the bottom feeders? To refute that, here's what the 
sums look like using only the top four teams from each conference:

SEC, 40; Pac-10, 41; ACC, 48; Big Ten, 49; Big East, 66; Big 12, 69.

If indeed each conference has their bottom feeders, then we want to make 
sure there are no "gimmies" for those teams on top. So what's the RPI rating 
of the lowest team in each conference?

SEC, 103 (LSU); Big Ten, 135 (Northwestern); Big 12, 157 (Texas Tech); Big 
East, 167 (Virginia Tech); ACC, 168 (Clemson) Pac-10, 173 (Washington State)

Others will argue that we should include each team and then "normalize" 
based on the number of teams per conference. This will also account for the 
small differences between teams and reward second-tier team strength. Here 
are the conferences with their average RPI and median RPI.

SEC (39.1, 38.5), Big Ten (39.4, 29.0), Big East (45.2, 49.0), ACC (59.7, 
35.0), Big 12 (66.7, 47.0), Pac-10 (70.8, 55.0).

This data clearly shows how "top heavy" the ACC, Big 12 and Pac-10 are. But 
who's the best? When evaluating where each conference ranks across the these 
five categories:

SEC: 2-1-1-1-3 8

Big Ten: 1-4-2-2-1 10

Big East: 1-5-4-3-4 17

ACC: 5-3-5-4-2 19

Big 12: 4-6-3-5-4 22

Pac-10: 6-2-6-6-6 26

The SEC has a slight edge over the Big Ten, but some may say the RPI is 
biased. So how would these numbers hold up using the Sugaring Ratings?

SEC: 10

Big 10: 11

ACC: 12

Big 12: 20

Pac-10: 22

Big East: 29

Personally, I think the RPI is a little more accurate. Hope you found this 
interesting in my attempt to answer the oldest question in the NCAA book. 
Ideally, I would like to include head-to-head competition and run these 
numbers, but I'm an amateur and I don't that much time on my hands."

Hey Mom,

The trip was fun but I lost $650.  It wasn't good for the wallet.  Vegas is a 
fun weekend trip but I can't imagine staying longer than that.

How was your weekend?

x3-0977Hey Dad.  I am looking forward to Vegas.  Hopefully I won't lose too much $.

Hi Guy. Do hope you have a great trip to Vegas. It  should be fun. Do not let 
those tables become too attractive to you. The more  time you spend @ the 
tables the greater the odds are that the house will take  your money. I talk 
from experience. Nice touch on the flowers to your Mom. She  really is 
enjoying them. It made her feel good that you remembered her on  Valentine's 
Day. Call us when you get home. Love-Dad

not yet - when does she play?

Big talk for a guy whose school is on NCAA probation as we speak.  

http://www.ncaa.org/databases/db1/probation.html

By the way, I see from the latest RPIs that LSU is really pulling their 
weight as the lowest-ranked team in the SEC, right behind Austin Peay.  But 
hey, at least you're still ahead of Iona and Bradley.

Excerpt from an article on espn.com

Given Kentucky's decades-long legacy of cheating in both basketball and 
football,
                  ousting Mumme was a mandatory move. The school's image is 
too fragile to
                  countenance keeping a coach with major violations on his 
watch.

Enough said.

Hey Mom,
I would like to see the Mandell and the Huldy - preferably tomorrow before 
4ish.  Let me know if that works for you.  Dad is welcome to see whichever 
houses he would like.

FYI, I am meeting with Bob Dunn today after work, and I made copies of the 
contracts.

Hi Eric,

Do you want me to check with the realtors to see if those houses are open
this weekend and, if not, do you want me to make appts.?  Let me know.  I'll
do that today.  I would like Dad to see Mandell but that's up to you.  He
can't do it today, I don't think.  But, if you would like to see something
today, I'll try to arrange it.  I would prefer to see all of them the same
day but I will leave the up to you.  I didn't want you to think that I have
forgotten about you.  Did you download the contract and make copies?  LU-M

Come talk to me when your team can score more than 33 points in a game.  
LSU's basketball dynasty is officially over.  Oh, wait a minute.  It never 
began.  




Mississippi 50, LSU 33
		
 
OXFORD, Miss. (AP) _ Aaron Harper scored 16 points to lead No. 25 Mississippi 
to a 50-33 victory over Louisiana State on Wednesday night. 
Harper was the only player in double figures for the Rebels (18-4, 6-3 
Southeastern Conference), who won their fourth consecutive game exactly one 
year after their worst home loss in 40 years _ a 97-53 loss to LSU. 
Roland Dupree had 14 points and a game-high 11 rebounds for LSU (11-9, 1-8), 
which was held to fewer than 40 points for the first time since a 51-39 loss 
at Rice in 1948. 
The Rebels limited the Tigers to 12-of-43 shooting from the field and forced 
them into 25 turnovers. 
LSU also shot just 1-of-16 from 3-point range, but stayed close before the 
Rebels put it away with a decisive 19-4 run. 
LSU led only once, on Dupree's opening basket. Ole Miss answered with a 12-5 
run and never trailed again. Harper made three consecutive baskets to 
highlight the surge. 
The Rebels led 19-15 at halftime, but LSU pulled within 23-22 with 15:19 
remaining on a basket by Jermaine Williams. LSU never got any closer as Ole 
Miss went on its decisive 19-4 run in the next seven minutes. Harper sparked 
the surge with a pair of 3-pointers and two assists. 
LSU's DuPree got a technical foul during the run, following his protest of an 
offensive foul by teammate Torris Bright. 
Jason Harrison hit both technical foul free throws and Harper followed with a 
3-pointer to complete the run and give Ole Miss a 42-26 lead with 7:23 left.

Hey Shanna -

How was your weekend in Louisiana?  Did you and Eric have fun?  I'm emailing
because last weekend I was really sick and had to cancel dinner and dancing.
I went to the doctor and found out I had pneumonia.  I rescheduled dinner
for this Friday, so if you and Eric are free, I would love for the two of
you to come.  Dinner is at Lupe Tortilla at 8:30.  We'll probably go dancing
afterwards!

Let me know if you guys can come.

Take care -

I am fine with seeing more houses before buying but was thinking that it 
might be a good idea to get the ball rolling on the Mandell house (i.e. low 
ball contract). This does not mean that I am wanting to buy right away, but 
more of testing the market and resolve of sellers.  Let me know when you are 
available to see more houses.  I am free whenever, except for Saturday after

Just finished real estate school and learned a few things - well, my memory

I am busy today but let me know if you want to see anything Friday.  We

Hi Eric,

2405 Mandell looks really good.  HCAD app. $267500.
2401 Mandell sold on 8/29/00 for $279900 in 6 days.  These are Silvestri
townhomes which I think are a cut above Perry.  HCAD for 2402 (Perry) is
$271800, not much less than asking price.  This is a patio home.  How many
townhomes/patio homes would you estimate are on the street?  Do you want to
try to see 2405 also?  LU-M

Hello everyone -

This Friday some of my friends and I (and Michael of course) are getting
together to celebrate my birthday.  We're starting with dinner at Lupe
Tortilla at 8:30 pm and then most likely going to the Mercury Room.  We
might go to a few other places depending on who wants to do what.  I'm
pretty leniant as long as I get to dance!

I hope you all can make it.

Update:

The aggies have played and are awaiting a UT team challenger.    I think the 
only thing at stake here is the trophy and I don't know what there is terms 
of ref's, a field, etc.

If you would like to field a team to play the aggies, lemme know.   Webb has 
informed me that he does not have enough players and thus there will be no 
playoff for the Enron Texas team.  We can still put a team together by 
combining those of you who would like to play.  Otherwise, I think Texas made 
it's case after Thanksgiving and I'm not going to pursue this any further..

--
Webb, where are you as far as setting up a time with the aggies?    I think 
this weekend, either Saturday or Sunday is as good as any.  If not this 
weekend, you will need to organize this as I will be on vacation for the next 
two weeks.

READ THIS. LET IT REALLY  SINK IN.? THEN CHOOSE HOW YOU 
START YOUR DAY. 

Michael is the  kind of guy you love to hate. He is 
always in a good 
mood 
and  
always has something positive to say.? When someone 
would ask him  how 
he 
was 
doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would  
be twins!" 

He was a natural motivator.? If an employee was  having 
a bad day, 
Michael 
was there telling the employee how to look  on the 
positive side of the 
situation. 

Seeing this style really  made me curious, so one day I 
went up to 
Michael 
and asked him, "I  don't get it! You can't be a 
positive person all of 
the 
time.  
How do you do it?" 

Michael replied, "Each morning I wake up and say  to 
myself, you have 
two 
choices today.? You can choose to be in  a good mood 
or...you can choose? 
to 
be in a bad 
mood.?  I choose to be in a good mood.? Each time 
something bad happens, 
I  
can choose to be a victim or...I can choose to learn 
from it. I choose  
to 
learn from it. 
Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can  
choose to accept 
their 
complaining or...I can point out the positive  side of 
life. I choose 
the 
positive side of life. 

"Yeah,  right, it's not that easy," I protested. 

"Yes, it is," Michael said.  "Life is all about 
choices. When you cut 
away 
all the junk, every  situation is a choice. You choose 
how you react to 
situations. You  choose how people affect your mood. 
You choose to be in 
a 
good mood  or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your 
choice how you live 
your  
life." 

I reflected on what Michael said. Soon hereafter, I 
left  the Tower 
Industry 
to start my own business. We lost touch, but I often  
thought about him 
when 
I made a choice about life instead of  reacting to it. 

Several years later, I heard that Michael was involved  
in a serious 
accident, falling some 60 feet from a communications  
tower.? After 18 
hours 
of surgery and weeks of intensive care,  Michael was 
released from the 
hospital with rods placed in his back.  

I saw Michael about six months after the accident. 
When I asked him  how 
he 
was, he replied. "If I were any better, I'd be twins. 
Wanna  see my 
scars?" 

I declined to see his wounds, but I did ask him what  
had gone through 
his 
mind as the accident took place. "The first  thing that 
went through my 
mind 
was the well-being of my soon to be  born daughter, " 
Michael replied. 
"Then, 
as I lay on the ground, I  remembered that I had two 
choices: I could 
choose 
to live or ...I  could choose to die. I chose to live." 

"Weren't you scared? Did you lose  consciousness?" I 
asked. Michael 
continued, "...the paramedics were  great. They kept 
telling me I was 
going 
to be fine. But when they  wheeled me into the ER and I 
saw the 
expressions 
on the faces of the  doctors and nurses, I got really 
scared.? In their 
eyes, 
I read  "he's a dead man. I knew I needed to take 
action." 

"What did you  do?" I asked. 

"Well, there was a big burly nurse shouting questions  
at me," said 
Michael. 
"She asked if I was allergic to anything.  "Yes, I 
replied." The doctors 
and 
nurses stopped working as they  waited for my reply. I 
took a deep 
breath 
and 
yelled, "Gravity."  

Over their laughter, I told them, "I am choosing to 
live. Operate on  me 
as 
if I am alive, not dead." 

Michael lived, thanks to the  skill of his doctors, but 
also because of 
his 
amazing attitude. I  learned from him that every day we 
have the choice 
to 
live fully.  Attitude, after all, is everything. 
"Therefore do not worry 
about  tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. 

After all today is the  tomorrow you worried about 
yesterday. 

You have two choices now:  
1. Delete this. 
2. Forward it to the people you care about. 

You  know the choice I made. 

he will be taking it soon

x3-0977Hey Greg,

I mostly used the review course books.  You are welcome to borrow them if you 
like.  Otherwise, I am sure that either Kaplan or Princeton Review has some 
good books.  Check the AIMR website.

Bass,

Long time, no talk.  How's it going?  Hope the market is treating you well!

I have a question for you.  I am looking to take the CFA Level I test this 
summer.  I missed out on a review course I wanted to take.  I remember you 
said that you were taking the CFA, and I noticed you had a particular book 
you were studying.  I just wanted to see if you would recommend the book you 
studied.  If so, who produced it.

I saw Kaplan produces one, but I am not sure if it is any good.


I would really appreciate it.

Late,
GM

Subject: RE: Flag Football

Are you ready for some football!?!?!

I am trying to put together a flag football game this Sunday at 2:30 pm at 
Rice University.  I need YOUR help to pass this e-mail along to as many 
friends that you feel would be interested in friendly, competitive flag 
football.  If you are remotely interested, e-mail me your name and phone 
number, so I can create a contact list to pass out to everyone.  I don't have 
any flags or field cones, but if we get enough people interested, I'm sure 
Enron will sponsor us (if you have flags and/or cones, please bring them; 
I'll bring the football).

The location of our games will be at the practice field, East of the Rice U. 
stadium (across the parking lot).  I believe our playing field is on Rice 
University Blvd., between gates 12 and 13.  The field has two field goals and 
bleachers.  It's hard to miss!

I hope everyone is interested.  If not, we didn't need your slow, lazy, 
unathletic ass anyway...

My contact info is 713-345-7594.



dinner around 7ish will be fine - but we will come  out earlier to help out 
and have drinks

Hi Eric,

I don't think you want to look at it.  Notice that it is just one block from
the railroad tracks.  Talk about noise!

What time do you want to have dinner Saturday night?  I just got back from
the grocery store so everything is ready to prepare.  I will email Shanna
next.  Talk to you in a bit.  LU-M

ACCUSED MOLESTER PLEADS INNOCENT IN MONTANA COURT 
   A man accused of sexually molesting a 12-year-old boy, then killing
him and serving his body to his neighbors, has pleaded innocent in a
Great Falls, Mont., courtroom.
   Court records indicate that the man, Nathaniel Bar-Jonah, is a
career criminal. The 43-year-old is being held on half a million
dollars bond.
   Police say they found notes indicating that Bar-Jonah called dinners
cooked for friends and neighbors "little boy stews."
   He could face the death penalty if found guilty of murder and
several other charges, including impersonating a police officer.


Interesting read . . .

[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]

Two local men were seriously injured when their pickup truck left the road
and struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State Highway 38 early Monday
morning.

Woodruff County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident shortly after
midnight Monday.

Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are
listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred
as the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog-gigging trip.

On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights malfunctioned.
The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had
burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the
.22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to
the steering wheel column.

After inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly
and the two men proceeded toward the White River bridge. After traveling
about 20 miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently
overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle
swerved sharply right exiting the pavement and striking a tree.

Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident, but will
require surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a broken
clavicle and was treated and released.

"Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his balls off or we
might both be dead" stated Wallis.

"I've been a trooper for ten years in this part of the world, but this is a
first for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how this accident
happened," said Snyder.

Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife asked how many frogs
the boys had caught and did anyone get them from the truck.
Way to go, Lavinia)

It is at 8:30.  We are supposed to be there at 8 to get all seated together.
This is the Laff Spot on 249 and 1960.  Come up the Beltway and go left on
249.  Exit Greens road and go through two lights.  It will be in strip
shopping center on your right side, about a quarter of a mile past Circuit
City.  It is in the same shopping center as a bar called Frogs Saloon.

Addendum No. 1

To whom it may concern:

It has been brought to my attention that there are some people who are
interested in playing paintball games.  However, we were going to play this
weekend but there are a lot of people who are unable to play due to
previous engagements so we are going to reschedule it for Saturday, January
20, 2001.  It will cost about $22.00 and that includes admission for the
whole day, rental of the gun and one Co2 cartridge.  However, paintballs
are extra and they cost about $6.50 per 100.  If we do end up playing it
would be recommend to bring a sandwich and drinks because there is not much
out there.

If you could, please RSVP by Wednesday, January 17, 2001, that way we can
decide if we have enough people to even play.  Rain or Shine!

Thank you,

George Kissamis

Vietnamese War Refugee Becomes Successful 
Cookbook Author in America

Dulles, VA -- (Xpress Press)-- Successful 
Georgetown clothing designer Diana My Tran, 
celebrates the culture of her homeland in 
THE VIETNAMESE COOKBOOK, an easy-to-follow 
guide to Vietnamese cuisine.

In 1975 Diana Tran left Vietnam as part of 
a mass exodus when Saigon fell to Ho Chi 
Minh's North Vietnamese troops. The pregnant 
20-year-old had no idea where she was going 
or what she would do when she arrived, and 
was forced to make a new life for herself 
in a foreign country.  Over the past two 
decades she has gone from not knowing a word 
of English to being a successful clothing 
designer and dressmaker, with clients in the 
upper echelons of politics, media, and society.

Yet despite her success in America, Diana 
staunchly holds on to her Vietnamese heritage. 
"I want to keep our family heritage alive, es-
pecially for my children.  The easiest way to 
do that is through the food."  She says that 
when she first came to America, she missed the 
many joyous family celebrations and their acc-
ompanying feasts, and tried to recreate them 
for her new friends in America.

"When I first arrived in America, cooking 
Vietnamese dishes was a challenge, because 
there were no Asian food stores in Carlisle PA.  
Most of the time I could not find the tradi-
tional ingredients and had to make substitutions, 
but the food turned out just fine," she says. 
Diana recorded all of these substitutions in 
her cookbook, keeping the original tastes and 
textures. The recipes make use of ingredients 
easily found in local supermarkets, and show 
step-by-step instructions for making the healthy 
delights of Vietnamese cuisine fast and simply.

"My time for cooking is as limited as it ever 
was when I was a new immigrant," Tran says.  
"Traditional Vietnamese food can take time and 
effort to prepare-time I usually don't have, so 
I have created my own easier versions of Vietn-
amese dishes, tailored to the busy American 
lifestyle."

Diana's cookbook has been featured in The 
Washington Post, The Chicago Sun-Times, Charlotte 
Observer, Arkansas Democrat Gazette, and the 
Portland Press-Herald.   Diana has also appeared 
on Fox Noon News in Washington, DC and Poor Man's 
Kitchen in Seattle, WA. She is available for inter-
views about her family's flight from Saigon and her 
American success story.

Hi Jason,
?
Sorry I didn't see your message til late  yesterday.? I've been researching 
our family tree and have been totally  consumed.? I believe I've traced it 
back to 1658 on your Grandpa's  side.? Isn't that fascinating?? I began this 
project for you and Eric  but, in the process, I have become consumed.? It's 
very, very  interesting.? I will organize all of this in the future so you 
and your  brother have it.? Part of the inspiration came from a book Shanna 
gave me  for my birthday.? I started to fill in some of the blanks about our 
family  and couldn't remember what Grandpa had told me.? I was saddened by 
this and  now he is gone and I cannot ask him anymore.? So, I decided to do 
something  about it. Our old family bible from 1853 gave me a good starting  
point.
?
About your resume.? I think it is wonderfully  done.? I spoke with Dad and he 
told me about his comments to you.? I  agree.? There is so much more about 
you that is good.
?
Have a good day and I'll talk to you soon.?  I'm going to copy this to Eric 
so I don't have to write it all over.? Off  to the cemeteries I go!!
?
Love you, Mom

I made a few changes.  Generally when creating a resume, shorter is better
(preferably fitting on one page).  So most of my changes have been
consolidations.  Also, I tried to make the tenses of all of your bullet
points the same (you want to do this on all resumes and outlines).

As a side note, Shanna and I would like to take you and Donnita to dinner
on Friday at Pappasitos.  Can you make it?

Good evening Son. Seems like forever since we have  talked. Hope your week 
was good and next week is better. Lets get together for  lunch or dinner next 
week. Stay in touch. Love  you-Dad

shanna is meeting her family in dallas tomorrow, so she will not be alone.
tim is a friend of mine that went to lsu - i worked with him for about a year 
when i first started.  he had been dating his fiancee during college but they 
had broken up about a year ago.  he had been trying to get back together but 
i don't think he knew that he would get engaged over christmas.  i guess he 
had bought the ring in hopes of popping the question and when things went 
well over christmas he went ahead.

have a fun and safe weekend.

Hi E,

Glad to hear all is well with the exception of Toni, of course.  I am sorry
to hear of her unending heartache.  Tell Shanna I'm thinking of all of them.
Is her mother going to be there?

Which one is Tim?  Did you know he was getting engaged?

Have a good weekend.  Everything is good here.  We're going out tonight and
will meet Ken and Cheryl for dinner tomorrow night.

Things are well.  Just looking forward to the weekend.  We are going to
Happy Hour tonight to celebrate Tim's engagement.  Shanna is going to visit
Toni tomorrow, apparently she has taken a turn for the worse.  Other than

I am not a market maker in SWA vouchers, so you have my word that I will not 
sell them back.  Your bid for these vouchers is $250 in the market, my bid 
for bulk is $200,  I am willing to pay more.  I can already get to my 
destination for $250 - so maybe we can meet in the middle.

Let me know

Eric BassNow I see how you guys have been winning all of your games - through 
cheating.  You are supposed to have at least one player on IR each week.  A 
designated IR player cannot play.  There are no IR moves during the week.  
That means that at least one person on your team should score no points each 
week.

I've received the fund raising envelopes for the flag football tournament.   
I need everyone to pick these envelopes and begin collecting for UT.

I'm at 2918b or you can send me your location and I will  try to use the 
interoffice mail.

Alternatively, you can just solicit on your own without the envelope (which 
makes it more official).   Keep in mind that contributions will be matched by 
Enron and make checks payable to the University of Texas at Austin.  Last 
year we donated about $30 K to A&M Bonfire memorial scholarship efforts.  
Money collected this year will goto the general scholarship fund at UT.


Each team is expected to raise $2000  and we have less than 20 days left, so 
do your part.

---

Also, if anyone is interested in practicing this weekend or next, let me know 
and I will try to arrange it.  Webb's team is not practicing.


---

Finally, we're still short 2 guy players.

Don,

Sorry for the late notice, but I need to reschedule the meeting we have set 
up for tomorrow.  I can meet later in the day tomorrow or Friday afternoon at 
around 2:30 or later.

Let me know if you are available.

Subject: Re: FW: Big commitment  

I have said it 15 times already, but I will say it again.  Texas was 4-7 in 
the season prior to Mack Brown.  The program was in shambles .  Mack Brown 
came in late and was unable to salvage a recruiting class his first year.  Lo 
and behold Texas goes 9-3, beat Nebraska in Lincoln (No. 3 at the time with 
the longest home winning streak in recent history), and destroys Miss St in 
the Cotton Bowl.   Those sound like some big wins don't they?  Does it sound 
familiar?  I doubt you can compare the teams that LSU beat with the teams 
Texas beat.  So my point is that players get up for new coaches.  You, as LSU 
fans,  fans can expect about the same next year as this year.    
Next year, is Texas' year ( and I know what you will say " well that is what 
you say every year"), but Mack's first true recruits will be juniors and his 
first class (half his/half Mackovics) will be seniors.  So, if he doesn't win 
the big game next year, then you can call him a bad coach.  I have a problem 
saying he is  a bad coach after he has put together 3 straight 9 win seasons.

As a side note,  look who won the national championship game - the Big 12.  
If I am not mistaken, that makes the big 12 4-3  in the bowls while the Sec 
was 4-5.  If not for a bumbled extra point and a few dropped passes the 12 
would be 6-1 and the sec 3-6.  I see the beginnings of a new college fb 
powerhouse conference.  The Big 12 will win at least the next  2 NCs.

See ya

Looks like you guys have been having some fun during my absence.  I have a 
question:  How many top recruiting classes does it take for Texas to win a 
few big games in a single football season.  Dinnardo left LSU's recruiting 
program in shambles.  Last year was one of the worst recruiting seasons in 
LSU team history.  However, WE still managed to pull off some amazing team 
victories this year.

If there is one thing I learned from watching LSU this season, its that its 
nice to have talent on your team but its more important to have HEART and 
PRIDE.  So keep watching your Texas big names choke and I'll keep watching 
our TIGER No-Names win.

As Always, its all in Good Fun.

We got a huge commitment today from big Ben Wilkerson, center out of
Hemphill, TX.  He is rated by Rivals as the #1 lineman prospect in the
country, and it is very rare for a center to rate so high on their list.
They keep rolling in; Marcus Spears is expected to announce on Friday.

So, I guess we will plan on meeting at Kenneally's on Friday after work (say 
4:30 - 5).  

Tim - let me know if you want me to invite anyone else.
i just explained my logic - despite losing to OU earlier in the year texas is 
actually better than them.

see below

i am going to use a matt lenhart argument - alla texas lost to arkansas last 
year who lost to lsu.  . . .       texas played horribly against oregon and 
still had a great chance to win (and should have won) at the end of the 
game.  oregon beat washington who beat miami who beat fsu who should beat 
oklahoma tonite.  that means that texas should be national champions.

get real . . .  one 8-4 season after a decade of failure does not a 
championship caliber program make.  our team did the same thing right after 
mack arrived (9-3 with big win in cotton bowl) you can expect about the same 
next year.

lsu is getting some good recruits this year - you should be happy - in a 
couple of years your team will compete for sec and national championships.

but don't start talking smack after a win over a lousy ACC team.

Hi Eric,

I just got the only remaining reservations at RC's but they are at 5.  At
this point, I am sure that it will be next to impossible to get anything
else, anywhere else.  I have been trying to contact a new, local restaurant
near here but their line has been busy.  They do have a prix fixe menu
though, unlike RC's.  Let me know what you want to do.  LU-M  Have a great
trip and be careful.

Subject: Re: Trip to San Diego

My thoughts for the trip:

Friday:

Everyone says that you have to see the zoo if you are in San Diego.  Even- if 
you don't particularly like zoos.  Everything I read says that it will take 
at least half a day.  I say we hit that Friday morning through early 
afternoon.  Spend mid-afternoon near the hotel- beach area- suppose to be 
shopping, etc. near there.  Then go to the game.  When we get back that 
night- we can walk on the beach!

Saturday:

Visit Balboa Park.  See the Botanical Gardens, in other musuems/gardens in 
the area that look interesting.  If we aren't sick of seeing animals, there 
is suppose to be a wonderful Wild Animal Park that gives trolley or walking 
tours (the tours are only like an hour and a half).  After that- there is a 
ferry you can take across the bay to the Coronado Island to see the Hotel del 
Coronado.  It is suppose to be a really neat place.  Then- you we can finish 
the day in the Gaslamp Quarter downtown.  It is suppose to have a "lively 
evening street scene" and live music.

What do you think?  Let me know- so I can look up times that all of these 
open- if we are interested.

Hi Dearest,

Yes, 2001 will be better.  I have an appt. for a complete physical on Jan.
3.  Why don't you call and get your lab work done that day and we'll go for
lunch?

Yes, New Year's Eve sounds good with the boys.  I sent you messages from
both the boys.  Isn't it nice that they, independent of each other, think of
spending New Year's Eve with us?  That makes me feel good.  I can't think of
anybody I'd rather spend the evening with than my wonderful men and the
boys' signficant others.

SWCC would be fine.  Also, Ruth Chris' but that would be pricey.  I had
originally thought that the little Mexican place on 90A could cater some
food.  They're good and I just thought of that place we just read about -
Cafe what's her name on 90A.  But, by far, the easiest and least expensive,
I think, would be SWCC.

I thought you all might find this an interesting read.  Sorry, the
complaint form wasn't very user friendly - I guess the person that designed
the
form is the same that hired there ticketing help.

-E

To whom it may concern:

I recently returned from a wonderful vacation to Telluride.  It was
wonderful except for the fact that I traveled on your airline.

I was originally supposed to leave out of IAH at 6:05 AM on 12/9/00 for
Phoenix and catch a 10:00 AM connection to Telluride
(the only flight of the day from Phoenix to Telluride).  Unfortunately, the
flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because
of foggy conditions in the Houston area.  I do not blame America West for
this; It is understandable to cancel this flight because of
the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions. There is, however, no
danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which
leads me to the point of this complaint.  Your ticketing staff in IAH was
less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline
(Continental/United/American had several flights that could have delivered
us to Phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that
we could make our connection.  Instead, we were told that it was impossible
to find a flight that could get us to Phoenix in time for this
connection.  Subsequently, I called other airlines and confirmed space on
flights that would have  delivered us to Phoenix on time.
It now appears that America West was more willing to sacrifice a day of my
vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.
I am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; Because we missed
our connection we were forced to spend a combined
6 hrs in the Phoenix and Houston airports and eventually fly into Montrose,
CO where we had to drive 100 miles to Telluride.  Instead
of arriving in Telluride, Co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten
hours later.  This delay caused the waste of one full day of
vacation.  Myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again
because of this experience.

For your research I provide the following data:
Persons in Party - Eric Bass, Larry Bass, Kathy Bass, Jason Bass, Shanna
Husser, and Donnita Franklin.

Final Itinerary (after all changes) -
Flt. 2765 Dec. 09 Iah-Phx 8:51AM

Subject: Chili Taster


Notes From An Inexperienced Chili Taster Named FRANK, who was
visiting Texas from the East Coast:

Recently I was honored to be selected as an outstanding Famous
celebrity in Texas, to be a judge at a chili cook-off, because no one
else
wanted to do it. Also the original person called in sick at the last
moment,
and I happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking
directions
to the beer wagon when the call came. I was assured by the other two
judges (Native Texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy, and
besides
they told me I could have free beer during the tasting, so I accepted.

Here are the scorecards from the event:

Chili # 1: Mike's Maniac Mobster Monster Chili

JUDGE ONE: A little too heavy on tomato. Amusing kick.
JUDGE TWO: Nice, smooth tomato flavor. Very mild.
FRANK: Holy cow, what the hell is this stuff? You could remove dried
               paint from your driveway with it. Took me two beers to
put the
               flames out. Hope that's the worst one. These Texans are
crazy.

Chili # 2: Arthur's Afterburner Chili

JUDGE ONE: Smoky, with a hint of pork. Slight Jalapeno tang.
JUDGE TWO: Exciting BBQ flavor, needs more peppers to be taken
                        seriously.
FRANK: Keep this out of reach of children! I'm not sure what I am
               supposed to taste besides pain. I had to wave off two
people
               who wanted to give me the Heimlich maneuver. They had to
               walkie-talkie in 3 extra beers when they saw the look on
my face.

Chili # 3: Fred's Famous Burn Down the Barn Chili

JUDGE ONE: Excellent firehouse chili! Great kick. Needs more beans.
JUDGE TWO: A beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of red peppers.
FRANK: Call the EPA, I've located a uranium spill. My nose feels like I
               have been snorting Drano. Everyone knows the routine by
now.
               Barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the

               front part of my chest. I'm getting drunk.

Chili # 4: Bubba's Black Magic

JUDGE ONE: Black bean chili with almost no spice. Disappointing.
JUDGE TWO: Hint of lime in the black beans. Good side dish for fish or
                        other mild foods, not much of a chili.
FRANK: I felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to
               taste it. Sally, the bar maid, was standing behind me
with fresh refills;
               that 300 lb. witch is starting to look HOT, just like
this nuclear-waste
               I'm eating.

Chili # 5: Linda's Legal Lip Remover

JUDGE ONE: Meaty, strong chili. Cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding
                       considerable kick. Very impressive.
JUDGE TWO: Chili using shredded beef; could use more tomato. Must admit
                        the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.
FRANK: My ears are ringing, and I can no longer focus my eyes. I farted
               and four people behind me needed paramedics. The
contestant
               seemed offended when I told her that her chili had given
me brain
               damage. Sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring
beer directly
               on it from a pitcher. It really pisses me off that the
other judges asked
               me to stop screaming.  Rednecks!

Chili # 6: Vera's Very Vegetarian Variety

JUDGE ONE: Thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. Good balance of spice

                       and peppers.
JUDGE TWO: The best yet. Aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic.
                        Superb.
FRANK: My intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous,
sulfuric
               flames. No one seems inclined to stand behind me except
big Sally.
               I need to sooth my butt with a snow cone!

Chili # 7: Susan's Screaming Sensation Chili

JUDGE ONE: A mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.
JUDGE TWO: Ho Hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of
chili
                        peppers at the last moment. I should note that I
am worried
                       about Judge Number 3. He appears to be in a bit
of distress
                       as he is cursing uncontrollably.
FRANK: You could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and I wouldn't

                feel a damn thing. I've lost the sight in one eye, and
the world sounds
                like it is made of rushing water. My shirt is covered
with chili which
                slid unnoticed out of my mouth. My pants are full of
lava-like stuff to
                match my damn shirt. At least during the autopsy they'll
know what
                killed me. I've decided to stop breathing, it's too
painful. Screw it, I'm
                not getting any oxygen anyway. If I need air, I'll just
suck it in through
                the 4 inch hole in my stomach.

Chili # 8: Helen's Mount Saint Chili

JUDGE ONE: A perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all,
not too bold
                       but spicy enough to declare its existence.
JUDGE TWO: This final entry is a good, balanced chili, neither mild nor
hot. Sorry
                        to see that most of it was lost when Judge
Number 3 passed out,
                        fell and pulled the chili pot on top of himself.
Not sure if he's going
                        to make it. Poor Yank.
FRANK: --------------(editor's note: Judge #3 was unable To report)

With the points, I should have 132 and a victory over the Snake Pit... As it

you are interested, call 713-267-5075 for  reservations.? Just thought I'd

I hope we can see you this weekend.? Are you  going to Austin?? We have 
plenty of time to look at the clothes.? She  ought to have a couple of weeks,

Talk to you later.? Have a great day.?  LU-M

May I have your attention, please!!

<ahem>

Just wanted everyone to know that Texas was voted #1 by Playboy magazine for
"Colleges with the Best Looking Girls".  As if we needed affirmation of this
fact...

But, now, we have full-fledged proof to show the world where it's at.

I've never been prouder to say, "Hook 'em Horns!!"

This comes from playboy.com

The List:

1.  The University of Texas
2.  Arizona State
3.  UCLA
4.  University of Florida
5.  University of Arizona
6.  Florida State
7.  University of Alabama
8.  University of Colorado
9.  East Carolina
10. University of Georgia



Hey Michael,

I just wanted to confirm my position on the team.  I know you have already 
talked to Luis Mena about putting together a team, and I would like to be on 
that team.

Hopefully this year we can practice a little more and take home the 
championship.

Hook 'em.

I guess you just summed up the difference between our two programs - at Texas 
we play for National Championships  at LSU you play to make the Sharpie 
Independence bowl.  Yes we were rated in the top 10 at the beginning of the 
year and yes we are rated #20 now.  You forget that we are only half way 
through the season - we will be in the top 10 again before the year is out.  
Where will LSU be?  Besides we weren't supossed to play in the Orange Bowl 
this year ( this is only Mack Brown's 3rd year), but anything less than the 
Rose Bowl nest year will be dissapointing.

See you in Pasadena 2002

Easy there Superfan!  Remember, you still have to win 1 of your last 3 games, 
none of those are gimmes (see UAB).  As far as bowls go,  LSU to the Cotton 
Bowl? Come on, the Sharpie Independence Bowl is more likely (although UT will 
probably join you).  In addition, a sweep would never happen if you were 
lucky enough to face UT - can you say better QB, RBs, WRs, and Defense.  
Besides, we have turned the corner after our embarrassing loss to OU (the #2 
team in the country). I feel pretty good about our chances the rest of the 
way. 

 Face it, the SEC is having a down year.  It happens to all Conferences.  
It's just that this down year has enabled LSU a few chances to tear down the 
goalposts (and against the #11 team in the country - how sad is that).  

 And far be it from me to defend the Aggies, but which school was the one to 
back out of that contract a few years back?

See you in the Shreveport.

Final Score 
UT - 58
LSU - 3

Subject: It could happen!!!

There are some pretty interesting college football predictions flying around! 
After their incredible victory last Saturday night, some folks have LSU going 
to the Cotton Bowl this year.  I would love to see LSU sweep UT this year in 
yet one more major college sport-------basketball (NCAA tournament), baseball 
(College World Series), and, yes, football in the Cotton Bowl this year.  
However, it would be just as sweet to wip up on our old football 
nemesis---The Aggies.  Although I think the Tigers would have to be a little 
more careful, since the Aggies occasionally spice up their offense with a 
crazy "REEEEEEEE-Verse" play or maybe even a pass on first down.

We can only hope that one of these situations occur!

Easy there Superfan!  Remember, you still have to win 1 of your last 3 games, 
none of those are gimmes (see UAB).  As far as bowls go,  LSU to the Cotton 
Bowl? Come on, the Sharpie Independence Bowl is more likely (although UT will 
probably join you).  In addition, a sweep would never happen if you were 
lucky enough to face UT - can you say better QB, RBs, WRs, and Defense.

To whom it may concern:

In previous years Enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's 
employees.  I have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag 
football.  In addition, Enron has been very invloved with charitable 
organizations in the community.  With these two things in mind, I wanted to 
propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion.  I 
know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including 
flag football) recently.  This is a way that Enron can support employee 
interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community.

My questions are : Is this idea plausible?  If so, who should I contact with 
regards to setting up the tournament?


Thanks in advance,


Eric Bass

Subject: Gorons

Don't know who you're voting for, but here some things you might want to 
consider-


What is a Goron

   1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his own farm:
a polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income last
year.

   2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is antismoking and anti-tobacco
when  he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted government
subsidies.

   3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in fact
he was  placed by family influence in a "cushy"  correspondent's job and
the only  action he saw was that of his Brownie camera! (and his bong)

   4. Gorons actually believe that Mr. Gore is justified in illegally
raising political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt Law  educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

   5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al to accept large sums
of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had taken vows
of poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

   6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "invent the
Internet" would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks
of potentially  incriminating e-mail!

   7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the models for the book and movie, "Love Story" even though the book's
author,  Erich Segal, says not.

   8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars in Occidental Petroleum stock.

   9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent on the subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton "one of
the greatest Presidents of our history."

   10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
ineffective  that it has led to the election of Republicans as BOTH of
Tennessee's  Senators!

   11.  Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he served
to the poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum  house that he was renting to them.

   CAUTIONARY NOTE: Medical researchers acknowledge that Gorons are
generally harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately, overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to
actually vote for Gore! They should be carefully protected from their
ailment, since it may be  harmful to their well-being, yours, mine and
that of the USA.

   Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out to
aid the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and,  PLEASE, pass this on to
your normal  friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.

 Too often, we lose sight of life's simple pleasures.
 Remember, when someone annoys you it takes 42 muscles in your face to frown
BUT, it only takes 4 muscles to extend your arm and bitch-slap the

Jason,

I'd like to help you out this month but I just made a big expenditure on an 
exercise machine myself.  So, it will have to wait until at least next month.

ThanksGary,

We are still in the determination phase as far as what we are willing to 
sell.  Obviously, we would like to sell as close to the 10 yr average as 
possible. However, given the recent warmth of the past few winters and the 
forecsts,  this is probably an unrealistic goal.  I will get back to you by 
the end of the week with an acceptable target.

Subject: hobby jan-mar structure

Eric,

I've put a Jan-Mar Hobby $10,000/$2 million swap offer in the market of 635 
HDDs.  635 is the 10 year average.  Given the forecasts for normal to warm in 
the Gulf area this winter - with particular emphasis on warmth in the Jan-Mar 
period - I anticipate that bids will come back, initially, around 560 - and 
that we might be able to sell a swap around 585.  As a frame of reference, 
last year (2000) came in at 412.5 HDDs and 1999 came in at 429.5 HDDs.

What kind of number are you looking for  - do you want to leave an order with 
me where you'd be willing to sell the swap?

If you're interested in buying an option, perhaps you'd like to put a bid out 
on the following structure:

Hobby
Jan-Mar
$15,000/HDD
$2,700,000 Limit
560 strike (1/2 standard deviation from the 10 year average)

I imagine you could get this option for approx. $750,000.  The same option 
with a $2,000,000 limit would go for about $100,000 less.

Let me know your thoughts.

Regards,
Gary

Contrary to popular belief, the people that actually show up to the game do 
have other things they can do if they know that the other team members will 
not show up.  So, let me know whether or not you will be there.

When are you running for office Eric, you have my vote.

Dan,

I work for Tom Martin on the Texas Gas Trading Desk and he has some questions 
on EOL "Force Majeure" language.  Specifically, we buy/sell gas at the Exxon 
Katy Plant and were wondering the "Force Majeure" ramifications of the the 
Plant closing due to freeze-offs, i.e. can we claim Force Majeure in that 
instance and what remedies are provided for in the EOL contract language?  
Additionally, we buy/sell gas at HPL pooling points such as Agua Dulce Pool 
and were curious about the Force Majeure provisions and remedies for these 
pooling zones.  

I do not know if you are the right person to contact regarding this 
information, but if you can provide any insight I would greatly appreciate it.


Thanks in advance.

Sincerely,

Eric Bass
x3-0977You are all just envious of the relationships that I have develped with the 
other fantasy owners, that enable me to help improve both teams through trade 
:)

Do you want to do another season of fantasy basketball?  This season, please 
don't let Bass rip you off for your best players.

We got another big name recruit - that will probably amount to nothing with 
our conservative, shitty Offensive Coordinator.

How were the flowers?  Exotic?  I didn't get to see a live picture of them

Hi Eric,

I am really getting worried.  I was sitting down to
send you a message to thank you for the gorgeous
flowers and to tell you that "you are your father's
son".  In the meantime, I received that hillarious
e-card from you.  You guessed it - your father sent me
the very same card!!!  You two are amazing.

Thank you for the card and the flowers.  I love you,
too, and I will ALWAYS be here for you.  Mom

Subject: A Computer and Internet Connection for You and Your Family

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=
l=20
continue to do so in the future. Technology has helped Enron create new=20
businesses like Enron Broadband Services and Enron Net Works, and it is=20
responsible for applications such as EnronOnline and EnronCredit.com.  You=
=01,ve=20
seen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20
realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=
he=20
ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=
=20
your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=
=20
http://clickathome.enron.com.  We will schedule an eSpeak session in the ne=
ar=20
future where you will have an opportunity to ask questions. Or, you can=20
submit your questions and comments to ClickAtHome@enron.com.=20

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20
family.  We believe this program takes communication at Enron to a new leve=
l=20
by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=
=20
the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=

Enron is a great place to work.

second half to grind out the clock and keep the score closer. But he said h=
e=20
was foolish enough to think his team could come back, so UT tried to throw=

Give us the answers, Chip. What are the coaches' comments on these  topics?=
=20
=09?? Cody Anderson, Houston=20
=09
=09BROWN: I think I've pretty much answered the Hayter question. The runnin=
g=20
game became somewhat irrelevant in the OU game pretty quickly because UT wa=
s=20
forced to pass to try to get back in it. But Hodges Mitchell did get a lot =
of=20
time, mostly because he ran for 204 yards in last year's OU game and becaus=
e=20
he is the bigger receiving threat. Look for Hayter to get more carries this=

week. It's hard to believe that Shaun Rogers makes that big of a difference=
,=20
but Casey Hampton said UT would have gotten more pressure on Heupel if Roge=
rs=20
was in there. Rogers is expected to play this week. The 5-yard patterns,=20
according to offensive coordinator Greg Davis, are the routes that the=20

he=20
was on. The biggest problem for Texas right now is no leadership on offense=
.=20
Giving the offensive reins to Major Applewhite this week is a great move, I=
=20
believe. It could give the Longhorns confidence, if it's not too late and t=
he=20
offensive psyche hasn't been beaten down too much. The offensive line has n=
o=20
vocal, emotional leaders. Antwan Kirk-Hughes is developing into that guy. B=
ut=20
none of the other guys are fiery, vocal guys. And Applewhite has been an=20
ineffective leader to this point because he has been so worried about wheth=
er=20
he is going to play well enough to stay in a game with this QB rotation.=20
Coaches can only do so much when it comes to leadership on the field. You=
=20
can't make a guy do more pushups and make him into a leader. That stuff is=
=20
inherent in players. Either you have it or you don't. On defense, Casey=20
Hampton and Shaun Rogers are the heart and soul. On special teams Beau Trah=
an=20
needs to take command. On offense, it's clearly Applewhite who will have to=
=20
step up. Maybe the end of the QB rotation will help him do that.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Is it obvious to just fans or everyone that the Texas coaches fail to =
have=20
the team prepared each week and fail to provide the opponent with a new =20
wrinkle or two each week? The opposing team always seems to know what is=20
coming while Texas is always caught by surprise early on. On offense, the=
=20
play-calling is extremely predictable and increasingly  uncreative. On=20
defense, the opponents used what worked in previous weeks against Texas and=
=20
the defense never seems to have made an adjustment. The defense uses the sa=
me=20
blitzes without mixing things up enough. Both coach Reese and coach Davis=
=20
seem extremely stubborn and refuse to try something new for fear of a mista=
ke=20
or setback. Well, we have suffered both, so why not give the players some=
=20
excitement and give the opposing team some uncomfortable feeling while on t=
he=20
sideline after seeing something totally new? It seemed to work against OSU=
=20
with a little different blocking scheme. Good job but do it every week,=20
especially against the tougher opponents. Do you see these problems and=20
tendencies also?=20
=09?? Todd Purl=20
=09
=09BROWN: In talking to Greg Davis on Tuesday, he said he is re-evaluating =
his=20
play calling and has questioned himself about the creativity of it. Texas h=
as=20
done well in the shotgun, four-wide, one-minute offense. But Davis said jus=
t=20
using that set goes against their philosophy of trying to be balanced 50-50=
=20
with the run and the pass. At some point, and maybe this week, if that line=
=20
can't open any holes for the backs, it will be time to give up hopes of bei=
ng=20
balanced and throw the ball out of four wides and use the pass to set up th=
e=20
run. We'll see if things improve this week. There is no question that the=
=20
coaches are rethinking EVERYTHING right now. Davis also said he has gotten=
=20
after the offense for all the penalties that have been killing early drives=
.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:I am a Longhorn fan who tries to be realistic. Win alot, lose some -- =
be=20
realistic. One thing that is very disturbing to me now, above winning and=
=20
losing, is the following: After the last four big games, some Longhorn has=
=20
said "the other team just wanted it more" After Oklahoma, it was Hodges=20
Mitchell who said it. I remember reading the same comments after Arkansas a=
nd=20
Nebraska. Why do you think our players are not as hungry as our opponents? =
Or=20
is it the players will not give it up for Mack Brown as the Sooners might =
=20
for Bob Stoops, the Hogs do for their coach, etc. =20
=09?? Mike Engelman=20
=09
=09BROWN: This is an interesting question and one that I think is very tell=
ing.=20
When Texas was the underdog or was still surging from the depths of 4-7 und=
er=20
the new attitude brought in by Mack Brown, the Longhorns got up for teams=
=20
like Nebraska (1998 and 1999) and Texas A=02?(1998) and won. But now that T=
exas=20
is the favorite in every game, the Longhorns are struggling. Even though=20
Brown built North Carolina into a national power by the end of his tenure=
=20
there, the Tar Heels were never expected to win a national title. But with=
=20
everything Brown has done to stir up interest and belief in Texas (recruiti=
ng=20
star players, beating Nebraska twice, re-establishing tradition), he will b=
e=20
expected to contend for a national title here in the very near future. So h=
e=20
has to find ways to get his team on edge for games such as OU, even when th=
e=20
Sooners have every reason to beat the Longhorns. The past five losses have=
=20
all come against teams who appeared to have more reasons to beat UT than UT=
=20
had to beat them - Texas A=02?(revenge and the bonfire tragedy), Nebraska (=
had=20
been beaten by UT three straight times), Arkansas (finally back in the Cott=
on=20
Bowl, looking to beat its old rival), Stanford (coming off 69-17 loss to UT=
=20
in 1999) and Oklahoma (loser of three straight to UT). If Texas has any hop=
e=20
of fending off teams looking to make a name for themselves with a win over=
=20
Texas, Brown will have to find ways to equalize the incentive factor and ma=
ke=20
his team more hungry. Again, some of that will have to come from leadership=
=20
among players. Some of it will be Mack Brown reinventing himself or=20
constantly arousing the senses of his players in different ways.=20

=09Greg Davis=20
=09
=09Q:It was quite obvious from watching the game Saturday that we were=20
thoroughly outplayed in all phases of the game. Even more disappointing is=
=20
the fact that we were thoroughly outcoached, too. I am convinced that are=
=20
offensive schemes will continue to be inconsistent, at best, against the=20
better defenses in the country. To support my argument, I reviewed the last=
=20
seven games (including this one) we have played against "good" defenses=20
(K-State, Nebraska twice, A&M, Arkansas, OSU, OU). The results are terrible=
.=20
We have averaged 216 passing yards per game (would rank
=09
=09 54th in the country in 2000) and 52 rushing yards per game (112th in th=
e=20
country in 2000). Our total offense of 268 yards per game would rank 99th i=
n=20
the country in 2000. Although this review could be construed as overly=20
conservative, it still makes my point that our offense is well below averag=
e=20
when facing better defenses. I feel like Greg Davis is getting too much=20
credit for our offensive output against bad defenses, resulting in a failur=
e=20
to see the inherent weaknesses in our scheme. I would like your comments on=
=20
this prevailing problem and I would also like to know where Kenny Hayter wa=
s=20
on Saturday!  Thanks,=20
=09?? Lane=20
=09
=09BROWN: I tend to think that Davis does need to mix things up a little bi=
t=20
more. Perhaps by having one QB running the offense, things will settle down=
,=20
and some more offensive flow will result. I think the answers may begin=20
there. Perhaps if Applewhite can get things moving without fear of being=20
yanked, the confidence will spread everywhere, including the booth where=20
plays are being called. Without question, when a team is struggling, the=20
tendency is to simplify. Well, UT can't afford to simplify its offense=20
anymore.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Why did the coaching staff remove, or go away from, the quick-strike, =
no-=20
huddle offense that was used in the first game? The team seemed to come =20
alive when they began using that offense, along with the appearance of Majo=
r =20
Applewhite. I believe if this offense would have been used against Stanford=
, =20
the team would have been unbeaten going into OU. The quick-strike offense =
=20
did not make another appearance until a dire situation in the OU game. Then=
 =20
when the Horns used it, they moved the ball down the field and scored. Why=
=20
not  use this more and keep the defense guessing? Unlike most coaches, I=20
believe  with this style of offense, the pass will set up the run, and we a=
ll=20
would  love to see a consistent running game.=20
=09?? Brian Gannon=20
=09
=09BROWN: I will quote Greg Davis when I asked him the same question: "The=
=20
one-minute offense creates a tempo. It forces the game to go up-tempo becau=
se=20
it's a situation where everything is done at the line. The argument against=
=20
using it as a standard offense is that it goes against our overall philosop=
hy=20
of being balanced, 50-50, with the run and the pass."=20
=09?
=09
=09Q:The OU game was an unmitigated disaster from start to finish with no=
=20
redeeming features  whatsoever which sets the program back at least a year,=
=20
if not more. So tell us something good, Chip ... PLEASE! =20
=09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20
=09
=09BROWN: Again, if Texas wins this week, the Longhorns are back in the dri=
ver's=20
seat for the Big 12 South, in my opinion. I would be surprised if Texas=20
doesn't bounce back with its best effort of the season. If there is a clear=
=20
hangover, and Texas loses, it will be time to take the bad with the good. F=
or=20
every 1998 storybook season, there is a season where everything doesn't fal=
l=20
into place as expected. But let's see what happens this week. The effects o=
f=20
the OU game won't set the program back a year unless the Longhorns let it. =
If=20
UT bounces back this week and wins, the Longhorns have a pretty good schedu=
le=20
to get to the A=02?game with only one league loss. Let's see what happens.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:You stated that every QB would benefit from a redshirt year unless the=
y=20
were Michael Vick. Michael Vick redshirted at Virginia Tech and benefited=
=20
greatly from it. It was even his idea. They made a pretty big deal about it=
=20
last year.=20
=09?? Brad Livingston=20
=09
=09BROWN: I stand corrected. But even in my error, I proved my point. I sai=
d all=20
freshmen benefit from a redshirt year, and Chris Simms probably would have,=
=20
too. I should have stated that Vick is the perfect example. Thank you for=
=20
setting the record straight.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:It seems as though Major Applewhite has a better connection with the=
=20
receivers than Chris Simms does. Do you think this is legit or is it merely=
=20
coincidence since Simms has been starting and the receivers are cold, but=
=20
Applewhite comes into the heat of the game when everyone has started to run=
=20
on all cylinders? Also, why is the coaching staff giving Simms every chance=
=20
to win the starting position when it is obvious to fans, coaches, and=20
opponents that Applewhite is the leader and the one to watch out for? Surel=
y=20
if Simms lives up to his pedigree as everyone hopes, he wouldn't have his=
=20
feelings hurt if he lost the starting job to someone superior to him.=20
=09?? Brandon May=20
=09
=09BROWN: Simms said this week that if the coaches went solely with Applewh=
ite,=20
he could live with it as long as it was best for the team. He said he has=
=20
been pressing and that interceptions have become a regular negative in his=
=20
play. He said the grade he would give himself this season would be terrible=
.=20
But he says, in his heart, he believes he will show everyone the promise th=
at=20
has been expected of him since leaving high school as the nation's top QB=
=20
prospect.=20

=09Q:What role is Courtnee Garcia playing this year on the football team? I=
s=20
Miguel McKay on the football team?=20
=09?? Poorun Patel, Lufkin=20
=09
=09BROWN: Courtnee Garcia fell way behind after pulling a hamstring in the=
=20
pre-season. He hasn't been able to capture sizable playing time as yet. And=
=20
he lost his punt return duties to Hodges Mitchell and has even fallen behin=
d=20
Nathan Vasher as a backup in that role. So Garcia needs to try to convince=
=20
the coaches in practice that he deserves some playing time and then make th=
e=20
most of it. Otherwise, there may not be enough snaps at split end (Garcia's=
=20
position) behind Roy Williams and Montrell Flowers. Miguel McKay is on the=
=20
team and got playing time at defensive tackle against OU. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Since all of the big programs are operating under the same recruiting=
=20
restraints, I don't think its unreasonable to expect more out of the recrui=
ts=20
that Texas has. UT has had as good of a haul of recruits over the last 3-4=
=20
years as any program in the country. Using the logic that has been offered =
up=20
by some UT followers, we should be patient and wait until next year or the=
=20
next. At that point, we will be waiting for the inexperienced defensive=20
tackles to mature ... or some other aspect of the team. I don't know where=
=20
the actual difference between the dominant programs and UT is, but I would=
=20
guess that it has something to do with getting "senior" performance from=20
underclassmen. Whether that is a product of the recruiting or motivation, I=
=20
don't know. What do you think?=20
=09?? Kevin P. McCarthy=20
=09
=09BROWN: I think it's fair to expect a lot from this team next year with t=
he=20
schedule UT has. And once Texas shows that it can crack the top 10 without=
=20
losing before the end of October, and if Mack Brown can keep getting star=
=20
high school recruits, the Longhorns will be expected to be in the top 10 fr=
om=20
then on. So starting next year, I think it's fair to put Texas in the top 1=
0=20
and expect them to stay there all season. The UT Towers freshmen receiving=
=20
corps will have a year of experience. Leonard Davis will be gone from the=
=20
O-line, but Robbie Doane should be a suitable replacement, and UT will have=
=20
all its running backs back except for Hodges Mitchell. The defense will los=
e=20
two first-round NFL draft picks (Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers), but Marcu=
s=20
Tubbs and Stevie Lee should be suitable replacements. The senior leadership=
=20
in other areas will have to make up for the loss of this year's key seniors=
.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:The addition of Roy Williams has helped Major Applewhite open up the=
=20
offense because he is a big-play receiver. As a supporter of the Garland=20
Owls, I got to witness B.J. Johnson in a big-game situation in last year's=
=20
semi-final game. He was an awesome player last year until that semi-final=
=20
game. Will he be as big of a threat as Roy Williams? =20
=09?? Tyrance "Duke" Barnett, Garland, Texas=20
=09
=09BROWN: I think both of these guys will be outstanding. And more importan=
tly,=20
their leadership will be needed on this offense beginning Saturday. As Mack=
=20
Brown says, freshmen are only freshmen until mid-season. Then they have to =
be=20
and play like upperclassmen. But Williams and Johnson will both be=20
outstanding, in my opinion.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09Q:Mack Brown should be HEAVILY criticized for his poor handling of the Q=
B=20
situation. Major Applewhite has never done anything but show he is one of t=
he=20
most confident, proven leaders from the QB position in the nation. In my=20
opinion, not even his injury or the fact that Chris Simms got a lot of reps=
=20
in the spring warranted even a thought of him having to share time. You can=
=20
say what you want, and Brown would obviously talk around this, but we would=
=20
not have lost the Stanford game if Applewhite had started and played the=20
entire game. Both QBs, and the offense as a whole, have not played up to th=
e=20
level they're capable of playing because of the inconsistency at QB. A QB=
=20
controversy creates doubt and a lack of confidence for everyone involved. T=
he=20
coaches, media and fans have fallen in love with an unproven commodity, all=
=20
the while shucking aside an individual who did everything possible to prove=
=20
he should be the starter. Mack Brown's job is to be above that, and it's ti=
me=20
for him to take the heat. The media and fans are touching on this, but I=20
think it's time to tell it like it is with his illogical, failed and unfair=
=20
experiment.=20

Eric -  
We cannot delete meter #3537 from this particular Product Description since 
Products using this product location have already been transacted on 
(including Transaction #33491).   

Therefore, we will need to either create a new location name (what would be 
the "new" location name?) or we can advise the customers via a ticker  
message that the Product description for "HPL/AguaD" has been revised.    
Unfortunately, we are working through some issues with the ticker message 
system, but we have been advised that it will be in place soon.  Are you able 
to postpone until the ticker system is operable?

Please advise.

=09
=09 "We're excited about the position we're in being 4-0, and we're a confi=

team going down to Dallas. We are more mature. We understand more. We play=

harder and are better conditioned and stronger than a year ago."=20

=09
=09 "Turnovers were a major factor. We had two interceptions that hit us ri=
ght=20
in the chest and we drop. Both of those interceptions led to scores for=20
them."=20
=09
=09 On UT's quarterback rotation:=20
=09
=09 "I don't bother to speculate why they do something or not. They run the=
 same=20
offense with both (Major) Applewhite and (Chris) Simms. I'm sure we'll see =
a=20
good part of Applewhite. I know who our starting quarterback will be, and=
=20
he'll be in there the whole go unless something happens."=20
=09
=09 On OU's running game:=20
=09
=09 "I hope our running game is a factor in this game. We're quite a bit mo=
re=20
confident in our running game because we've emphasized it."=20
=09
=09 On going up, 17-0, in the first quarter and then losing last year's gam=
e,=20
38-28:=20
=09
=09 "We set the tone early last year and didn't finish the tone. There's no=
=20
protecting a lead for three quarters. And Major Applewhite made some throws=
,=20
you watch on film, that you can't believe."=20
=09

 to=20

=09
=09

=09Longhorn Q & A=20
=09 Q: I heard rumors that the Royal-Memorial Stadium will one day be the =
=20
largest stadium in terms of seating capacity in the country, seating some =
=20
114,000 folks. What's the chance of this happening in the near term? =20
=09 ?? Waxer, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Well, former UT regent Tom Hicks (owner of the Dallas Stars and=
=20
Texas Rangers) wants it done and is willing to help pay for it, so there is=
 a=20
good chance some movement on this could happen in the next few years. UT=20
would start by expanding and closing in the north end of Royal-Memorial. Th=
en=20
the focus would turn to the south end.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Kalen Thornton =20
=09
=09Q: What happened to Adam Doiron?=20
=09?? Morris W. Collie, Houston=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Adam Doiron was initially projected by UT defensive coordinator=
 Carl=20
Reese to be the top defensive end of the freshman class. He thought Doiron=
=20
would be the best run stopper of the bunch, and since that's an area Texas=
=20
wants to improve, Reese figured Doiron might play early on. But DE Kalen=20
Thornton moved ahead of Doiron during the pre-season, and now Reese is=20
considering redshirting Doiron. Doiron recently started working at defensiv=
e=20
tackle, and if any more players go down at that position, Doiron could see=
=20
playing time. The coaches like him, but might want to build for the future =
by=20
holding him out this season.=20
=09
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I was very happy to see some positive things from our offense in the=
 =20
second half, especially the running of Kenny Hayter, but I have a  question=
=20
about the punt team.=20
=09
=09It's obvious that opposing teams'  philosophy is to not call "fair catch=
." I=20
first noticed this against  Nebraska last year. And I certainly think that=
=20
making an early tackle by  invading the "halo" and receiving a 5-yard penal=
ty=20
is much better than  sitting back and possibly allowing a big return.
=09
=09But if we're going to  get the penalty, why not lay our ears back and po=
p the=20
receiver in the  mouth whether he's caught the ball or not? A big hit would=
=20
make that  penalty a little easier to swallow, don't you think?=20
=09?? Cody Anderson, Houston, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  No question about it. First, you want to try to avoid getting t=
he=20
penalty. But if you are going to get the penalty, then get your money's wor=
th=20
and give that returner something to remember for next time.=20
=09
=09I hate this rule. Colorado coach Gary Barnett went so far as to say that=
=20
against a team with great returners, such as Kansas State, who has David=20
Allen, it's better to violate the halo rule and tackle these guys, take the=
=20
5-yard penalty and keep them from breaking one 60 or 70 yards for a score.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: It seems like I've been waiting forever for the offensive line to cl=
ick.=20
Did something come together finally or have I not been paying attention? (I=
=20
am out of state and am limited to TV and had to miss one game.)=20
=09?? Jerry Secrets=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  No, things did click in the second half of the Oklahoma State g=
ame.=20
The running game used a gap-blocking scheme that focuses more on blocking=
=20
angles than individual players. On running plays, the guard opposite the pl=
ay=20
side was pulling and creating some room for cutbacks. Mack Brown said the=
=20
team had used the gap scheme in the past and it just didn't work. But last=
=20
Saturday, it did.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Will Sean Rogers play on Saturday?=20
=09?? Rick Bush, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think it's doubtful. Rogers didn't practice Tuesday and was s=
till=20
seen with his walking boot on to protect his sprained ankle. But I'm sure h=
e=20
and the coaches will evaluate his status right up until game time. Those hi=
gh=20
ankle sprains can be a nightmare if they don't heal properly, however. No o=
ne=20
wants to rush him back and then lose him for the season because his return=
=20
was premature.=20

=09Josh Heupel =20
=09
=09Q: OU has a great passing attack. Do you feel that Texas' young secondar=
y can=20
answer the call? =20
=09 ?? Marty Wagner=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  This is the battle of the game, in my opinion: OU's receivers v=
s.=20
UT's secondary. If OU quarterback Josh Heupel goes unpressured, the UT=20
secondary might need therapy after this game. But Rod =20
=09
=09Babers and Quentin Jammer have made progress each game. If Lee Jackson i=
s=20
back, he'll play strong safety, and Greg Brown would move from SS back to=
=20
free safety. That means Dakarai Pearson goes back to the nickel back, which=
=20
in this game, is good news for UT. You need Pearson in the game as much as=
=20
possible. In my opinion, he breaks on the ball better than most of UT's=20
D-backs.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: How do you see the Texas-Oklahoma game shaping up? What will be the =
keys?=20
=09?? Sara Wilson=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think the offenses are equal, so it will come down to who pla=
ys=20
the best defense. I think Texas has the better defense, even without Shaun=
=20
Rogers. So I see Texas winning, 24-20. Turnovers will change the complexion=
=20
of the game, of course. But I think UT is catching OU at the right time aft=
er=20
picking up some much-needed confidence on offense against Oklahoma State.=
=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Now that the quarterback experiment SHOULD be officially over at Tex=
as,=20
do you expect Major Applewhite to start and play the entire game against OU=
?=20
Also (looking ahead to next year because this year it is no longer an issue=
),=20
do you think Major Applewhite would be a legitimate Heisman Trophy candidat=
e=20
IF he were to start every game and take 90 percent of the snaps?=20
=09
=09My two cents ... I think the Texas coaches better start treating Major=
=20
Applewhite like one of the best college quarterbacks in the country, which =
he=20
obviously is, and start treating Chris Simms like the second-best quarterba=
ck=20
at the University of Texas, which he might be. (I say might because I haven=
't=20
seen Chance Mock play in a game. He might be better than Simms.)=20
=09 ?? Clint Mickey=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Major Applewhite will start against Oklahoma (based on repetiti=
ons=20
with the first team in practice this week) and I would be shocked if he=20
doesn't play most or all of this game. In fact, I think Major will play mos=
t=20
or all of the next two games.=20
=09
=09If UT beats OU, the Colorado game will be one of those nightmare games=
=20
because UT will be fighting a letdown and the Buffaloes will probably still=
=20
be winless (the Bufs play at A=02?this week).  So, these next two games are=
 all=20
about experience. But I think Simms will be back in action when UT takes on=
=20
Missouri on Oct. 21 because the coaches are sticking with the notion of=20
having two starting quarterbacks.=20
=09
=09I think Applewhite would be a Heisman Trophy candidate this season if he=
 had=20
been the lone starter. It's just impossible to think of yourself as the bes=
t=20
player in the nation, I would think, when your coaches don't think you're t=
he=20
best QB on your own team.=20
=09
=09As far as next year, you would have to think the coaches are going to=20
continue this rotation because they have not backed off of it much this=20
season. We'll see. Mock is still two years away unless Applewhite or Simms=
=20
gets injured.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09
=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Major Applewhite =20
=09
=09Q: It's become obvious to everyone outside MackWorld that Major Applewhi=
te=20
has established himself as the one and only starting quarterback at Texas. =
It=20
has become ridiculous to call both quarterbacks "starters" and insist on=20
token starts for Chris Simms.=20
=09
=09It seems to me it would be less demeaning to Simms to name Applewhite as=
 THE=20
starter and bring Simms in for quality playing time during the game instead=
=20
of allowing him two series, then yanking him in favor of the REAL starter w=
ho=20
then plays the rest of the game. The current charade hasn't fooled anyone. =
As=20
fine as Simms' =20
=09
=09talent appears to be, this is Major's team.  Any comments? =20
=09?? Rowell Rogers, Denton=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I talked to Major one-on-one on Monday, and he said he didn't=
=20
realize how much confidence he had lost this season until he got the infusi=
on=20
of confidence by leading Texas on five straight scoring drives of the secon=
d=20
half against Oklahoma State. If the coaches are insistent about this=20
rotation, it will be interesting to see if Applewhite can continue to=20
maintain or build on the confidence he seized in the OSU game. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is happening with special teams? I know they have had some rece=
nt=20
success after missed tackles and have improved, but what I cannot understan=
d=20
is why the opposing team can get so close to Kris Stockton and UT, with=20
superior recruiting and athletes, can not even get close. This has really=
=20
hurt us. How is our blocking so different? Why does this problem persist? =
=20
=09?? Chad Dieterichs=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It sure appears to me that the players on the line are giving w=
ay=20
too much ground after the snap. Almost every punt this season has been a=20
matter of, can Stockton get the punt off before the opposing team collapses=
=20
onto Stockton's pocket?=20
=09
=09Mack Brown gets very upset with questions about the punt team. He says t=
hat=20
they use the same formation that every NFL team uses and that special teams=
=20
are prone to breakdowns because there aren't enough scholarships to recruit=
=20
special teams players. And he says young players have to be used because=20
veterans get tired playing offense and defense.=20
=09
=09I asked Mack if he thought that members of the punt team were starting t=
o=20
have a mental block, now that two punts have been blocked this season. He=
=20
said he didn't know. He said the latest punt block against Oklahoma State w=
as=20
the result of OSU players twisting and a UT player failing to pick up the=
=20
assignment. At least this time, the punt blocker didn't run untouched throu=
gh=20
the middle of the line.=20
=09?
=09
=09 Q: I think people get too caught up in what's happening right now to re=
alize=20
what this team will be in a year or two. All we've heard about is how=20
wonderful Mack's recruiting has been and how loaded we are, yet how the=20
O-line is less than impressive and how the QB situation is hurting us.=20
=09
=09Guess what? Most of these "great" players are only 18. Remember Ricky as=
 a=20
freshman? Didn't think so. Think about how solid we will be in two years wi=
th=20
current players and the new recruits coming in. So if we lose another game =
or=20
two this season and end up in the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl, no=
=20
biggie.=20
=09
=09In a year or two, we'll be right in there. So here's my question. What w=
ill=20
it take for Texas to be consistently rated up there with the great college=
=20
programs? Right now, as a friend of mine would say, we have a good team and=
=20
we're building a good program. It seems that Texas is heading in that=20
direction, but we have a little way yet to go. What does Texas need to be a=
=20
true Top 10 team? Is it personnel-based or is it about chemistry? =20
=09?? Alex Kephart, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think it has to do with chemistry and experience at this poin=
t.=20
The talent is there. Mack Brown is recruiting winners. But each of the line=
s=20
has to have experience, and there have to be some "Braveheart"-type leaders=
=20
on the team.=20
=09
=09Right now, the offensive line is still growing, even though it has two=
=20
seniors. The defensive line has great senior tackles, but the ends are raw.=
=20
So the defensive line probably won't be great again after this year for a=
=20
couple years, if you believe that you need senior lines to win a national=
=20
championship.=20
=09
=09But I agree with you. Texas has all the makings of being a powerhouse in=
stead=20
of just a good team in the next two to three years. Everyone will put the=
=20
Longhorns back up in the Top 5 next year because of their schedule. But Tex=
as=20
will be a veteran team with great depth in the next two to three years.=20
=09
=09Right now, Texas and its fans and even the media have been guilty (me=20
included) of holding Texas to the same standard as Nebaraska and Florida=20
State. But that's probably not fair just yet. The stud players Brown is=20
recruiting need time to settle into the system and get some experience. In=
=20
the next couple years, Texas will justifiably be held to the same standard =
as=20
the perennial powers.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: : I have two questions for you Chip: A) Does The University still ha=
ve=20
the longest scoring streak in NCAA football? B) If I find myself looking at=
=20
NEXT year's schedule after a payback loss at Stanford, do I need profession=
al=20
help? (P.S. You may also want to remind your readers we should NEVER feel=
=20
guilty about running up the score against U of H.)=20
=09?? Arland Bishop=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Texas has scored in a Big 12-record 231 straight games, dating =
back=20
to a 16-0 loss at Baylor in 1980. That is the second-longest active streak =
in=20
the nation. BYU holds the longest scoring streak: 318 games.=20
=09
=09Next year's schedule is even more appetizing than this year's schedule. =
The=20
only non-conference road game is at Houston. The non-conference home games=
=20
are New Mexico State and North Carolina. And the Big 12 schedule has Colora=
do=20
in Austin. UT will have Oklahoma in Dallas (as usual) and Texas A=02?at Kyl=
e=20
Field.=20
=09
=09So, no, you don't need therapy. If anything, next year's schedule should=
 be=20
another reason to have patience with this year's team. Good times are=20
obviously on the horizon.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I know the subject has been worn into the ground, but I haven't hear=
d=20
this view from anyone so ... In the mid-'90s Florida State was struggling=
=20
early in the season with a young, talented QB named Charlie Ward (of course=
).=20
They were winning the early games against less-talented teams, but just=20
barely. Then, they finally put Ward in the shotgun on virtually every down=
=20
and let him do his magic.=20
=09
=09It was like night and day.  Basically, what they did was abandon their m=
ore=20
balanced attack and did what their talent dictated they could do - pass ear=
ly=20
and often. The run was still used, but it was more to complement the pass.=
=20
=09
=09I know UT is not in the exact situation, but this may make sense for the=
m.=20
The only time I thought the UT offense looked really good this year was rig=
ht=20
when Major Applewhite first came in against Louisiana-Lafayette and drove=
=20
straight down the field. And, Major took almost every snap in the shotgun (=
at=20
least the first drive). I know it was against an inferior opponent that was=
=20
probably taken by surprise, but they showed more on those drives with Major=
=20
in the first and second quarter than they have the rest of the season (so=
=20
far).=20
=09
=09I believe you CAN win in college football with an unbalanced attack. FSU=
 has=20
done it with primarily passing, and I can't begin to name all the OU and=20
Nebraska-type teams that have won conference/national titles with=20
one-dimensional offenses. Also, the shotgun helps Major's biggest liability=
 -=20
his mobility. Personally, I don't care which QB is used this season - in th=
e=20
shotgun or not, but I really wish Mack Brown would just choose one and stic=
k=20
with him. =20
=09?? Aaron Ruhnow=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think you will continue to see the shotgun used only in speci=
fic=20
situations. The Texas coaches are too committed to being a balanced offense=
=20
that can run out of multiple sets. I do like the shotgun. The Buffalo Bills=
=20
used it all the time while they were going to all those Super Bowls. You ca=
n=20
do a lot with it. But it probably won't become a fixture in Austin.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Do you think that the pressure and expectations of Texas fans are go=
ing=20
to be too much for Mack Brown to handle? It appears he is already crumbling=
.=20
If he thinks people are hammering him now, what will it be like if he drops=
=20
this year's game to A=02?and suffers four losses?=20
=09?? Mike McDonald=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  : I hope it won't be too much for Mack Brown. He's a good perso=
n and=20
works really hard. I think he needs to just let some of this stuff wash ove=
r=20
him and forget about it. I think he has gotten into a rut lately where he=
=20
senses that every question has negative overtones. So now he is answering=
=20
every question by acknowledging his critics with some kind of remark.=20
=09
=09He has done more for Texas than UT will ever know. He has reshaped the=
=20
mindset of the university with the positive outlook he has brought to the=
=20
football team. Games are selling out. Players are coming to Austin. The kid=
s,=20
for the most part, are good kids.=20
=09
=09There's no need for Mack to draw a line in the sand and allow a few nega=
tive=20
voices to bring him down or cast a shadow over all the progress he has made=
.=20
If he moves on, the media and the critics will move on, too. If he harps on=
=20
criticism and keeps bringing it up in his answers, the media has no=20
alternative but to report it. It becomes a wicked circle.=20
=09?

=09
=09
=09 Q: Is it just me , or does the football field look a little bit torn up=
? It=20
just looks really dry and during the game a lot of turf gets thrown up.=20
=09?? Mark V.=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  UT officials say it's the drought and the fact that the UT team=
=20
practices on the field on Thursdays. But, I agree. I think the field looks=
=20
worse this season than it did last season (and we had a drought and the tea=
m=20
practiced on it last year, too).=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is up with all the negative press that Mack Brown and the Horns=
 have=20
been getting lately? From exercising their right to buy out of the Hawaii=
=20
game to losing their chance at a national title to running up the score in=
=20
the U of H game, and finally, to wanting the U of H game moved from a high=
=20
school stadium to a real college stadium where real fans can see a football=
=20
game.
=09
=09I'm not sure about Dallas, but here in Houston Mack and Co. have been ge=
tting=20
drilled for everything I listed above and more (QB rotation). It just seems=
=20
like everyone in the media, and even some our own fans, want to find=20
something negative to heap on the program.
=09
=09In my opinion, Mack and the rest of the team do not deserve this. Mack, =
his=20
coaches and the players have been nothing short of genuine and up-front wit=
h=20
the media and the public. They have expressed confidence, but never boasted=
=20
about their greatness. In fact, they have been the epitome of humility. Do=
=20
you have any thoughts as to why this is occurring? Hook 'em. =20
=09?? Marty Murray, Class of '82, Baytown, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  It does seem to be a ridiculous truth that when we build someth=
ing=20
up, we inevitably end up tearing it down. Maybe the sense is that the=20
storybook season of 1998 and the victory over Nebraska last year built up t=
oo=20
big of expectations. The three losses at the end of last year did nothing t=
o=20
burst the bubble and then when UT comes out flat this year, everyone=20
re-evaluated and said, "Wait, they really aren't that good."
=09
=09Mack Brown had been telling people to reduce their expectations. But whe=
n the=20
star falls, people want to be the first to say it's falling. Then, they wan=
t=20
to add their own wrinkle as to why it's falling. So people look for cracks =
in=20
the foundation to bring up.=20
=09
=09It's like in political campaigns. The media tends to build up a candidat=
e and=20
then when the first negative story comes out, they re-evaluate, and if some=
=20
bad trends continue, that candidate gets torn to shreds. It all feeds on=20
itself. But inevitably there is a settling period.
=09
=09I think the people who are quick to say that Texas isn't as good as we=
=20
believed will calm down and there will be another story to cover. Plus, Tex=
as=20
may get hot, win all of its games, and then this brief bout of criticism wi=
ll=20
have been for naught. But sometimes criticism can be good for a coach and h=
is=20
team. He can use it as bulletin board material to get the team going. We'll=
=20
see how Mack Brown and the vocal minority of critics handle things from=20
here. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Do you think Chris Simms would have benefited from a redshirt year? =
I=20
realize we were thin at quarterback last year and it was probably not an=20
option, but I look back at Major Applewhite and it appears to me he benefit=
ed=20
from a redshirt year in which his only responsibility was to learn the=20
system. When he came in as a redshirt freshman, he was ready to go. Thanks=
=20
for your insightful newsletter. =20
=09?? Michael R. Johnson, Houston, Texas =20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Sure, I think most players benefit from a redshirt year unless =
they=20
are Michael Vick. There was no way a redshirt season was going to happen fo=
r=20
Simms, however. Simms wants to spend just four years in college, and UT=20
coaches needed a backup for Applewhite. There is no question Applewhite=20
benefited from his redshirt season.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I'm really sick of all this negative stuff from a vocal minority of=
=20
fair-weather fans. They sound like a bunch of whining Aggies.=20
=09
=09Having said that, I still can't help but wonder if we don't have a probl=
em=20
with our offensive line coach. According to the UT media guide, Coach Tim=
=20
Nunez has had very little experience as an offensive line coach prior to=20
coming here. He didn't play that position either. There is no track record =
of=20
having actually developed a line, since he inherited experienced lines at=
=20
both Marshall and UT.=20
=09
=09This group clearly hasn't improved, even though it was a major source of=
=20
concern after last season. Nunez may be a fine coach and a great recruiter,=
=20
but does anyone think that he is one of the top O-line coaches in the=20
country? Is he the one who we want developing the fine group of incoming li=
ne=20
recruits we have committed for next year?=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Patience. Don't fire a coach before it gets to mid-season. If t=
he=20
offensive line doesn't show any progress by the end of the year, then it's=
=20
time to talk about whether coaches have done their jobs. Nunez was coaching=
=20
this line when it beat Nebraska last year, so let's give him some time to=
=20
work with these guys.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What's the scoop on playing UH at Robertson Stadium next year? Can T=
exas=20
(a la Hawaii) threaten to cancel the game with Houston unless it is played =
in=20
the Astrodome or Rice Stadium? Also, how can either school afford to give u=

=20
they do put in an extra 10,000 temporary seats?=20
=09?? Chris Barbee, El Campo, Texas =20

=09 BROWN:  This is a price Texas will pay for trying to rekindle some semb=
lance=20
of an old Southwest Conference matchup. After UT canceled the Hawaii game, =
I=20
doubt they will actively seek to change next year's schedule. It will be an=
=20
intimate setting, shall we say.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I live in Odessa and I use to see Roy Williams do punt returns. Why =
not=20
let  him return some punts?=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown doesn't like to put freshmen back on punt returns un=
til=20
at least mid-season. After mid-season, he argues that freshmen aren't=20
freshmen anymore. So, perhaps after mid-season, if UT is not making any=20
progress on punt returns, we'll see some new faces back there. I would love=
=20
to see what Williams can do, although I doubt that coaches would put him ba=
ck=20
there. And I would really like to see Nathan Vasher back there. Heck, I wou=
ld=20
like to see Nathan Vasher everywhere. From what I have seen, the kid is=20
fearless with tons of confidence. We'll see.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Before the UT/Oklahoma State game, I thought that Mack Brown would s=
tart=20
shuffling the quarterbacks less often - giving them a quarter or two instea=
d=20
of two or three series each - in order to begin to establish some sort of=
=20
consistency. (In your Sept. 25 column, you also said this should happen.) I=
n=20
the game, Chris Simms started, but was pulled early after an interception,=
=20
and Applewhite played until well into the fourth quarter. The TV announcers=
=20
even wondered aloud if Simms was hurt in some way, since he didn't get back=
 =20
in until late in the game.=20
=09
=09My question is: Was this a message to Simms in some way, due to his poor=
=20
early performance? Or was this somewhat scripted in advance in order to giv=
e=20
Applewhite the reigns? It certainly appears that the coaches have more=20
confidence in Applewhite based on the situations they put him in. =20
=09?? Rick Highfill. Naperville, Ill.=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I sincerely think that the coaches have been trying to give Sim=
ms=20
every chance to thrive and possibly win the job. After four games, it's cle=
ar=20
he hasn't won the job outright. Now, coaches have to decide if this rotatio=
n=20
is really the best thing for the team and its leadership. I think they will=
=20
rely more on Applewhite in the next two games and thus kind of disprove the=
ir=20
own theories about having two starters.=20
=09
=09The hard part about the public relations in this situation is that once =
you=20
say you have two starters, it's a real blow to one once you say that you no=
w=20
only have one starter. I think the coaches will continue to say they have t=
wo=20
starters and play Simms out of fear of an injury affecting Applewhite. I=20
don't know if that's the right answer. Applewhite grew on the job without a=
ny=20
game training before Richard Walton went down in 1998. So who knows?=20
=09
=09I would think the coaches will again rotate after the OU and Colorado ga=
mes=20
because they will face teams (Missouri, Baylor, Texas Tech and Kansas) that=
=20
they will probably be favored to beat. At that point, if you're UT, you jus=

hope that the rotation doesn't hurt the team's offensive progress heading=

I have not verified your math but "championships" prior to the associated 
press do not count b/c there was no governing authority that conferred 
national titles before the AP ( as you will notice the retroactive 
declaration of national champions prior to the early 1930's).

Speaking of SEC dominance, Brian and I made a 100 dollar bet this weekend.  
Who had more football titles, the teams in the SEC or the teams in the Big 
12????

Well, after analyzing the data for the past hour, and analyzing every poll 
every which way, there is no doubt about it now.  I counted each single poll 
individually (AP, the National Football Foundation and College Football Hall 
of Fame, the United Press, the Football Writers Polls and the USA Today/ESPN) 
and every poll gives more championships to the Big 12 than the SEC.

Since college football is all about rivalries and drinking, Eric and I will 
be hosting a "The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12 happy hour" which 
will be paid for by Brian "The SEC is definitely better than the BIG 12" 
Hoskins.

Hey Allison,

Not much is going on over here, just gutting it out until the weekend.  It

solid blue is the outermost track - dashe blue is the internal projection for 
its path
so, i have nothing to worry about, womanJust a reminder.  Please try to be at the field by 6:30.$0 for centersWhat did you think of the debate?  I thought, all in all, Bush did a good job 
- mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool 
of himself.  Gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage.  Do you think 
that the American public notices that the only issue he makes is with Bush's 
tax cuts going to the "wealthiest one percent".   That is the biggest load of 
garbage I have ever heard-   I know Bush can't say this but, if you do the 
math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to 
the rest of the country.  So, if there is an across the board tax cut, 
obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back.

I received an invitation in the mail to purchase Rockets tickets online 2 
days earlier than they go on sale to the general public.  The opener is Tues 
10/31 at 7:30 PM vs. the T-Wolves.    I know how much you guys like sitting 
in the cheap seats, so you can listen to comments such as "I'm gonna let you 
hear it-AIRBALL!," and "He just made Sportscenter."  If you want to go to the 
game let me know  and I will buy the tickets this week.

I think that despite all of the ballyhoo about Simms ( and I know you hate 
this), Applewhite should play.  I think if Applewhite plays and we have a 
decent running game, we can blow them out.  Our defense is good enough to 
shut pretty much anyone down.

When are you going up and what are ya'll doing up there?

Hi everyone,

I will be *walking to cure diabetes* on November 5th, and was hoping each of 
you could donate on my behalf.  As is written below, 84% of all donations to 
JDF go directly to diabetes research.  Wouldn't you feel good about giving to 
such an efficient organization and honorable cause?  I'm sure you all need a 
tax write-off too, right? :)  You can use a copy of your canceled check for 
tax purposes.  

Also, if you donate $25 or more, you will get an Enron JDF T-shirt.  Of 
course, donations of any amount will be greatly appreciated.  Feel free to 
forward this message to others who might be interested in donating, as well.

I will be making the rounds next week to get a head start on collecting, so 
please email me if you'd like to contribute and bring a check made payable to 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.

Thanks in advance for your participation!

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

A salesman from New Jersey pulled off the highway to get gas in Tyler, TX
recently and wandered into town to soak up the local culture. He noticed a
'Nativity Scene' that showed great skill and talent had gone into creating
it. One small feature bothered him however. The 3 wisemen were wearing
firemens helmets. Totally unable to come up with a reason or explanation,
he left. However, when he stopped at the E-Z Mart to get gas, he ask the lady
behind the counter about the helmets. She exploded into a rage, yelling,
"You Yankees never do read the Bible!" He assured her that he did, but simply
couldn't recall anything about firemen in the Bible. She jerked her Bible
from behind the counter and ruffled thru some pages, and finally jabbed
her finger at a passage. Sticking it in his face she said See, it says right
here, "The three wise men came from afar."

=09
=09Q: Last year, the coaches raved about Ivan Williams and almost took off =
his=20
redshirt. Now, a year later, he hasn't gotten a sniff at real playing time =
at=20
tailback. What happened to tailback by committee? It seems like we could us=
e=20
a bigger back (given the lack of blocking prowess by the O-line).=20
=09?? Bob Nance=20
=09
=09
=09
=09 BROWN:  Good question. The coaches took a good look at everyone in the=
=20
Houston game. They came away thinking that Kenny Hayter needs some more=20
carries. They still think that Ivan Williams is developing the toughness=20
needed to run in college. In the Louisiana-Lafayette game, coaches thought =
he=20
was running tentatively.=20
=09
=09Just as an aside, Hodges Mitchell says the running game is going to cut =
loose=20
this week. He says this season has been just like last season. For three=20
games, the running game has been Nikes stuck in glue. But he says this week=
=20
is the week. If it is, there would be no better confidence-builder than to =
do=20
it against the nation's top rushing defense. OSU is giving up just 30.3 yar=
ds=20
per game rushing this season. (Texas is fourth nationally against the run,=
=20
yielding 47.0 ypg). I think it will be tough sledding for the UT RBs this=
=20
week. Should be a good passing game, though.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Many of us who discuss this frequently still question the play-calli=
ng on=20
offense, and feel that Texas can never win a national championship with Gre=
g=20
Davis as offensive coordinator. Any comments?=20
=09?? Reggie Reeves=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Davis is not the problem. His offenses routinely rate among the=
=20
nation's best in either rushing, passing or total offense. This season, UT =
is=20
fourth nationally in pass offense (366.5 yards per game). The running game=
=20
stinks. But he has gotten the passing game to the top with a quarterback=20
rotation that appears to have kept both Major Applewhite and Chris Simms fr=
om=20
peaking and with receivers who are barely old enough to shave.=20
=09
=09Davis is in constant contact with Gary Kubiak of the Denver Broncos. The=
=20
Broncos are considered one of the most cutting-edge offenses in the NFL.=20
Davis is constantly tapping into Kubiak and trying to bring in new wrinkles=
=20
to the UT offense. I don't know if anyone works harder than he does. Plus,=
=20
the quarterbacks love him. Even if they don't love this rotation, they love=
=20
him. I have seen no signs that this rotation has eroded that relationship.
=09
=09Davis is solid. In fact, if there is a UT coach who could leave the staf=
f in=20
the near future for a head job or head coordinator job in the NFL, it's Gre=
g=20
Davis.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: In your first newsletter I asked you why is everyone so excited abou=
t=20
this year's team when they showed last year that they could not run the=20
football. Against the big boys, you better have more balance. You replied=
=20
that the line is one year older and should be better. No, Chip, sorry, but=
=20
they are less than a year older since they struggled at the end of the seas=
on=20
with running and picking up blitzes. Now, not to say I told you so, but it =
is=20
still a serious problem that you sports writers overlooked and got too caug=
ht=20
up in the QB hype and the great receiving corps. Shame on you.=20
=09
=09Maybe that offensive line is not as great as you guys thought? I see UT =
going=20
8-3 this year and hanging around at 15th, which is where they should be. Th=
ey=20
are still young and not hungry enough as evidenced by poor starts against=
=20
really bad teams. Horn fans and sportswriters need to be a bit more patient=
=20
this year and take off their blinders. Maybe being a sportswriter during my=
=20
days at UT helped me see through the hype. Hook'em! =20
=09?? Larry, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I thought this offensive line would be much better than it's sh=
own=20
this season, but I wouldn't give up on them. Everyone saw UT's third=20
possession against Houston in which Leonard Davis and Derrick Dockery - two=
=20
guys I think have to take leadership roles on that line - allowed a DE to g=
o=20
untouched right between them and stuff the running back for a 6-yard loss.=
=20
=09
=09This kind of play should be a deep concern for UT coaches. Dockery has b=
een=20
sick, and is still trying to regain weight lost while out with an infected=
=20
cyst. Davis has struggled to get chemistry with Dockery's backup, Tillman=
=20
Holloway. Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says the line tends to play bett=
er=20
in the second half than it does in the first half because it takes a while=
=20
for them to get on the same page and see what the defense is doing. That,=
=20
however, may be too late against a good team.=20
=09
=09The old adage goes that you have to have a senior-laden offensive line t=
o=20
have any real chance at a national title or Top 10 success. So far, that=20
appears to be true. Texas' O-line has just two seniors (Leonard Davis, Cory=
=20
Quye), two juniors (Antwan Kirk-Hughes, Matt Anderson) and a sophomore=20
(Derrick Dockery). =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: How frustrated is Chris Simms with his lack of playing time? In the=
=20
off-season I kept hearing about how most of the players were really impress=
ed=20
with the passing abilities of Simms. Are any of the players now questioning=
=20
why Chris is not playing more than he is?=20
=09?? Jeff Weaver, Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Simms said this week that the rotation is difficult. But player=
s=20
have not chosen sides. Simms says there are times when he makes a mistake a=
nd=20
would love to go back in and correct it, even though his rotation is up and=
=20
Major Applewhite is coming in. The questions for both guys are constant.=20
=09
=09Simms also said there are times when he knows it's his last series befor=
e=20
Applewhite comes in, and it's third-and-17 and he's tempted to throw a deep=
=20
pass to try to make something happen and stay in the game. Against Houston,=
=20
he had a situation like that and opted to throw a 6-yard route to B.J.=20
Johnson, the safer choice. "It was the smarter thing to do," he said.=20
=09
=09My theory was that the coaches would try to get Simms as much playing ti=
me as=20
possible in the first four games to show what he can do. And then, come=20
Oklahoma, the coaches settle on one QB. After the OSU game, I think the=20
coaches need to settle on one guy for awhile and give credence to the=20
hot-hand policy Brown said he would employ this season. The question is, wi=
ll=20
Simms get enough snaps to show he deserves to be that guy? Right now, coach=
es=20
have tended to lean on Applewhite whenever it's crunch time.=20

=09[IMAGE]=20
=09Major Applewhite =20
=09
=09Q: Major Applewhite has become the red-headed straight-A student who is=
=20
having to contend with the jock favored son. Mack Brown has to appease alum=
s=20
and parents (Simms') who want to see Phil Simms' son as UT's QB. I think wh=
at=20
is being done is a ... (I have to say  it) ... a Major Injustice.=20
=09 ?? A "Major" Longhorn fan from Dallas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I think there is a misconception out there that Phil Simms is=
=20
constantly calling Mack Brown, demanding that he give Chris more playing=20
time. Or that Mack Brown made some deal with the Simms family, assuring=20
everyone that Chris would get playing time. None of that is true.=20
=09
=09According to Chris, the only assurance he received is that he would be=
=20
allowed to =20
=09
=09compete  for the starting job. So far, that's what's happened. Now, whet=
her=20
Chris continues to make the most of his playing time and shows that he=20
deserves to get substantial minutes remains to be seen.=20
=09
=09It's hard to argue with Applewhite's results so far this season. Here's =
a=20
breakdown of their stats: Applewhite is 49 of 87 passing (56.3 percent=20
completion rate) for 729 yards with 6 TDs and 3 interceptions. He has a QB=
=20
rating of 142.57. Simms has completed 19 of 36 passes (52.8 percent) for 25=
7=20
yards with three TDs and three interceptions. His QB rating is 123.58. But=
=20
Brown is not trying to appease Simms as much as he is trying to see what=20
Simms can do.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Is the quarterback rotation hurting the UT offense?=20
=09?? Sara McFadden=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  I asked Major Applewhite if he was playing up to his ability th=
is=20
season. He said no. I asked him if Chris Simms was playing as well as he=20
could. Applewhite said no. If one or the other was given the QB job until h=
e=20
lost the hot hand, you wonder if there might be some more rhythm to this=20
offense. But it's almost impossible to know.=20
=09
=09The players say it doesn't matter who is playing QB, they're both solid.=
 It=20
is hard to argue that Major shouldn't be the man. All he's done is win and=
=20
break records. Simms is still adjusting to college ball and not being "the=
=20
man" for the first time in his competitive life. Every time he has walked=
=20
onto a football field, he's been Phil Simms' kid and the top choice to play=
=20
QB. Now, he's battling with a guy who has Major results.=20
=09
=09I thought that the rotation was hurting the offense. But offensive=20
coordinator Greg Davis justifiably pointed out to me that UT has passed for=
=20
more yards through three games this year than it did last year. So I decide=
d=20
to break everything down in the passing game, comparing UT's offense throug=
h=20
three games this year to the first three games of 1999. While Texas has mor=
e=20
passing yards (986 in 2000 to 940 in 1999) and more TD passes (9 in 2000 to=
 7=20
in 1999), the combined completion percentage of both QBs is down (55.3 in=
=20
2000 to 61.6 in 1999). UT also has more interceptions this year (6 in 2000 =
to=20
1 in 1999). And one of those picks was returned for a touchdown.=20
=09
=09I tend to think Applewhite's numbers would be much better if he were all=
owed=20
to start and stay in. Of course, Simms would have better numbers, too, if h=
e=20
got to play most of the game. But by sharing, I think both of their=20
production is down. Maybe it's just a matter of getting used to this=20
rotation. We'll see how long everyone can keep a positive attitude about=20
this. Davis said Tuesday he could see the team rotating both quarterbacks a=
ll=20
season long. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: What is the source of greater confusion for the O-line: opposing=20
defenses' tactics or Texas' own offensive scheme?  In other words, is the=
=20
offense too complex so that they don't know their assignments  or are they=
=20
simply being outplayed? =20
=09 ?? Rowell Rogers, Denton, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The offensive linemen, quarterbacks and coaches all say that th=
ey=20
have seen a slew of junk defenses through the first three games. Coach Mack=
=20
Brown said Louisiana-Lafayette, Stanford and Houston did not use defensive=
=20
schemes that they had shown in previous games.=20
=09
=09Brown's contention is that other teams can make their season by beating =
UT,=20
so they gamble and throw a bunch of risky blitzes at the Longhorns. Against=
=20
Stanford, UT wasn't good enough to make the Cardinal pay. So, according to =
UT=20
personnel, the defenses have been new. Now that it's the fourth game of the=
=20
season, one would think there are only so many defenses the O-line hasn't=
=20
seen. The excuses are running out.=20

you for your time.=20
=09?? James Taglienti=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Madden is someone I consider UT's secret weapon. He's much more=
 than=20
a coach for this team. He works their bodies and minds and can be credited=
=20
with getting this team to believe that it could beat Nebraska back in 1998.=
=20

=20
None of the breakdowns so far this season can be attributed to Madden.=20

=09 Q: Are there any hopes for a national championship considering the loss=
 to =20
Stanford?=20
=09?? Liddy Newsome=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Anything is possible. Texas would need Nebraska to remain=20
undefeated, and then hope the other top 10 teams pick up a loss or two. If=
=20
Texas could go unbeaten the rest of the way and beat an undefeated and No. =
1=20
Nebraska in the Big 12 title game, the Longhorns could possibly get lucky a=

end up in the Orange Bowl. But that is about as long a shot as Ricky Willia=

suiting up for UT this Saturday.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I have heard a lot about how much talent Chance Mock has. How does h=
is =20
talent compare to that of Chris Simms? If he wouldn't have redshirted, coul=
d=20
he have beat out Chris or possibly Major Applewhite as the main guy?=20
=09?? Brett Holmes=20
=09

much to learn and wants to step in after Simms and Applewhite move on.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I think Hodges Mitchell is a good kid, with a good pedigree ... and=
=20
there's the rub. Is Coach Brown too in love with this kid? Is he doing an o=
ld=20
friend a favor by keeping this kid in the game? He had a decent season last=
=20
year, especially coming out of the shadow of Ricky Williams, but I have see=
n=20
nothing this year that suggests anything close to that this season.=20
=09
=09I cannot blame the O-line and here is why: For a prototypical "scat-back=
,"=20
Hodges seems to run to traffic. There were several plays last week where a=
=20
quick step one way or the other would have gotten him to more open field.=
=20
Instead he would run right into the defense. Does he just not have the=20
"vision" required of a good running back? I cannot believe that he is that=
=20
much better than the other running backs on the roster. Are the rest that=
=20
bad? There has to be more to the story.=20
=09?? Roy Cassas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mitchell apparently needs to be pushed to the brink of losing h=
is=20
job to really find traction. Last year, he was on the verge of losing his j=
ob=20
to Victor Ike when he started to really cut loose on the way to 1,300 yards=
=20
rushing and 300 yards receiving. He says he is ready to cut loose, again (i=
n=20
the fourth game, just like last year).  The problem is, Texas is playing=20
Oklahoma State this week, who has the nation's No. 1 defense against the ru=
n.=20
Last year, Mitchell broke a couple draws on Oklahoma State and ran for 149=
=20
yards. We'll see if he can shake the slump he's in. Otherwise, look for Ike=
=20
and Kenny Hayter to start getting more of the load.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: In your most recent "Inside UT Football" you mentioned that stations=
 on=20
the UT football network are listed on the texassports.com Web site. I have=

another suggestion for people such as me who live in other parts of the=20

=09 BROWN:  Thanks for sharing, Bud. Hope this helps some other folks.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Why does Coach Mack Brown reject criticism with cynicism, yet accept=
=20
praise with zeal? To illustrate my point, Coach Brown became terse while=20
citing fans as "... being negative and openly critical ..." (i.e., four=20
losses in five games, 100 net yards rushing in five games, a probable QB=20
controversy and lest we not forget, yet another blocked punt). Conversely,=
=20
Coach Brown will devour praise with carnivorous delight! Coach Brown cites=
=20
the team's emotional psyche as "... being fragile," yet Coach Brown fueled=
=20
this euphoria in the players during spring drills and prior to the season.=
=20
=09
=09Is it not the coach's responsibility to provide stability to the team's=
=20
mental and emotional state? Is Coach Brown's tenure paralleling the turbule=
nt=20
and volatile path taken by rival coach Jackie Sherrill at Texas A=02?(no eg=
os in=20
that one!) during the 1980s? =20
=09?? David Newburn=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown says all of his responses to criticism are simply to=
 help=20
his players and protect them from getting unfairly ripped. Brown is very=20
sensitive to criticism. If someone criticizes the running game, he reminds=
=20
them that the passing game is rated No. 4 nationally. When someone question=
s=20
the quarterback rotation, he tells people to be positive instead of negativ=
e=20
and contends that the players are fine with it - only the media is not.  I=
=20
honestly think that Brown tries to see everything in such a positive light=
=20
that he becomes personally offended at criticism and negative thinking. He=
=20
forgets that people are deeply, deeply passionate about their team. That=20
people get mad, really mad, when their team loses a game it shouldn't. Or=
=20
worse, when the team plays really lousy in losing a game it shouldn't (see=
=20
Stanford).=20
=09
=09I think Brown also believes that because he is so forthcoming in public=
=20
appearances and with the media and has done so much to restore the traditio=
n=20
to UT, that he feels betrayed when fans or the press criticize parts of his=
=20
team. He wants fans to rally behind their team, no matter what, and be the=
=20
first to pick up the team when it's down. Not pile on.=20
=09
=09But people are going to get angry when his team gives up five sacks, get=
s 10=20
penalties and gives up another blocked punt for a TD. There is no question =
he=20
is still adjusting to the intense scrutiny that comes with being at Texas.=
=20
When his team loses a game it shouldn't and plays terribly in doing so, he=
=20
will always hear it from the fans and the press, whether his team is young =
or=20
not.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Why do you suppose the Longhorns are throwing so few really long pas=
ses=20
this year? It seems to me doing so would open up the running game like it w=
as=20
when Ricky Williams was playing.=20
=09?? Will Vernon=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  They need some more time. The young receivers need a little mor=
e=20
time to adjust. But I do think that with the athleticism of the young=20
receivers, you will see more short routes that turn into long gains. Once R=
oy=20
Williams, Sloan Thomas and B.J. Johnson develop some comfort in this offens=
e,=20
I think you'll see more long pass plays.=20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: I just have two questions that have been frustrating for me this yea=
r.=20
The first deals with punt returns. I can respect Coach Mack Brown wanting t=
o=20
have an experienced player returning punts in order to avoid mistakes, but=
=20
why bring in so much talent and speed if you aren't going to use it? Why do=
es=20
Hodges Mitchell continue to return punts?=20
=09
=09He is too much of a dance-around, east-west runner to be successful in t=
he=20
kicking game. I realize he averaged close to 10-yds a return Saturday, but=
=20
his average was more a product of Houston's poor field position. We need a=
=20
gamebreaker returning kicks. If you trust the freshmen to play significant=
=20
minutes, why not trust them with the return game?=20
=09
=09Secondly, why do we pull Casey Hampton on third-down passing situations?=
=20
Hampton is a load and usually gets double-teamed. Why would you pull your=
=20
All-American in a situation like that? In their nickel defense, shouldn't=
=20
they push Shaun Rogers outside and leave Hampton in the middle?=20
=09?? Jeff Wilson=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Brown trusts Mitchell not to get tight and muff a punt return i=
n=20
front of 80,000 people. That's not the greatest criteria, in my opinion. I=
=20
would like to see Nathan Vasher back there personally, just to see what he=
=20
can do. Vasher has been fearless in everything I've seen him do. Mitchell=
=20
hasn't shown breakaway moves yet. If we don't see it soon, it might be time=
=20
to give someone else a shot.=20
=09
=09They take Hampton out on nickel situations because they think that Shaun=
=20
Rogers is the better pass rusher from the tackle position. There has been n=
o=20
talk about moving Rogers to end in pass-rush situations. =20
=09?
=09
=09
=09 Q: Coach Mack Brown appeared to be auditioning for the head coach job a=
t the=20
University of Oklahoma in the last minutes of the Houston game. Apparently=
=20
unsatisfied with a 40-0 lead and two minutes to go, the Horns unloaded a lo=
ng=20
pass from the arm of Chris Simms who hadn't been able to do anything all=20
night. Just when everyone was ready to run the clock out,  Brown, or Simms=
=20
(whoever was in charge), elected to do whatever necessary to humiliate our=
=20
guests even more by rubbing their noses in it. I, for one, was not very pro=
ud=20
of being a Texas-ex for the last two minutes of that game. Texas football=
=20
traditions took a hard blow in that  Switzer-like move. Shame.=20
=09?? Jim Ball, Class of '57, Big Sandy, Texas=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  Mack Brown says he had Simms throwing late in the game to get=

against Stanford.=20
=09
=09The pass into the end zone to Sloan Thomas in the waning seconds was a=

checkoff that Chris Simms made. Mack Brown said he wished that Simms hadn't=

=09
=09There was a huge outpouring of criticism for having Simms pass the ball =

I received this email and wanted to share the photo.

Beautiful but sad.

This awsome picture was taken in the Bitterroot National Forest here in
Montana on August 6, 2000 by a fire behavior analyst from Fairbanks,
Alaska  by the name of John McColgan with a Digital camera.  Since he
was working  while he took the picture, he cannot sell or profit from it
so he  should  at  least be recognized as the photographer of this once
in a lifetime shot.

Ladies & Gentlemen,

The BCS may have screwed up the match ups but that won't stop the annual 
College Bowl Pool from taking place.  The attached spreadsheet contains the 
rules and a pick sheet.  For the veterans the rules are the same as last 
year.  The entry fee is $25.  Money and picks are due Monday December 18th.  
Feel free to forward this to anyone that may be interested in participating.  

Cris








yeah, try to be there on time - preferably 6:30 - b/c we only have eight 
people

your choice of anderson or watters   and  taylortouchy, touchy.  if you look at garner's stats he is very consistent (about 
15 pts. a game) - the game last week helped his cause but he has been good 
all year.
My best offer is Freeman, Garner, and Beasley for Anderson/Watters and Taylor.

Let me know

The third highest because of one Extraordinary week...  My "Shitty"
receivers have outscored Toomer, he blows this year, I have no need for
another blow hard receiver.  Jeff George has the same value as last week..
Johnson is injury prone and one game will not make up for the last 3.  He
will falter again.

alright, when you find out that mine is the best bid for an injury prone

can come back to me and maybe toomer and garner (the third highest scoring
back in the league) will still be there.

Do you still want Beasley for Gonzalez?Matt has a win and Harry a loss.  They tied but the win goes to the one with 
the most reserve points.

Plove is going to go to Dallas.  We are going to leave next Friday when he 
gets done (7ish) and go up for the game.  The game is at 11 in the morning, 
so we will come home directly after it.  Plove says he has a friend who has a

Do you want to go?

The City League has once again revised our schedule.  Hopefully, this will be 
the last time.  In case you're wondering why we play the Jay Ballers, the 
team we beat last week, three times during the season and the Raiders only 
once, don't ask me.  The Raiders, however, are a much better team, so that 
should work to our advantage.  

Have a good weekend,
Brian

Ok- since you finally asked-

It is this book entitled "The Story of a Lifetime- A Keepsake of Personal 
Memoirs".  

Here is the description that was given:

"Give this book to someone whose story you want to know . . . It invites the 
reader to share memories, facts, philosophies, beliefs, knowledge, and wisdom 
gained from a lifetime of experience.  Hundreds of questions encourage 
thoughtful reponses.  When complete, it's a priceless heirloom for future 
generations."

I thought it was a neat gift idea- so that your mom can share her thoughts 
with you, and you (your children, your children's children) would have them 
when (unfortunately) she is not around anymore.

I ordered one for my mom also.

Hopefully it will be as neat as it sounds.

Do you want to take Dad somewhere for his birthday?  Maybe Thursday night?

You can only pick up players for the upcoming sunday's game through the

=09Every year since 1983, Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four g=
ames=20
of the season. That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the pa=

17 years - usually before Texas-OU weekend. =20
=09
=09 Orangebloods spend winter, spring and summer discussing the impact of n=
ew=20

luncheon tickets. They dream big dreams, and then by October, the high hope=
s=20
have usually come crashing down.=20
=09
=09 Only three times since 1983 has Texas opened the season 3-0: 1984, 1985=
 and=20
1994. Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie (1984) or=
=20
losses (1985 and 1994). In each of those seasons, Texas ended up with four=
=20
losses. =20
=09
=09 In UT's two best seasons since 1983, a 10-2 campaign in 1990 and a 10-2=
-1=20
run in 1995, the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season,=
=20
respectively. Before Texas can dream about winning a national title, the=20
Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss.=20
=09
=09=20
=09
=09
=09Longhorn Q & A=20
=09 Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as well as the last three games of l=
ast=20
season) it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue. There =
is=20
also no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think th=
e=20
best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20
offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving=
=20
us. =20
=09
=09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b=
est=20
athletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience=
d=20
players, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the=
=20
ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta=
rt=20
Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and=
=20
play a one-back offensive set. Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a=
nd=20
Hodges Mitchell is not an I-back who is adept at following the fullback=20
through the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people=
=20
miss in the open field.=20
=09
=09I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter=
back.=20
Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and=
=20
probably does) possess all of the same skills. He just hasn't had the chanc=
e=20
to display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if=
=20
we are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season=20
slipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?=20
=09 ?? The Jackson residence=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out=
 -=20
change coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are telli=
ng=20
this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be to=
o=20
much change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to=
=20
this Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some=
=20
resolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all=
=20
the positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and=
=20
Notre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th=
en=20
lost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,=
=20
Oklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's=
=20
opponent, Houston.=20
=09
=09That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread =
was=20
that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=
=20
loss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv=
e=20
to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20
could go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha=
rd=20
team to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor=
ns=20
are not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to=
=20
his team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will b=
e=20
scrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There will be enough fire=20

t=20
changes will have to be made constructively and gradually.=20

=09
=09 BROWN:  As the QBs turn. This week, it appears Chris Simms will start=
=20
because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the=
=20
trend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'll=
=20
see how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic =
in=20
his play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a=20
miraculous victory. I'm sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see=
=20
what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20
=09
=09to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games. =20
=09
=09Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mac=
k=20
Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of=
=20
his experience and the fact that it was the team's first game on the road. =
He=20
said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms. It would seem to =

=09I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Caroli=

of coming back and giving us a chance to win. Sometimes youth doesn't look=

=09?? Dave Stastny, Austin=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catch=

What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts? I know=

to linebacker? If I remember correctly, he played LB in high school at Texa=

column, but I've seen some unflattering trends in Mack Brown's program and=
=20
wanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=
=20
However, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team "up" sometime=
s=20
and can't adjust the team's mood during a game.=20
=09
=09About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible =
for=20
the offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than on=
e,=20
I put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges=
=20
Mitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis=
=20
love Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of=
=20
those yards were "move=20
=09
=09 the chains" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground=
 and=20
protect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but=
=20
all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th=
e=20
run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20
=09
=09Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive=
=20
tackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t=
he=20
linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there=
=20
with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a=
=20
receiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.
=09
=09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim=

may have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up=

=09
=09 BROWN:  I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20
incredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday=
's=20
events. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat=
=20

=20
other part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still=20
learning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20
=09
=09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a=
nd=20
needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20
fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl=
y=20
isn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di=
d=20
beat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas A=02?once. If a trend develop=
s,=20
and Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question=

about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwe=
d=20
on straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of t=
he=20
team.=20
=09
=09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the=
=20
quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still=
=20
working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'=
s=20
no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are=
=20
the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the=
=20
line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20
Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.=
=20
=09
=09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it =
was=20
taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about=
=20
that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20
deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20
blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20
Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20
=09
=09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in=
=20
games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.=
=20
The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl=
=20
Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl=
e=20
who can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B=
ut=20
that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because=
=20
one player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed =
to=20
block a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play=
er=20
has been chewed out every which way.
=09
=09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow=
n,=20
who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa=
y=20
anything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still=

Subject: Flag Football Schedule (Again)

The City League has once again revised our schedule.  Hopefully, this will be 
the last time.  In case you're wondering why we play the Jay Ballers, the 
team we beat last week, three times during the season and the Raiders only 
once, don't ask me.  The Raiders, however, are a much better team, so that 
should work to our advantage.  

Have a good weekend,
Brian

Let me quote from another source how I feel about trading Taylor.

"Let me get this right: You've waited three weeks for Taylor to get
healthy,
perhaps costing you a win or two, and now you want to trade him? No. Even
if
you think Taylor's going to get hurt again this year (that's a fairly safe
assumption), this is not the time to trade him. Get him in the lineup this
week and keep him there for a couple of weeks. Then, once his value has
maxed out again, that's the time to consider trading him. By that point,
you'll be offered a whole lot more than Anderson and Dudley."

Now, this does not mean I am unwilling to trade or barter, but I will treat
Taylor as the top 5 running back that he is and I will value him as such.
If that is an arena you want to trade in let me know and I will see what we
might be able to do.

Redskins to stick with Johnson at quarterback 
 Sept. 19, 2000
By Len Pasquarelli
SportsLine.com Senior Writer
 



Despite the continuing struggles of the offense and costly fourth-quarter 
interceptions by Brad Johnson, the Washington Redskins will stick with their 
starting quarterback for Sunday night's game against the New York Giants, 
SportsLine.com has confirmed. 

"If it was just (a problem) with Brad, then we'd look at it, but that's not 
the case," coach Norv Turner said. "But it goes beyond just the quarterback 
position. It's more than that. We're not playing well on offense in general." 

   
Redskins quarterback Brad Johnson will remain the team's starter against the 
unbeaten Giants.(AP)   

In the wake of the Redskins' 27-21 loss to the Dallas Cowboys on Monday 
night, there were rumblings Washington might switch to backup Jeff George for 
the key matchup against the undefeated Giants. The Washington offense, one of 
the league's most diverse in 1999 when it ranked No. 2 overall and second in 
scoring, has been sporadic at best in three games. 

A seventh-year veteran who is in the final season of his contract, Johnson 
has five interceptions the last two games, including four in the fourth 
quarters of those losses. He has not been sharp in either his play-calling or 
his execution, and even some teammates suggested privately Monday night that 
it might be time for a change. 

One glaring shortcoming has been the inability of the Washington offense to 
throw the deep ball and stretch opposition secondaries. The Redskins have 
only three completions this year of more than 20 yards, and the longest is 26 
yards. In Monday's defeat, the team's longest play was a 17-yard dumpoff to 
tailback Stephen Davis. 

The Redskins, who averaged 12.7 yards per completion in 1999 with both 
starting wide receivers averaging 18-plus yards, are averaging an anemic 9.2 
yards per catch this season. 

But Turner, who sources said was reluctant to make a quarterback change at 
this point and retains confidence in Johnson, acknowledged the team needs new 
focus more than a new starter. 

"There hasn't been any thought to switching (quarterbacks)," he said. "Right 
now, we need to get better at every position, quarterback and everywhere 
else."

Jeff George , QB WAS - The Snake Pit Updated 09/19/00
Sepculation is increasing that George may get a chance to start after Brad
Johnson struggled against Dallas. The rifle-armed QB may put a jolt into the
Washington offense if he indeed gets a chance to start.

Please forward to the owner of Brad Johnson.

I don't know what he is going to do.  I hope that they start Simms, not 
because Applewhite is bad but because Simms needs some time to develop.  
Although, I think that Mack is going to stay with his 2 QB system because of 
pride.

I do have to say, our QB question has definitely been answered.  I just hope 
our defense can hold up.  The Tech and Colorado games should be good guides.

THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER

  CLASSIC  VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house
  and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks  the ant is a
  fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant
  is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out
  in the cold.


  MODERN VERSION:

  The ant works hard in the withering  heat all summer long, building his
  house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks
  he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter,
  the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why
  the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while  others are cold and
  starving. CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of  the shivering
  grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home  with a table
  filled with food.

  "America" is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a
  country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?

  Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah  with the grasshopper, and everybody cries
  when they sing "It's Not Easy Being  Green."

  Bill and Hillary Clinton make a special guest appearance on the CBS Evening
  News to tell a concerned Dan Rather that they will do everything they
  can for the grasshopper who has been denied the prosperity he deserves by
  those who benefited unfairly during the Reagan summers, or as Bill refers to
  it as "Temperatures of the 80's"

  Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in  front of the ant's house where the
  news stations film the group singing "We shall overcome." Jesse then has the
  group kneel down to pray to God for  the grasshopper's sake.

  Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten
  rich off the back of the grasshopper, and calls  for an immediate tax hike
  on the ant to make him pay his "fair share."

  Finally, the EEOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act,"

  retroactive to the beginning of the summer. The ant is  fined for failing to
  hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having  nothing left to
  pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by  the government.

  Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation
  suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a  panel of federal
  judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients
  who can only hear cases on Thursday's between 1:30 and 3:00 PM when
  there are no talk shows scheduled.

  The ant loses the case. The story  ends as we see the grasshopper finishing
  up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he is
  in,which just happens to be the ant's old  house, crumbles around him since
  he doesn't maintain it.

  The ant has  disappeared in the snow. And on the TV, which the grasshopper
  bought by selling  most of the ant's food, they are showing Bill Clinton
  standing before a wildly  applauding group of Democrats announcing that a
  new era of "fairness" has dawned  in America.

  The grasshopper is found dead in a drug-related incident and  the house, now
  abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the  once
  peaceful neighborhood.

Sister Margaret died and through some error found herself in hell. She
  immediately called Saint Peter and said, "This is Sister Margaret. There's
  been a terrible mistake!"


  She explained the situation and Saint Peter said he'd get right on it. The
next day the nun didn't hear from Saint Peter and called him back.
  "Please set this error straight before tomorrow," she begged. "There's an
orgy planned for tonight, and everyone must attend!"


  "Of course, Sister, "he said. "I'll get you out of there right away."
  Apparently, her plight slipped his mind, and the following morning he
  received another phone call from hell. He picked up the receiver and
  heard, "Hey, Pete, this is Maggie. Never mind!"

Lessons of the Geese


This Fall, when you see geese heading south for the winter flying along in 
"V" formation, you might consider what science has discovered as to why they 
fly that way.


FACT: As each bird flaps its wings, it creates an "uplift" for the bird 
immediately following. By flying in a "V" formation, the whole flock has at 
least 71% greater flying range than if each bird flew on it's own.
LESSON: People who share a common direction and sense of community can get 
where they are going more quickly and easily because they are traveling on 
the thrust of one another.


FACT: When a goose flies out of formation, it suddenly feels the drag and 
resistance of trying to go it alone. It quickly gets back into formation to 
take advantage of the lifting power of the bird in front of it.
LESSON: If we have as much common sense as a goose, we stay in formation with 
those headed where we want to go. We are willing to accept their help and 
give our help to others. It is harder to do something alone than together.


FACT: When the lead goose gets tired, it rotates back into the formation, and 
another goose flies to the point position.
LESSON: It is sensible to take turns doing the hard and demanding tasks and 
sharing leadership. As with geese, people are interdependent of each others 
skills, capabilities, and unique arrangements of gifts, talents, or resources.


FACT: The geese flying in formation honk from behind to encourage those up 
front to keep up their speed.
LESSON: We need to make sure our honking is encouraging. In groups where 
there is encouragement, the production is much greater. The power of 
encouragement (to stand by one's heart or core values and encourage the heart 
and core of others) is the quality of honking we seek. We need to make sure 
our honking is encouraging and not discouraging.


FACT: When a goose gets sick, wounded, or shot down, two other geese will 
drop out of formation with that goose and follow it down to lend help and 
protection. They stay with the fallen goose until it dies or is able to fly 
again. Then, they launch out on their own, or with another formation to catch 
up with their flock.
LESSON: If we have the sense of a goose, we will stand by our colleagues and 
each other in difficult times as well as in good!

Dog bites threaten home insurance
Homeowner coverage may be cancelled if your pooch is considered too aggressive


Charles V. Tines / The Detroit News

MetLife no longer writes coverage for people who own a pit bull or four other 
dogs with attitudes.

By Charlie Cain / News Lansing Bureau Chief

    A sizable increase in the number -- and severity -- of dog bites in Metro 
Detroit is increasingly forcing insurance companies to cancel homeowner 
policies at homes where the family pooch has displayed a bad attitude.
    At least one national insurance company, MetLife Auto & Home, no longer 
writes homeowner coverage for people who own any of five different breeds of 
large, often aggressive, dogs: pit bulls, rottweilers, chow chows, German 
shepherds and bull terriers.
    "Our overall position is that if you have one of those breeds in your 
household, we will not insure you because we don't believe there's a way to 
match the risk with the rate," said Richard Bernstein, a MetLife 
vice-president.
    "Dog bites tend to be difficult cases, emotionally traumatic and costly."
    The Insurance Information Institute in New York said insurers now 
shoulder a quarter of the record $1 billion cost associated with dog bites -- 
from medical treatment to "pain and suffering" damage awards.
    A third of all homeowner claims result from dog bites; about 70 percent 
of insurance carriers won't renew coverage to a policyholder whose dog has 
bitten someone.
    "We're seeing a surge of dog bite claims with pit bulls and rottweilers," 
said Mike Erwin, a spokesman for the institute, which represents about 350 
companies nationwide.
    "Those are not just a nip, but a tearing of the skin that requires a lot 
more medical treatment and as a result, the costs go up."
    Dogs were particularly aggressive in Detroit last year; the city reported 
1,574 dog bites -- up 38 percent from 1996.
    Macomb County reported 1,020 dog bites last year, up 9.5 percent from a 
year earlier.
    The Oakland County Animal Shelter, which covers much of the county, said 
the number of bites there remained constant at about 800.
    Nationally, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said 4.7 
million dog bites were reported in 1997.
    Justin Harbert, a 4-year-old Warren boy, joined the growing list of 
victims last week when a neighbor's chow chow lunged at his throat. It took 
12 stitches to close the boy's wound in Bi-County Hospital.
    "It didn't really dawn on me that there might be a problem," said his 
father, Gary Harbert, who was taking his son to breakfast and stopped briefly 
at the neighbor's house.
    "I saw my son go to pet the dog and the dog jumped across the table and 
went for his throat."
    The Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that nearly 
half of all children will be bitten by age 12.
    Gary Mitchell, a spokesman for the Michigan Association of Insurance, 
said the larger dogs that people are buying now to protect their homes are a 
particular concern. Too often, the dogs are bred to be vicious at puppy 
mills, he said.
    "More people will be bitten by poodles and cocker spaniels than pit bulls 
this year simply because there are so many more of them," he said.
    "But the serious injuries are caused by dogs like the pit bull. The 
increase in lawsuits is the result of the attacks by these large, aggressive 
animals.
    "People want them for protection, but the problem is these dogs often 
don't know the difference between a burglar and the kid next door or the 
mailman. Those are the people who are being bit and those are the people that 
are suing."
    Last year, 2,795 postal carriers were bitten and the U.S. Postal Service 
now is routinely suing dog owners. 
    Farmington Hills attorney Sam Bernstein said his office handles "quite a 
few" dog bite claims and he has seen "a lot of gruesome attacks, particularly 
by dogs whose owners allow them to roam the neighborhood."
    He said Michigan is like 30 other states with strict liability laws that 
say if your dogs bites someone, you're responsible.
    "There seems to be much more serious injuries today among people who are 
bitten by dogs," Bernstein said.
    State Farm Insurance, Michigan's largest provider of homeowner insurance, 
said it had 441 dog bites claims last year, up nearly 41 percent from 1996.
    "For the last two years, Michigan has been the fifth-highest state in the 
amount paid out in dog claims by State Farm," said John Carroll, a company 
spokesman.
    The insurer's Michigan costs last year were $81,367 in medical claims and 
another $3.27 million to settle liability claims.
    "We don't deny coverage based on breed since any breed can be trained to 
bite," Carroll said. "But after one bite, we insist the homeowner resolve the 
situation.
    "The policy will be discontinued if they continue to keep the dog on 
premises."
    Dan Hattaway, a dog bite expert at State Farm's national headquarters in 
Bloomington, Ill., said the company had 14,000 dog bite claims last year -- 
up 27 percent from 1996.
    "We had been running at about a 3 p________________________________

Hey Aunt Bonnie,

I thoroughly enjoyed your visit as well.  It has been too long since the last 
time we got together.  I hope that we get to see more of each other in the 
coming years.   Hopefully, we can make a trip up to Pennsylvania soon.

Love,

Eric

Subject: Flag Football Schedule

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Brian

Subject: Flag Football Schedule

Heat,

I have good news and bad news.  The bad news is that Danny Campbell, our 
esteemed Enron Flag Football President, left the company and forgot to
tell us that our first game was...last night.  So we forfeited our first 
game.  The good news is that it was against the Raiders, and we probably 
wouldn't
have won anyway.  

Here is the schedule.  Enron's Team 3 is probably not going to play, so this 
means that we'll have some open dates unless they decide to reschedule.
Take note that we're playing in the City League again this fall, but the 
location has changed.  We're going to play at Jaycee Park.  Directions are
below.  Sorry about the confusion this week, but I'll see you on the field 
next Wednesday night.

Brian

 "Conduct of Texas Fans at Friday's Football Game Dismays Former Student"

 November 28, 2000

 Dear Battalion and Daily Texan:

Please help me.  As a product of both Texas A&M and the University of
Texas - Austin, I thought I had learned a lot.  But I experienced some new
things at the football game this past Friday that my education had not 
prepared
me for.  No doubt there are Longhorn scholars who can set me straight.  I
watched many joyful Texas fans along with a few Aggies tailgating and
carousing.  Super.  Fall football rivalry.  Spirits were literally in
abundance.  May the better football team win.

Then I saw things that I cannot really comprehend.  I saw a Longhorn fan
with a t-shirt showing a fallen-over Bonfire.  The caption read, "What's
wrong, Aggies? Can't keep it up?"  Can someone explain that to me?  I do
not get it.  I assure you, I get the sexual nuance - I just do not understand
evil.

I saw Longhorn fans mocking and taunting the fans from A&M who were in
Corps of Cadets uniforms.  "Little Hitlers," they were called.  They were 
being
spat at.  Help me to understand this Longhorn slant on rivalry.  I
thought we were all against Hitler - Longhorns and Aggies.

I saw a Longhorn cheerleader - isn't he supposed to represent UT in the
finest possible way?  - run in front of the Aggie Band, turn and face it
square on and salute with the clicked heels, arm-above-head, "Heil
Hitler" sign. 

What don't I know here?  What didn't I learn in history class?  All these
things happened before kickoff.

Aggies, I respect your presentation of a $50,000 endowed scholarship as a
thank-you for UT's respect and support shown last year.  That support
obviously came from the finer Horns.  I admired the fortitude and
restraint exercised by the Corps of Cadets under attack.

Unfortunately, I learned that hundreds and hundreds of Longhorns have
More than one way to show the Hook 'em Horns sign.  They prefer to use their
middle finger.  Class.  Really intelligent and creative.  That will
quickly teach those "littlest" Longhorns how to show spirit.  I just pray they
get an honest chance to choose.

I am learning.  I have attended both schools.  I will choose the higher
ground.

why don't you just make the payment to them this month and we will set up the

Also,  I have been meaning to talk to you.  We agreed to terms on the TV,
but I wanted to ask something Aaron's rents gave me a 4 day Window to pay
between the 18th and 22nd and as you know at this moment in time I am living
paycheck to paycheck.  I am going to have a much higher paying job within
the next month but for now I am asking that you too can give me that Window.
For instance, my next check comes on the 20th and If I am due on the 18th ,
I will be late.

My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.  I don't
know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be
sitting much - most of the students stand up the entire game.  So, if you
want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.

Jason - if you and Donnita want to come, you can have my two extra seats in
the student section, assuming what I said above is correct.

I have only received dues from Dave and Steve!So,  I think Jason is going to go to the game now.  So, I need to buy you and 
Mom tickets.  Before I do that, do you have any friends at UH or UT (maybe 
Mr. Hamilton) that might have tickets.  If not, we can get some through a 
ticket broker or through a scalper the day of the game (probably the better 
way).  

Let me know

So this is how it will work.  Whenever the payment is due (the 18th).  You 
write me a check for $100.  I will pay the $1252.  

You will pay me $100/ month for 13 months ( so you last payment will be made 
to me on October 18th, 2001).
Payments will be due to me on the 18th of every month - NO EXCEPTIONS -  I 
cannot do this deal if you do not pay me on time - I will not make any 
exceptions for you.

Let me know if this is ok with you and I will work up a contract.

September 6, 2000 WSJ

Bush vs. the Press
A Washington adage holds that a politician commits a "gaffe" when he
inadvertently tells the truth. This is how we read George W. Bush's
off-the-record aside that New York Times reporter Adam Clymer is a "major
league" you-know-what.

In that refreshingly incautious remark caught Monday by an open microphone,
Mr. Bush was admitting, albeit unintentionally, that his campaign has a
press problem. We aren't referring only to Mr. Clymer, whose performance
review has been ably undertaken by neo-liberal journalist Mickey Kaus at
kausfiles.com. We're talking about the general media double standard faced
by every prominent conservative politician.

As Democrat-turned-journalist Michael Barone has observed, the mainstream
media aren't pro-Democratic. They will sometimes take a Democrat to task,
especially if he violates a media shibboleth such as "campaign-finance
reform." But they are reliably anti-Republican. That is, in newsrooms across
the land there is noticeably greater skepticism, and often animosity, toward
politicians who are cultural conservatives or who want to restrict the scope
of federal power.

This rarely manifests itself in blatant partisanship or attacks. Instead the
slant shines through in the press pack's definition of what constitutes news
or the interpretation the pack puts on news. Consider the treatment of three
recent campaign episodes:

When Mr. Bush said back in the primaries that his favorite philosopher was
"Christ," he was downgraded on the spot by the press for pandering to the
"religious right." The implication was that he couldn't possibly mean it.
But now Democrat and liberal Joe Lieberman is making a much more frequent
and vocal issue of his own religious faith, and the same media that scolded
Mr. Bush are writing long, thoughtful treatises on the role of religion in
politics. And any criticism of Mr. Lieberman is accompanied with the caveat
that the Orthodox Jew really is sincere. This is a double standard.

Or take Mr. Bush's recent decision to run a TV spot attacking Mr. Gore's
credibility. This was reported, in the New York Times and elsewhere, as
going "negative," primarily as a response to Mr. Gore's rise in the polls.
But what about the weeks-long TV-ad hammering that Democrats have laid on
Mr. Bush -- for his Texas record, and even during the GOP convention on his
running mate's 15-year-old voting record? The Gore attacks were reported as
legitimate subjects of political debate. We happen to think all of these are
legitimate, but only Mr. Bush's got the good-housekeeping media's "negative"
label.

Then there is the debate over Presidential debates. This back and forth is a
hardy perennial, and you'd think the press would merely let both sides duke
it out. But in the coverage we've seen, Mr. Bush's proposal to break from
the Commission on Presidential Debates mold is being treated as an attempt
to dodge debates or attract a smaller audience. Mr. Gore's decision to
renege on his pledges to debate on NBC's "Meet the Press" and CNN's "Larry
King Live" don't get the same spin.

This criticism of Mr. Bush is especially galling when it comes from the
likes of ABC and CBS, who now whine that they won't carry debates held by
other networks. So much for their public-spiritedness. Their reaction shows
that the debate commission is less about designing a forum to educate voters
and more about dividing the commercial TV spoils equally. We hope Mr. Bush
sticks with his desire to have a less scripted, more open exchange with Mr.
Gore.

Mr. Bush has given signs before that he understands his party's media
problem better than most other Republicans. Indeed, we've long suspected
that his "compassionate conservative" theme was as much about media
management as policy. It was designed to deflect the inevitable media
portrayal of any Republican as a heartless, Gingrichian budget cutter. Mr.
Bush also stood up to the press pack when it sought to hound him about
rumors of youthful drug use.

We aren't suggesting that Mr. Bush should get into a pitched battle with the
press corps, and especially not with any one reporter. Our point is that Mr.
Bush won't be able to count on even-handed media coverage to carry his
battle to Mr. Gore. He's going to have to make his case directly, and not
too subtly, to voters over the heads of the media.

That means Mr. Bush would be better off doing more debates in several
forums. And, above all, it means setting his own agenda and strategy, no
matter if ankle-biters in the press corps call it "negative."

I got a Bed and Breakfast for Friday Night with one King Size Bed.  It will 
be nice and cozy for the six of us.

Just kidding - this is a pretty nice place - we have 2 dbls and the hotel is 
in between the stadium and 6th street.  (11th street).

the rate is $145.  the tickets are $30 - so - $54/person for everything.

we will leave at 4 on Friday if that is ok with everyone.




I hate it when I'm right, Kitna will be benched before week 2.  Garcia is 
still available, but I will need a starting RB - imight be able to swing 
another RB in the deal like Fred Beasley- Or you can start Ryan Leaf

Unfortunately the Dream Matchup has been nixed by the Cotton Bowl.  UT is no 
longer in consideration for a Cotton Bowl berth.  It would have been fun to 
see how you fare against a top 5 team.

Maybe we will see you next year.  Of course, you will have to make it to the 
Rose Bowl.

Good luck in Dallas!

I got my little review today.  It was a positive experience.  She didn't 
really say anything negative at all- and she even commented that she felt bad 
not giving me any constructive criticism- but that she was really surprised 
at how good of a job I did- with only being a rotator and having such limited 
work experience.  She said that after I finish my third rotation in EES she 
would like for me to consider taking a permanent position in her group.  We 
will talk about it more towards the end of this rotation.

So- I am currently NOT irritated.

Good afternoon. Mother suggested that maybe it  would be fun if the trip to 
see The University of Houston beat Texas @  Austin,were boys only. Say you, 
me and Jason. I suspect that has  to do?  with her "don't give a do-do" 
attitude about football. Thought I would pass it  on. What do  you think?-Dad

Have you heard anything about the reschedule date?Remember:

The free add/drop period will end on Wednesday Aug30 at noon.  After that 
point, we will submit add/drop bids to Pat at pryder@enron.com.  

To review:  add/drops will be done through an auction system.  If you want to 
pick up a player you need to submit a bid by e-mail to Pat by 5:00 PM on 
Wednesday of every week.  The person with the highest bid will receive the 
player ($0 bids are acceptable).  

Each team will start with $100 auction dollars.  Each week the team with the 
lowest total points year to date will get $12 added back to their total, the 
team with the highest YTD pt total will get $1 added back and teams in the 
middle will get their according dollar amount based on their rank in YTD pts.


ALL TRADES WILL BE ASSESSED A $5.00 flat fee.


Also, let me know how you want to handle dues (a total of $110).  Should I 
collect them up front ?

Mother,

I had offered to come and be there during your surgery.  Both you and Dad 
replied that it was not necessary because the surgery was not that serious 
and there was no timeframe on its completion.  You know that I love you and 
Dad very much, and that I do not have a favorite parent (if that was your 
implication with your last comment).

If you are unhappy with Jason's actions that is fine, but you have to 
remember that my brother and I are different people.  You cannot neccessarily 
associate his actions with mine.  Please take that into consideration.

I love you very much,

Eric

Dear Jason,
?
I know it has been two months since my  surgery.? I don't know why the 
feelings have finally surfaced.? I did  not even say anything to your father 
until today.? 
?
First of all, I expected to see 3 smiling faces  when I awoke in the recovery 
room.? I only saw one.? I was  devastated.? I will get over it but it has to 
run its course.? Nothing  would have prevented me from being by either one of 
your sides under similar  circumstances.? I know you have lives, work, etc., 
but you, especially,  always find time for friends in need, i.e, Donnita's 
mother and Donnita's  15-minute oral surgery.? Give me a break.?? But, the 
most heart  wrenching thing is, until today, you never gave it a second 
thought. How would  you have felt if I had not been there for you? The final 
blow, though, was the  realization that you would take time to be with 
somebody else's mother and take  an entire day off for Donnita's oral 
surgery.? Actions speak louder than  words.
?
I'll get over this.? In fact, I've gotten it  off my chest and this is the 
end of it.? But, I cannot help but wonder, and  I want you both to answer 
this truthfully, if it had been your father, would you  have been there?? 
Just curious.? You reap what you sow.? I guess  I was not very good at the 
sowing part.
?
Love, Mom

you tell me that you are cheating on me . . . .  interesting

my predicament at running back will last me one week, maybe two.  I think 
that i have a good enough team to withstand a bad start and make it to the 
playoffs anyway.  I don't value people by what round they are picked in.  
Engram was easily in my top 30 or 25 recievers while shroeder was barely in 
my top 50.  Raymont Harris has been out of football for a while, and is on a 
team that won't run the ball much.  This move would maybe help my team the 
first week, but it wouldn't help me in the long run.  So the answer is no

I think you are simply trying to get over on me like Harry did Lenhart.

ok, you want something fair, and you want dillon and davis in a package?

how about dillon and davis, for your whole team b/c that is the only trade

McCauffrey out.

jj johnson has shown nothing in preseason where as lamar has been excellent ,

if you don't like that is fine but it still doesn't change the fact that you

engram is ramiro's 4th receiver, you don't get a starting rb (the 10th best

the reason i want engram so bad is b/c i have his qb and i think he will
have a pretty good year.

by the way engram was picked the 8th round, dillon in the 2nd.

so don't give me any of that

Ramiro believes Engram is going to have a very good year.  He needs a

Hear anything on Engram?What is your offer on marcus robinson?Muhsin Muhammed and Elvis Grbac for Jeff Garcia, Raymont Harris, and Wayne 
Chrebet?


Gives you starting QB and depth at RB (all 4 of your RBs will likely not play 
week 1 and maybe 2).

Let me knowWhat do you want for Fred Taylor -  do you see he is out for the first 2 
weeks?Please take time to answer a new poll on the website!Alright,  I think this is a good deal for you! You get Depth at Receiver and 
Depth at Running Back.

Dillon, Chrebet, Schroeder, and Raymont Harris or Lamar Smith 

FOR 

Williams, Hayes, and Robert Smith

Your running backs suck.  I will give you Raymont Harris and Wayne Chrebet

The moratorium will last until noon on Wednesday, August 30th.  You can have

LSU Is Ranked Party School Champ
Distinction Disappoints University  Officials
BATON ROUGE, La., Updated 9:13 p.m. CDT August 16, 2000 --It's a  distinction
officials at Louisiana State University wanted to avoid, but now  the word is
out: LSU has been ranked the No. 1 party school in the Princeton  Review of
the nation's top colleges.
Despite seminars on alcohol abuse and  new policies for fraternities and
sororities regarding alcohol consumption,  LSU edged out the University of
Alabama for the top spot. The University of  Texas "won" third place.
Chancellor Mark Emmert said LSU is no more a party  school than any other
university.
The Princeton ranking was disheartening  news to university officials still
shaken after the Aug. 19, 1997, death of  an LSU student who drank
excessively during a celebration of his acceptance  into a fraternity.
Brigham Young University was dubbed the top "Stone Cold  Sober" school in the
review.

The top 20 "Party Schools," according to the Princeton Review:
1.  Louisiana State University
2. University of Alabama
3. University of  Texas
4. Florida State University
5. University of Colorado
6.  University of Tennessee
7. University of California at Santa Cruz
8.  Tulane University
9. University of Wisconsin
10. Ohio University,  Athens
11. University of New Hampshire
12. University of Michigan
13.  University of Vermont
14. Ohio State University
15. New York  University
16. Lehigh University
17. Southern Methodist University
18.  University of Florida
19. University of California at Santa Barbara
20.  Union College
The top 20 "Stone Cold Sober Schools," according to the Princeton  Review:
1. Brigham Young University
2. Wheaton College
3. California  Institute of Technology
4. U.S. Naval Academy
5. U.S. Coast Guard  Academy
6. Samford University
7. Cooper Union
8. Wellesley  College
9. Mount Holyoke College
10. Calvin College
11. Haverford  College
12. Golden Gate University
13. U.S. Air Force Academy
14.  College of the Ozarks

16. Wells College
17.  Simmons College
18. Illinois Institute of Technology

plove, 
you might  as well cut your losses.  you are not going to get over on someone

   A new book that says men may beat their wives has caused an outcry in
Turkey.
   The Guardian newspaper reports that "The Muslim's Handbook," written by
retired cleric Kemil Gubran, advised men not to hit too hard and to avoid
the face. It also said that if a man's wife is ill and he can't afford a
servant, he could take a second wife.
   The book was published by the state-funded Pious Foundation, which is
affiliated with Turkey's religious directorate. In the past decade, the
directorate -- which appoints Muslim clerics and dictates topics for
mosques -- has been presenting a modern interpretation of Islam to include
expanded roles and rights for women.
   "I am outraged that such a book was published with state funds, with
money women paid in taxes," said Zuhal Krilic, the head of Kader, a group
promoting women in politics.
   A book published in Spain several weeks ago also said a Muslim man could
beat his wife -- and included tips and instructions -- although it
counseled that the best way to bring a woman in line was through verbal abuse.

   

17 players on the roster

Starting Lineups for the league will include

1 QB
2 RB
3 WR
1 TE
1 K
1 Def

for hector, lenny and brian

1 Quarterback (he throws the ball)
2 Running Backs (they run the ball)
3 Wide Receivers (they catch ball)
1 Tight End (they catch and block)
1 Kicker
1 Defensive team




This is the last one and probably the best - near smu (connected by rail to 
downtown and near greenville - another bar area).  Might be a little more 
expensive but probably worth it.

by popular vote, the draft will take place at noon on 8/20 at BW-3 in rice

-EricTwo boys are playing football near Fayetteville, AR, when one of the boys is
attacked by a rabid Rottweiler.  Thinking quickly, the other boy rips a board
off of a nearby fence, wedges it down
the dog's collar and twists, breaking the dog's neck and saving
his friend's life.

A reporter who was strolling by sees the incident and rushes over
to interview the boy.  "YOUNG RAZORBACK FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM VICIOUS ANIMAL"
he starts writing in his notebook.

"But I'm not a Razorback fan," the little hero replies.
"Sorry," says the reporter, "since you live near Fayetteville, I just assumed
you were."

The reporter begins writing again, "BRAVE ARKANSAS STATE FAN RESCUES FRIEND
FROM HORRIFIC ATTACK."

The boy replies, "I'm not an Arkansas State fan, either."

"Oh. I assumed that everyone in Arkansas was either a Razorback fan or an
Arkansas State fan.  You must be a University  of Central Arkansas fan."

The reporter starts writing again "YOUNG UCA FAN SAVES FRIEND FROM MAD DOG."

The boy said, "I'm not a UCA fan either."

"Well, if you are not for the U of A, State, or UCA, just what team DO you
root for?" the reporter asked.

"Why, I'm an LSU fan!" the child replies.

The reporter starts a new sheet in his notebook: "LITTLE ILLITERATE COONASS
KILLS BELOVED FAMILY PET."

I know you had asked for some info on Texas previously.  Sorry it is so late, 
but here is a map of Tx pieplines.  The most notable (that are no on the 
current pipeline map) are Oasis, Lonestar, Valero, and HPL.


Thanks,

Mike, please give me a call at 3-0977 and we can set up a time that is good 
for you to observe.

Subject: I need your help!!

Michael Taylor is a summer intern from LSU, finance major, who has been 
working in Logistics for the Central Desk.  He will be at ENA for the next 
couple of weeks (through 8/11, I believe).  He has not had an opportunity to 
really see our business from the trading perspective or Risk perspective.  I 
had the opportunity to have lunch with Mike yesterday, and we brainstormed on 
some options to get him some exposure to these areas prior to leaving ENA.  
THis where I need your help!

Eric - As I always do, I sang your praises to Mike, and I thought you would 
be a good person for Mike to sit with to observe your current role in the 
analyst program on the Texas Trading Desk.  Additionally, since you were in 
Risk also, I thought you could give him an insightful perspective of how the 
Risk experience has helped you to move to your current role.  If you can 
swing it, I think it would be great if Mike could sit with you one day, and 
you could explain to him your job, your thoughts behind your actions, the 
data you watch, etc.  Obviously, the intent is educational, not 
interference.  So I will leave it to the two of you to work out the best 
approach and timing.

Dave - As I mentioned to you yesterday, I sang your praises also to Mike, and 
I'm glad the two of you were able to meet.  As we discussed, Mike would like 
to have some exposure to the Risk role, so it would be nice if he could sit 
with the group when the books and position are being calced.  I will leave it 
to the two of you to coordinate the day.

Mike's current role in Logistics brings him into the office at 4:00am to 
prepare the morning report.  As I understand it, his responsibilities are 
critical up until trading.  So late morning and early afternoon might be the 
best time, but you all can work through it.  When he sits with Risk, he'll 
probably go home and them return when you all start calcing.

George - Obviously Mike's first responsibilities are to Central Logistics, 
and these other opportunities are really on his own time.  We just thought it 
would be good for him to have a Risk/Trading perspective when he is trying to 
evaluate job opportunities.  I appreciate your support in this, but please 
let me know if you have any concerns.

When Mike leaves Enron, he will be going to Seattle to participate in 
MicroSoft's co-op program for the reaminder of 2000.  Obviously, he will have 
a great company to compare us to but at the end of the day, we want to ensure 
he has a great perspective on the opportunities that Enron can offer.  I 
appreciate your time to help Mike.

Warm fuzzies from Andy Rooney

I've learned....
    that the best classroom in the world is at the feet of an elderly person.
'   that when you're in love, it shows.
    that just one person saying to me, "You've made my day!" makes my day.
    that having a child fall asleep in your arms is one of the most peaceful
feelings in     the world.

I've learned....
    that being kind is more important than being right.
    that you should never say no to a gift from a child.
    that I can always pray for someone when I don't have the strength to help
him in  some other way.

I've learned....
    that no matter how serious your life requires you to be, everyone needs a
friend  to act goofy with.
    that sometimes all a person needs is a hand to hold and a heart to
understand.
    that simple walks with my father around the block on summer nights when I
was     a child did wonders for me as an adult.

I've learned....
    that life is like a roll of toilet paper. The closer it gets to the end,
the faster it   goes.
    that we should be glad God doesn't give us everything we ask for.
    that money doesn't buy class.
    that it's those small daily happenings that make life so spectacular.

I've learned....
    that under everyone's hard shell is someone who wants to be appreciated
and     loved.
    that the Lord didn't do it all in one day. What makes me think  I can?
    that to ignore the facts does not change the facts.
    that when you plan to get even with someone, you are only letting that
person  continue to hurt you.

I've learned....
    that love, not time, heals all wounds.
    that the easiest way for me to grow as a person is to surround myself
with    people smarter than I am.
    that everyone you meet deserves to be greeted with a smile.
    that there's nothing sweeter than sleeping with your babies and feeling
their   breath on your cheeks.

I've learned....
    that no one is perfect until you fall in love with them.
    that life is tough, but I'm tougher.
    that opportunities are never lost; someone will take the ones you miss.
    that when you harbor bitterness, happiness will dock elsewhere.

I've learned....
    that one should keep his words both soft and tender, because tomorrow he
may     have to eat them.
    that a smile is an inexpensive way to improve your looks.
    that I can't choose how I feel, but I can choose what I do about it.

I've learned....
    that when your newly born grandchild holds your little finger in his
little fist, that   you're hooked for life.
    that everyone wants to live on top of the mountain, but all the happiness
and     growth occurs while you're climbing it.
    that it is best to give advice in only two circumstances; when it is
requested and   when it is a life-threatening situation.
    that the less time I have to work with, the more things I get done.

Good Morning!

I wanted to let each of you know that I had no problem collecting sufficient 
performance data to present you to the Corporate PRC on Wednesday.  After the 
meeting I expect the results will be released to each of your PRC 
Supervisors.  You should expect them to complete your performance evaluation 
and schedule a meeting with you to discuss it.  If they do not, it is up to 
you to make the first move and ask to schedule the meeting.

Again, I enjoyed the opportunity to meet each of you and learn a bit of what 
you do.  I look forward learning even more.

Best Regards.

Big 12: Applewhite eager to reclaim his job
By Mark Wangrin
Express-News Staff Writer

AUSTIN =01* It runs up and down the inside of Major Applewhite's left knee,=
 a=20
four-inch shiny pink speed bump of a scar.=20

If it could talk, it would tell of how the anterior cruciate ligament buckl=
ed=20
as its owner planted while trying to avoid a relentless Arkansas pass rush =
at=20
the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1.

It would tell of the reconstructive surgery by team orthopedist Dr. Carey=
=20
Windler, how the joint was whipped back into shape with hours of work and=
=20
carefully tended with ice bags and heat and extra stretching and anything=
=20
else Applewhite had read, heard or seen that would help keep his return on=
=20
pace.

If the joint could talk, it would tell people how everything's fine inside,=
=20
how Applewhite could drop back and plant, set up or scramble, in a real liv=
e=20
game today if one was scheduled.=20

If it could talk ... well, Applewhite might well be the happiest guy on the=
=20
planet.

Being a quarterback, team guy and newly inaugurated Student Government=20
representative, Applewhite tries to be diplomatic, but part of him wishes h=
e=20
wouldn't have to answer a steady barrage of questions about his knee, no=20
matter how well-meaning the fans might be.

"I don't want to be rude," he said last week. "I just wish they'd stop=20
asking. I love them, appreciate them, but it's getting a little ..."

Got the picture.

OK. So here's the word: Applewhite is 100 percent =01* even ahead of schedu=
le.

Ready to take on the challenge to his starting job from sophomore quarterba=
ck=20
Chris Simms, who with only one career start has graced the cover of The=20
Sporting News football preview and had an ESPN Magazine cover shoot last we=
ek

This word on Applewhite's fitness comes not just from the junior player, bu=
t=20
from the man who's worked most closely with him, physical therapist Allen=
=20
Hardin.

Applewhite, Hardin stresses unequivocally, is ready to play now.

Hardin said Applewhite has tested 5 to 10 percent above the expected range=
=20
when he's had periodic strength and flexibility tests on the injured leg.=
=20
During rehab, Hardin ditched the pool work, concentrating instead on=20
sport-specific movements, shortly after Applewhite observed that very few=
=20
football games are played under water.

One of the most effective of the workouts involved pulling on Applewhite wi=
th=20
rubber tubing as the quarterback moved, cut and set up, strengthening his=
=20
supporting muscles and improving his balance.

"If I came in and told him to do what he did yesterday, he wasn't happy,=20
because he wanted to be challenged," Hardin said. "It was a challenge to co=
me=20
up with things to challenge him."

"The only difference I can tell about the knee is it takes longer to warm=
=20
up," Applewhite said. "I'll jog for four minutes instead of two, stretch fo=
r=20
six minutes instead of five."

After workouts, Applewhite dutifully ices his knee, though he does so based=
=20
more on conventional wisdom than necessity.

"I've always heard you can get tendinitis, so I ice it," he said. "I don't=
=20
have any of the symptoms, so it feels like I'm icing it for no reason."

In some ways, Applewhite feels he's better for the injury, not the least of=
=20
which being a renewed appreciation for the game.

"So what if I'm tired?" he said. "I can rest when I die."

Resting now isn't a bad thing, either. Applewhite said missing spring drill=
s=20
was a boon for his arm.

"I was throwing so much during the spring (of 1999), summer and season that=
=20
it felt like my arm was run ragged," he said.

Of course, the knee questions will be answered the first time Applewhite=20
takes a hit in the fall. The other question, the one that he can't shake,=
=20
will take a little longer.

Who's the starter going to be =01* Applewhite or Simms?

"I'd be quick to drop in comments about Chris," Hardin said of his=20
occasional, and apparently unnecessary, mention of Simms as a motivational=
=20
ploy. "But I think internally, he'd have worked that hard whatever."

"It's remarkable the way he's come back," said sophomore cornerback Roderic=
k=20
Babers, noting that Applewhite has been occasionally overthrowing even the=
=20
speediest receivers in workouts. "In two-a-days, it'll be a fair fight."

Asked to size up how Applewhite and Simms have looked in informal workouts,=
=20
Babers said, "I think (Simms) has the advantage. Major's been sitting out a=
nd=20
Simms' confidence is up, big-time. That's what you need in a quarterback. B=
ut=20
at the same time, Major's a veteran. He's beaten Nebraska. He's beaten them=
=20
all."

"He's the same old Major," cornerback Quentin Jammer said.

Soon Applewhite will probably be as tired of talking about the quarterback=
=20
duel as he is about answering questions about the state of his knee. Now, a=
=20
month before the freshmen report on Aug. 13, he's talking about how he's no=
t=20
competing against Simms, just against himself.

"The competitive nature that Tiger Woods has is the competitive nature I=20
have," Applewhite said. "At Pebble Beach, Tiger was up 15 and had a 10-foot=
er=20
on the last hole for birdie, and he was out there lining it up. He could ha=
ve=20
done the 'Happy Gilmore' tap to the hole and still won. But he wanted it al=
l."

Simms has bulked up from 208 to 223 pounds, working on his leg and upper bo=
dy=20
strength.

"I feel like there's more to me now, that it's not like the wind's going to=
=20
blow me over," he said. "I don't want to be a wimpy quarterback. I want to =
be=20
like Brett Favre. He's not the biggest or the fastest, but he can run when =
he=20
has to and he can chuck it 80 (yards).

"It's going to come, and it'll get worse," Simms said of the building=20
scrutiny. "To tell you the truth, I don't care. Football's a competitive=20
sport. There's nothing you can do about it."

So he shrugs it off for now, concentrating on finishing up summer school.=
=20
He's working on his topic for a writing course, "History of American=20
Baseball." The book he chose is about Babe Ruth.

In August, the topic switches to college football. The question remains the=
=20
same. And Chris Simms, or Major Applewhite, won't write this story.

They'll live it.

Thanks!  - R 

I offered you my 1 and 3 for your 1 and 4.  I can throw in my 5 for your 6.

Let me know.

EricI would like to trade for your 2nd pick in the draft.  I can offer you a 2nd 
round pick and a 9th round pick.  What do you think?

EricI will give you my 3rd and 9th round picks for your 2nd.

Let me know.You're right. We cheated by trying to screw everyone who isn't fortunate 
enough to work at Enron.  

Give it a rest.  The order was determined by an impartial 3rd party.

 WAKE UP AMER  A, THIS IS WHY OUR
 FOUNDING FATHERS PUT THE SECOND
 AMENDMENT IN OUR CONSTITUTION

Where We're Headed
    By Robert A. Waters
****************************************************************

 You're sound asleep when you hear a thump outside your
 bedroom door.

 Half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled
 whispers. At least two people have broken into your house
 and are moving your way.

 With your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed
 and pick up your shotgun. You rack a shell into the
 chamber, then inch toward the door and open it.

 In the darkness, you make out two shadows. One holds a
 weapon--it looks like a crowbar.

 When the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the
 shotgun and fire. The blast knocks both thugs to the floor.
 One writhes and screams while the second man crawls to
 the front door and lurches outside.

 As you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you're
 in trouble. In your country, most guns were outlawed years
 before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently
 regulated as to make them useless.
 Yours was never registered.

 Police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died.
 They arrest you for First Degree Murder and Illegal
 Possession of a Firearm.

 When you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry:
 authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter.
 "What kind of sentence will I get?" you ask.
 "Only ten-to-twelve years," he replies, as if that's nothing.
 "Behave yourself, and you'll be out in seven."

 The next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local
 newspaper. Somehow, you're portrayed as an eccentric
 vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir
 boys. Their friends and relatives can't find an unkind word to say
 about them. Buried deep down in the article, authorities
 acknowledge that both "victims" have been arrested numerous
 times. But the next day's headline says it all:
 "Lovable Rogue Son Didn't Deserve to Die." The thieves have
 been transformed from career criminals into Robin Hood-type
 pranksters.

 As the days wear on, the story takes wings. The national media
 picks it up, then the international media.

 The surviving burglar has become a folk hero. Your attorney
 says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he'll probably win.

 The media publishes reports that your home has been
 burglarized several times in the past and that you've been
 critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the
 suspects. After the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you
 would be prepared next time. The District Attorney uses this to
 allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars.

 A few months later, you go to trial. The charges haven't been
 reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted. When
 you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works
 against you. Prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean,
 vengeful man.

 It doesn't take long for the jury to convict you of all charges.

 The judge sentences you to life in prison.

__________________________________________

 This case really happened.

***********************************
 On August 22, 1999, Tony Martin of Emneth, Norfolk, England,
 killed one burglar and wounded a second. In April, 2000, he was
 convicted and is now serving a life term.

 How did it become a crime to defend one's own life in the
 once-great British Empire?

 It started with the Pistols Act of 1903. This seemingly
 reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and
 established that handgun sales were to be made only to those
 who had a license. The Firearms Act of 1920 expanded licensing
 to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns.
 Later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of
 any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of
 all shotguns.

 Momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after
 the Hungerford mass shooting in 1987. Michael Ryan, a
 mentally disturbed man with a Kalashnikov rifle, walked down
 the streets shooting everyone he saw. When the smoke cleared,
 17 people were dead.

 The British public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of "gun
 control", demanded even tougher restrictions. (The seizure of all
 privately owned handguns was the objective even though Ryan
 used a rifle.)

 Nine years later, at Dunblane, Scotland, Thomas Hamilton used
 a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at
 a public school.

 For many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as
 mentally unstable, or worse, criminals. Now the press had a real
 kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners. Day after day,
 week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and
 demanded a total ban on all handguns.
 The Dunblane Inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the
 few sidearms still owned by private citizens.

 During the years in which the British government incrementally
 took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right
 to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism. Authorities
 refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened,
 claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to
 own a gun. Citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were
 charged while the real criminals were released. Indeed, after the
 Martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying, "We
 cannot have people take the law into their own hands."

 All of Martin's neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and
 several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young
 thugs who had no fear of the consequences. Martin himself, a
 collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or
 stolen by burglars.

 When the Dunblane Inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns
 were given three months to turn them over to local authorities.
 Being good British subjects, most people obeyed the law. The few
 who didn't were visited by police and threatened with ten-year
 prison sentences if they didn't comply.

 Police later bragged that they'd taken nearly 200,000 handguns
 from private citizens.

 How did the authorities know who had handguns?

 The guns had been registered and licensed. Kinda like cars.

 Sound familiar?

Subject: Analyst PRC Review

Eric,

Let me introduce myself.  I am currently Director of Tax for the Enron India 
business unit and have been with Enron in various Tax functions for 
approximately 5 years.  I have been asked to sit on the Enron Corp. 
Performance Review Committee as PRC Representative for a group of  18 
Analysts, including you.  Your 6/2000 performance results will be presented 
to the PRC on 19-July PRC, along with all other Analysts.  

I want to make certain we both take full advantage of the PRC process.  To 
that end, I need you to bring me up-to-speed on your pre-Enron background and 
what you have accomplished while at Enron, in particular during the 6/2000 
review period, and what you intend to accomplish this year (your "goals").  
With this information, I can be best prepared to speak of your achievments 
during the 19-July PRC presentation.  

Here's what I need -

resume (most recent is fine,  even if out of date)
name of your "PRC Supervisor" ( i.e., the person who has gathered your 6/2000 
Feedback)
location and phone extension
your goals for the 2000 year (if these were not formalized, I would 
appreciate your doing so)
accomplishments this review period (especially toward achievement of your 
stated goals)
outside activities which support the community, especially those where your 
represent "Enron" (e.g., charitable endeavors)
other activities you are involved in which support "Enron" as a whole (e.g., 
college recruiting)

One last thing, please forgive the somewhat impersonal use of email.  I would 
like to meet you in person and hope that we can arrange that early next 
week.  Would you be available Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon (11/12-July) for 
30 minutes?  We could use that time to run through your background materials.

Please furnish the name of your "PRC Supervisor" by email ( my list indicates 
it is Tom Martin ) so that  I can contact them for a copy of the business 
unit PRC materials that should have recently been completed for you.

Thanks for your help ... I look forward to meeting you !

Celeste,

I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the 
program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you 
informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid 
year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only 
reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was 
tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible 
for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.

I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this 
PRC?

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

Hi Everyone,

Well, it's official.  I am finally making the final arrangements for my move 
to London!  I leave Friday, July 14th, but before I go I would like to throw 
a going away bash.  It's been awhile since we've all been out together so I 
hope you can make it.  I am sure that I have forgotten people, so please 
forward the email on.

The festivities will commence at my apartment next Friday, July 7th....at my 
apartment.  I'll be providing beer and wine but feel free to bring your 
favorite beverage.  I live a block away from the Galant Knight...if you can't 
make it to the apartment, meet up with us at the Galant Knight on Holcombe.

I live at 7777 Greenbriar #3056.  My gate code is 284.  If you need 
directions, leave me a message on my voice mail and I'll call you 
back...since I will out on vacation for most of next week.

I hope to see you all!

Carrie
Good to finally hear from.  Judging from your e-mail, it sounds like you had 
some fun in your exercises- I guess that English degree is finally paying off.
Luckily you missed out on another series of disappointments from the Longhorn 
football team.  It seems as though they are improving, however.  Hopefully we 
will be playing for the National Championship next year.  

How are things otherwise?  When are you coming into town again?

Looks nice.  I just had my meeting with my V.P.- looks like I will be doing 
my next rotation through EES tax (starts Aug 15th).  I hear it is a real good 
group to work with (real smart and nice people)- but I think they put in a 
lot of overtime- especially during federal compliance and some during state 
compliance time.  Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so 
going before I rotate in August  might not be a bad idea- although I really 
think they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for.  Side 
thought- when in the hell am I going to study for the CPA- especially since I 
have NO motivation and I am about to enter a group that has lots of OT.  You 
do realize that I am never going to pass that exam- and I'll probably lose my 
job- and then either you or my family will just have to take care of me.  I 
am feeling a little stressed/anxious today for some reason- in case you 
didn't pick up on that.  I definately feel like I need a vacation.

It looks like we have our 12 teams.  We will probably keep the same rules 
from last year unless anybody has an objection.  Still to be determined are 
league fees, draft date , and free agent pickup protocol.  I suggest that we 
draft on August 27th at the Enron building on floor 26.  For those of you 
that can't make it, you can draft over the internet.  We will be using cbs 
sportsline again - I think that will be $8/person.

Let me know if anyone has a problem with the draft date, i.e. can't make it, 
too early, too late.
If not, THE MEXIMULLETS look forward to a return to Prominence this year.  
You all do not stand a chance!

-Erici think this is a call for help.  maybe you should provide with some service 
tonight?

It is coming up on that time again.  The most glorious time of year.  The 
time of the year when life begins anew.  No, not spring, FOOTBALL SEASON!

That being said, it is time to start thinking about fantasy football again.

I need to know who of you is interested in playing again, and any suggestions 
on rule changes (i.e. scoring, fees, etc.). I was thinking about having the 
draft in late August.

Let me know if you have any friends that you think might want to play.


-Eric




let me see how many are interested.  i am aiming for 12 and i already have at 
least 10 (hull, you, me, jason, mick, harry, hector, matt, gary lam., ramiro)

Subject: FANTASY FOOTBALL 2000

It is coming up on that time again.  The most glorious time of year.  The 
time of the year when life begins anew.  No, not spring, FOOTBALL SEASON!

That being said, it is time to start thinking about fantasy football again.

I need to know who of you is interested in playing again, and any suggestions 
on rule changes (i.e. scoring, fees, etc.). I was thinking about having the 
draft in late August.

Let me know if you have any friends that you think might want to play.

Celeste,

I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the 
program affect my eligibility for promotion.  At the end of last year you 
informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid 
year review (my 2 year anniversary).  It was my impression that the only 
reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was 
tenure.  Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible 
for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.

I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this 
PRC?

Thank you in advance for your prompt attention to this matter.

hit them.  So I will draw up some plays.


What do you think?you know that all of us (Matt, Chad, and I)are just fucking with you about 
the EES bullshit.  if it bothers you that much then say something about it.  
as far as my comments on your performance here, i was just kidding.  i know 
that brenda thinks the world of you and that you wouldn't have stayed even if 
invited, besides, i learned from the intramonth guru himself.  i was just 
trying to defend myself because you were saying that all i do is follow tom's 
lead.  and, by the way, i did not make a comment about ees until you brought 
up the cfa.  i know that you, matt, and chad think that i had nerves and that 
is why i didn't take the test, but why the hell would i have nerves about a 
test that has no bearing whatsoever on my future.  

so quit the bullshit, and, TEXAS will still beat the shit out of LSU on Sat.

Look man, you started this shit by bringing up the same cheap EES comments 
that you always do when you have nothing better to say.  When I have to put 
up with that lack of respect from you on a daily basis, I consider it below 
the belt.  I would have liked to keep this to the game, but for some reason 
you always add the bit about EES.  Besides, don't throw Brenda choosing 
between you and Heidi in my face.  That doesn't add much credibility.

Between friends,  life and work are not constant competitions to see who's 
smarter or who makes more money.  I was genuinely happy for you when you 
decided to stay on at the desk.  As a matter of fact, I remember giving you 
advice, as a friend, on that very subject.  I hold no resentment or jealousy 
that you got it and I didn't.  I wouldn't have taken it anyway.  I neither 
liked my job in risk or felt that I was exceptional at it.  But, I did it 
well enough to bide time and move on to something that I'm more suited for.  
My move to EES wasn't a banishment, but a choice.  It was a risk that paid 
off very well.  Of course you are better at what you do than I.  But I 
seriously doubt you could be as effective as I am in front of a Customer or 
managing a project.  It's all about what you do well and being happy with 
that.  I'm glad we both are, but attempting to make me or my position less 
important because I don't work on the trading floor is just typical ENA 
arrogant bullshit.

....And you have no history about getting hammered and hooking up with skanks 
(i.e. Indian Princess.)  At least I don't take them on dates (that was 
justified.)  Now let's cut this crap and move on. 

Or I'll send my Dad to beat up your Dad.

Excerpt from Baseball America on 2000 CWS.

Bass, give it up.  You are done.

The Tigers wear the mantle of favorite well. They have won
                    nine straight games in postseason play, including the 
Southeastern
                    Conference tournament. They are relatively healthy. They 
have power
                    hitters, they have patient hitters, and they can field 
better than recent
                    versions of the club. Best of all, they have a lot of 
arms, and they have
                    Bertman around to use them. 



















You had to hit below the belt.  We were having a friendly shit talking 
contest, which, by the way, you started, and then you took the gloves off.

What's up with that?I guess it isn't as tough as EES, you're right.  I would hate to have to come 
to work at 9:00 am and leave at 5:00 everyday.  I guess I just had this

Dear Eric,

Another 25,417 Petitions were shipped to Florida today by
ElectionIntegrity2000.com.

Thanks to you we expect to have 100,000 signed petitions to
finalize the certification of the George W. Bush victory by
the end of the day today.  That's great news!

ElectionIntegrity2000.com has already been mentioned on
CSPAN and in the San Francisco Chronicle, but what we really
want is to turn the heads of the major networks -- and
that's going to take numbers.

Right now the mainstream media is claiming that the will of
the people favors Al Gore.  We can turn the tide --
especially if we have several hundred thousand Americans
behind us.

So don't give up!  Keep forwarding our messages, or tell
your friends directly to visit
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com

"Hand counting" of ballots is still going on in
several counties in Florida.  Make no mistake, this fight
is far from over.  That's why we are going to keep
collecting petitions until George W. Bush is officially
certified as President-elect and until Al Gore concedes.

Remember, with every day that passes without a certified
Bush victory, Al Gore's chances of stealing this election
increase.

For Election Integrity,

			Mock draft No. 1: Mihm's the word
			
?			
			
			
			
			
			
?	By Andy Katz
	ESPN.com
	
	With the number of impact players available in the NBA draft somewhere 
between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential 
of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams.
	
	NBA scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking 
heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the Chicago pre-draft 
camp June 6-9. Because so many players are relatively close in terms of 
talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several 
projections we'll have on ESPN.com.
	
	A number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but 
could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing 
in Chicago.
	
	The borderline first-rounders who didn't make ESPN.com's list but have a 
chance to move up are UCLA sophomore forward JaRon Rush, LSU senior center 
Jabari Smith, Temple junior guard Mark Karcher, UCLA freshman guard Jason 
Kapono, Purdue senior forward Brian Cardinal, Connecticut junior point guard 
Khalid El-Amin, Indiana senior guard A.J. Guyton, Ohio State senior point 
guard Scoonie Penn, Northern Arizona senior center Dan McClintock, Ohio State 
junior guard Michael Redd, Penn State senior center Jarrett Stephens, Turkey 
forward Hidayet Turkoglu and Nigerian forward Olumide Oyediji.
	
	Any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next 
month. The problem for underclassmen such as Kapono and Karcher is they must 
decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft. Underclassmen have until 
June 21 to pull their name out and still return to school. Rush, El-Amin and 
Redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what 
happens.
	
	ESPN.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock 
draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of May 22.
	
	
	
	
	Chris Mihm
	
	Mihm towered over much of the competition in college.
	
	1. New Jersey -- Chris Mihm, 7-0, Jr., Texas: The Nets need a center and 
could go with Mihm or Kenyon Martin, but the pick here is Mihm. The Nets 
could either hold on to the pick and see if Jayson Williams plays next 
season, or deal it to the Bulls for the No. 4 and No. 7 picks.
	
	2. Vancouver - Kenyon Martin, 6-9, Sr., Cincinnati: The Grizzlies would be 
getting a steal by grabbing Martin at No. 2. He's the hardest-working player 
in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer. 
Martin could play next to Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Bryant Reeves. If the 
Grizzlies aren't ready to go with Martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade.
	
	3. Los Angeles Clippers - Stromile Swift, 6-9, So., LSU: The Clippers have 
already inquired about Swift and see him as a potential small/power forward 
(which goes against LSU coach John Brady's philosophy of how to use him 
defensively). But, if Swift knows he's going to the Clips, he could opt to 
return to school. He has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door 
open for a return.
	
	4. Chicago -- Joel Przybilla, 7-0, Soph., Minnesota: The Bulls need a center 
for their triangle offense. If they can't trade for Mihm, Przybilla is next 
in line. He needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better 
offensive product than Luc Longley was during the Bulls' championship runs.
	
	5. Orlando -- Marcus Fizer, 6-8, Jr., Iowa State: The Magic love Darius Miles 
but won't let Fizer drop below No. 5 if he's available. Fizer gives the Magic 
an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last 
season. Doc Rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.
	
	6. Atlanta -- Mike Miller, 6-8, Soph., Florida: The Hawks have been high on 
Miller for a month and won't let him slide past them. Miles might be a better 
scorer but Miller's versatility will win the Hawks over at No. 6. Atlanta 
wants a small forward over a big guard.
	
	7. Chicago -- Darius Miles, 6-9, HS, East St. Louis (Ill.): The Bulls can 
package Miles and Przybilla to the Nets or keep two players who could be 
solid players in the league. Miles might have more of an upside than Tracy 
McGrady. Tim Floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would 
have the patience to wait for Miles to develop.
	
	8. Cleveland -- Iakovos Tsakalidis, 7-1, Greece: The Cavs want size and the 
third-rated center in the draft is Tsakalidis. The Celtics covet him, too, 
but Cleveland might not give them the chance because of the Cavs' need for 
size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt. Reviews on Tsakalidis are 
split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.
	
	9. Houston -- Courtney Alexander, 6-5, Sr., Fresno State: Alexander could go 
higher but not above six. The Rockets need scorers and Alexander will produce 
during individual workouts. The choice of Alexander, DeShawn Stevenson, 
DerMarr Johnson or Morris Peterson is hard to argue. Alexander can rise over 
a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.
	
	10. Orlando -- DeShawn Stevenson, 6-5, HS, Washington Union (Fresno, Calif.): 
The Magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their 
three picks. If Miles is gone, Stevenson will be too by No. 11. Orlando has 
scouted him for months and Rivers can afford to let Stevenson mature without 
feeling pressured to play him next season.
	
	11. Boston -- DerMarr Johnson, 6-9, Fr., Cincinnati: Johnson can't slip past 
11 with his Lamar Odom-like skills on the wing. The Celtics need size but 
can't let a scorer get past them in the draft. Johnson learned defense from 
Max Good and Bob Huggins, so Rick Pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much 
different.
	
	12. Dallas -- Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Sr., Auburn: Trying to predict what Don 
Nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft. But the 
Mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt. They can't afford to go with a 
foreigner or a slower big man. N'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts 
and in Chicago -- if he shows.
	
	13. Orlando -- Mateen Cleaves, 6-2, Sr., Michigan State: The Magic have to 
take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough 
to spend the No. 5 or No. 10 pick on. Cleaves is at the top of the 
point-guard list list -- and would fit Rivers' style of play and coaching 
because of his leadership and toughness.
	
	14. Detroit -- Morris Peterson, 6-6, Sr., Michigan State: The Pistons won't 
let the local hero leave the state. Peterson gives them a scorer to go next 
to or in place of Grant Hill if he leaves via free agency. Peterson could go 
higher -- if he's gone, the Pistons will take Alexander or Johnson.
	
	15. Milwaukee -- Etan Thomas, 6-9, Sr., Syracuse: The Bucks want a power 
forward and Thomas is fourth on their list behind Martin, Fizer and Swift. 
None will be available by the time they pick. Thomas can give them a 
rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the 
Pacers.
	
	16. Sacramento -- Erick Barkley, 6-1, Soph., St. John's: The Kings need a 
backup point to Jason Williams. Barkley could come in and wouldn't be under 
any pressure to perform immediately. He's the No. 2 point guard behind 
Cleaves. 
	
	17. Seattle -- Quentin Richardson, 6-6, Soph., DePaul: Had Richardson stayed, 
he would have probably been in the lottery next season. But he doesn't fit 
all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the 
Sonics. He gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement 
Rashard Lewis, if he re-signs. 
	
	18. Los Angeles Clippers -- Keyon Dooling, 6-3, Soph., Missouri: The Clippers 
need a point guard but won't take one at No. 3. Dooling has the upside that 
some of the senior points don't carry into the draft. But the potential of 
being a mid-teens draft pick may scare Dooling into returning to school.
	
	19. Charlotte -- Jerome Moiso, 6-10, Soph., UCLA: Moiso could still slide up 
into the late lottery (maybe to Dallas) but if he falls, the Hornets will 
catch him. Moiso can play power forward or center for the Hornets because of 
his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket. The 
Hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.
	
	20. Philadelphia -- Jamal Crawford, 6-6, Fr., Michigan: The Sixers have 
already called on Crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off 
the bench. Crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first 
round, regardless of where he's being picked.
	
	21. Toronto -- Craig "Speedy" Claxton, 5-11, Sr., Hofstra: The Raptors have 
already begun working out point guards and have Claxton in their top five. If 
Cleaves, Barkley, Dooling and Crawford are all gone, Claxton is the natural 
pick for the Raptors.
	
	22. New York -- Jamaal Magloire, 6-11, Sr., Kentucky: The Knicks took some 
heat for taking Frederic Weis last year. Jeff Van Gundy wants tough, physical 
players. Magloire gets the nod over Jason Collier if the Knicks go big. 
Magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.
	
	23. Utah -- Hanno M"tt"l,, 6-9, Sr., Utah: The Jazz can't go wrong with 
picking M"tt"l, from nearby Utah. He can score from the wing, but he'll end 
up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small 
forward. If M"tt"l, doesn't go to the Jazz, he could slip out of the first 
round.
	
	24. Chicago -- Jeryl Sasser, 6-7, Jr., SMU: The Bulls have to find a point 
guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery. The most 
intriguing point guard left could be Sasser. He can play both guard 
positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the 
Bulls some versatility on the floor.
	
	25. Phoenix -- Jason Collier, 7-0, Sr., Georgia Tech: The Suns need another 
big guy to go with Luc Longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor 
together. Collier has more offensive potential than many big men. The Suns 
have the luxury to allow Collier a few years to develop into a NBA center.
	
	26. Utah -- Chris Carrawell, 6-6, Sr., Duke: The Jazz need to add athleticism 
and fresh legs, either with Carrawell or Oklahoma State's Desmond Mason. 
Carrawell will probably get the nod because of his Duke pedigree. He could 
still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.
	
	27. Indiana -- Donnell Harvey, 6-8, Fr., Florida: Harvey is getting rave 
reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early 
without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round. The Pacers 
have a history of going younger in the draft.
	
	28. Portland -- Soumaila Samake, 7-2, Cincinnati Stuff (IBL): The Blazers 
don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to 
jump from the fledgling IBL to the NBA. Samake has the size, shot-blocking 
skills and potential to be an NBA center. Arvydas Sabonis doesn't have many 
miles left in his legs.
	
	29. Los Angeles Lakers -- Desmond Mason, 6-6, Sr., Oklahoma State: Here's 
where any one of the bubble players could go, such as Rush, Karcher or 
Stephens. But Mason is a more polished, experienced player. He gives the 
Lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.

Yes, we have finally suckered some other Enron group into taking on Bryan 
Hull.  Just teasin', Bryan's last day with the Risk Team will be this Friday, 
June 2nd.  It wouldn't be right if we didn't send him off without his well 
deserved roasting.

This Thursday evening at 5:30 we will gather at Teala's on W. Dallas to bid 
Bryan farewell.

For future reference, Bryan will be joining the EOL group on the 26th floor 
on Monday, June 5th.  His extension will be the same so feel free to continue 
to harass him. 

See ya there! 

If, in haste, we have left anyone off our distribution please forward the 
invite on.

Thanx!

Yes- I realize that I typed it wrong after the fact- thanks.  Got my whole 
little credit card situation taken care of- they cancelled the whole account 
and are sending me a new card- not that you care.  Let me know around 5- when 
you are ready to leave for the little happy hour- and we can walk over

Some phrases you wish you could say at work:

1. Ahhh...I see the fuck-up fairy has visited us again...

2. I don't know what your problem is, but I'll bet it's hard to pronounce.

3. How about never? Is never good for you?

4. I see you've set aside this special time to humiliate yourself
in  public.

5. I'll try being nicer if you'll try being smarter.

6. I don't work here. I'm a consultant.

7. I can see your point, but I still think you're full of shit.

8. I like you. You remind me of when I was young and stupid.

9. You are validating my inherent mistrust of strangers.

10. I have plenty of talent and vision.  I just don't give a damn.

11. I'm already visualizing the duct tape over your mouth.

12. Any connection between your reality and mine is purely
coincidental.

13. I'm not being rude.  You're just insignificant.

14. Yes, I am an agent of Satan, but my duties are largely ceremonial.

15. You sound reasonable.  Time to up the medication.

16. And your crybaby whiny-butt opinion would be...?

17. Do I look like a people person?

18. This isn't an office.  It's Hell with fluorescent lighting.

19. I started out with nothing & still have most of it left.

20. You!... Off my planet!

21. Does your train of thought have a caboose?

22. Errors have been made.  Others will be blamed.

23. Not all men are annoying. Some are dead.

24. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality.

25. Can I trade this job for what's behind door 1?

26. Too many freaks, not enough circuses.

27. How do I set a laser printer to stun?

28. If I throw a stick, will you leave?

Any news on this data?

-EricWe are going to be rolling out a new product on EOL starting this bidweek.  
This product will be for physical delivery only on the weekdays (no weekend 
delivery).  Currently, the EOL/Sitara Bridge cannot handle this type of 
logic, so these deals will have to be input manually.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Subject: 24 x 5 Products

We are rolling out the use of the 24 x 5 Nat Gas Product commencing tomorrow, 
May 24th. 

The Product is a month-long Physical Nat Gas Product traded off the Texas 
desk. It will be identified as follows:

US Gas Phy       Exxon Katy WkD          Jun00           USD/MM

This Product is different from the usual Products traded on the Texas Desk in 
that the Product  description has an 
indicator of  WkD, which designates that the Product only moves gas on a day 
that is a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
Thursday or Friday.

These Products WILL NOT bridge into Sitara. Risk personnel will need to be 
diligent to identify these Products based 
on the information in the Product Description to ensure that the Products are 
entered into Sitara correctly (presumably - 
strips of Monday-Friday trades and the corresponding month-starting days 
and/or month-ending days).

We understand the potential impact of having to manually input these 
transactions and have asked the appropriate
systems personnel to examine the links between EOL and Sitara and consider 
building bridge capability. In the
interim, we anticipate that the trading volume on these Products will be low, 
and will ask for higher prioritization of the
bridging in the event that volumes increase.

Practice tonight at  Memorial Park,  7pm.     Meet at same place as Monday 
night.



IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a split in 
the road with a softball and soccer field on your right hand side, and beck's 
prime on the left..  We will meet at the soccer/softball field for practice. 


If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as the tennis courts...


===


If   you are interested in wagering....   here are some bets that Webb 
Jennings is putting out on the 1 st game.


We spot them:  Total Bet:

9 pts   $50
15 pts   $300
22 pts   $500-$600
30 pts   $1,000

He seems to be extra confident in that he has a former Division 2A 
quarterback... Drew Teamlys  (sp?).

Subject: Well Head Accrual Income Calculation

Eric,

We've reviewed your wellhead accrual income data for February, 2000 and 
present our input on the attachment.  Generally, we have a few minor 
questions relating to the Comstock/Sun deals (do improper prior bookings 
account for the difference between the purchase price in some cases - ie. 
$2.477 vs. 2.508?) and certain deals do not appear to be wellhead related 
(Western Gas 500752 & 507804 and Pan Energy 500560).  The dollar amount 
involved are quite minor.

I believe, on a going forward basis, the large Coastal negative number 
($92,233) will disappear beginning on 4/1/2000.  As we discussed, would you 
therefore provide us with your wellhead accrual income data for April, 2000 
so we can see the net effect of correcting the Coastal booking?  Thanks.

Here is the wh data.  I have included the file for February only.  Keep in

so it is impossible to estimate accrual revenue/expense in the system 
accurately.  I have made top level adjustments to these deals.

the 10 teams in the leauge make the playoffs). Let me know if you're still

Facility fees should be part of the accrual value that fall's out each month 
( as long as the deals are in the WH portfolio).  This value should not be 
given to Sharp unless he bears the cost of the facilities.  There is a file 
in my folder that has a listing of some of the deals that have facility 
fees.  For further info contact Vance Taylor. (the file is called fac costs)

In addition,  I am forwarding an e-mail sent by George Weissman to me

huge negative each month should have been restructured in April.  Could you 
check into this and get back to him?

Are the facility fees part of the accrual piece we are holding out for Greg 
Sharp?  If not, how can we find the deals we have held out value to cover 
these fees?

Things to Remember:
We cannot see the future. We cannot change the past.
We can only live in the now with an eye towards
gaining enough power in the future to wreak revenge on
everyone who ever screwed us in the past.

Dreaming frees the soul, energizes the spirit and
allows you to do things that would get your ass thrown
in jail if you really tried them.

Love means never having to say, "Does that twenty
include the spanking?

To truly love another, you must first love yourself.
And it wouldn't kill you to wash your hands in between
either.

A little bit of love goes a long way in our lives. It
can provide us with higher highs and lower lows. But,
if it comes with a persistent burning sensation, see
your physician.

When it becomes a crime to love, you should probably
consider dating outside the family.

If Life hands you lemons today, smile and give thanks.
Then when Life isn't looking, give him a quick knee to
the groin. That'll learn him.

They say a smile is a gift which is free to the giver
and precious to the recipient. But giving the finger
is free, too, and I find it more personal and sincere.

Subject: Daily Throughput Data

We have access to a pretty realistic (close to actual) physical throughput 
number going back to about February of 1998.  Anything prior to that would 
take some work to come up with.  If you are looking for a scheduled 
throughput number the best place to get that data from would be POP's/Unify.  
By totalling all of the reciept or delivery contracts and including any 
Bammel activity, you should get a pretty accurate scheduled throughput 
number.  You just have to make sure you don't double dip on gas going through 
processing plants, partnership activity, etc.

Let me know what you and Ed are looking for and we can help pull the data 
together.

Thanks

Michael - can you give me an idea of where we are in uploading the Specs for 
this.

Eric, our biggest concern with this right now is the valuation for the 
Products that you would see in your Position Summary. We know that is we 
passed these trades through the system as a straight month-long transaction, 
that the valuation would be wrong. Additionally, the start and end dates will 
skue the valuation based on which day of the week the first calendar day of 
the month falls on and which day of the week the last calendar day of the 
month falls on. Using a straight 5/7 valuation methodology is only going to 
get you 'close' to true value in the Position Summary. Hence, the specs sent 
to Mike that you see in the e-mail below will need to be built.

In short, Eol was not set up to readily accept this valuation methodology. We 
will get you as close as we can, and we will give you some idea of how close 
these Position Values will be. 

Also, can you confirm that you intent to always and ONLY trade this Product 
during bid week?

Mark & Michael,
Remember we had discussed this when you were here.
The question is ......................in EOL Reports there is a Position 
Summary Report and in Stack Manager there is the Transaction Summary.
will these calculate properly on the 24x5 product? The start date & end date 
will imply every day but the product excludes weekends.

Subject: Re: Wellhead Accrual Income

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
"accrual value" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =       
$105,000
Accrual Value =                               $53,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000
Actual Volumes>Booked =         $60,000           $118,000 
Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

February-

Total Accrual Value = $289,305

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $145,000     Bid to Mid =       
$100,000
Accrual Value =                               $62,000    Accrual Costs 
=       $13,000

Total Value =                                   $177,000

March - 

Total Accrual Value = $292,145

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $147,000     Bid to Mid =

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you,

We need these locations set up to trade financial products for now.  We will

Dulce firmness may be a problem for physical, but as of now we are only going 
to trade it financially.

Since the Product Type description is "US Gas Basis", it is implied that the 
swap is against last day NYMEX and some othe MONTHYL CONTRACT PRICE, which is 
why we specify GD/D, so the viewer knows its a NYMEX last day vs. Gas Daily 
Average price. Take a look at the Indexes used in the other Basis swaps that 
are out there and you'll see what I mean.
I'm a little concerned about the request for Agua Dulce and Carthage. If 
memory serves me, Elsa tried to push these through earlier and it was 
determined that gas at these delivery points was interruptable. Interruptable 
gas is NOT offered on EOL. PLease check with Elsa on this.

On the new Gas Daily product that you are setting up, I think it would be a 
good idea to have a Nymex reference in the short description.  Something 
like, US Gas Daily NX GD/D HSC. 


In addtion, we need two new index locations set up, Carthage hub and Agua 
Dulce hub.  Please contact Todd Richardson for further details on these.

Here is the wh data.  I have included the file for February only.  Keep in 
mind that some deals, such as Costilla, have multiple tickets in the system 
so it is impossible to estimate accrual revenue/expense in the system 
accurately.  I have made top level adjustments to these deals.

Thanks to all of you for your generosity and support of the MS-150.  This 
year's event was another huge success, with over 8,000 riders participating 
in the 180 mile bike ride to Austin.  Enron once again had the largest team, 
breaking the national record with over 400 riders.  This year, the MS Society 
expects to set a new fundraising record of over $3 million.  With your 
support, Enron will again be the top fund-raising team with over $350,000 in 
pledges to date.  Rest assured that your money will be put to good use in 
Multiple Sclerosis research as we try to find a cure for this terrible 
disease.  

The conditions were absolutely perfect this past weekend.  The race started 
off at 7am Saturday morning from Tully Stadium in Houston.  Team Enron once 
again had the privilege of starting first in the race.  Things were going 
pretty well for me until mile 6, when another biker veered into my rear 
wheel.  Luckily, I managed not to fall and no one was hurt, but my wheel was 
completely bent.  I eventually found a support vehicle to take me to the 
first rest stop where they could do the repairs.  Unfortunately, it took me 
over 2 hours to get my bike fixed.  So much for the early start!

The rest of the day went smoothly, and I was able to make up most of the time 
I had lost in the morning by riding through the rest stops.  After lunch in 
Bellville, the roads had a few more hills, but the wind was cooperative all 
the way to LaGrange, the midway point of the race.  In LaGrange, Enron 
treated us to massages, a barbeque dinner, and cold beer, all much 
appreciated after 100 miles of riding.  The atmosphere in the camp is a lot 
of fun, with a band playing and riders filtering in all evening long with 
stories about the day's ride.  

The next morning, we got up bright and early at 5am for the MS Society's 
famous pancake breakfast.  We needed the carbohydrates because the second day 
features the infamous Bastrop State Park and its killer hills.  My legs were 
a little stiff the next morning, but after the first few miles I was warmed 
up and ready to go.  I cruised through most of the morning until Bastrop.  
For the record, the hills in the park aren't half as bad as people say.  It's 
actually one of my favorite parts of the ride because it's shaded by trees, 
and you get a lot of momentum going down the hills.  Once we were out of the 
park, lunch was only a few miles away.  I scarfed down some Subway sandwiches 
and brownies, refilled my Camelback, and was ready to go again.  Only 40 
miles left!  

After breezing through the first 20 miles, I started to wear down a little.  
At the same time, the wind picked up, so the last 20 miles were probably the 
toughest part.  When you're that close to the finish line, you have to suck 
it up and keep going.  They post mile markers the last 4 miles, and you can 
feel the anticipation building.  The last mile of the race is packed with 
people on each side cheering you on.  It's quite a rush when you get to the 
end.  Upon arriving in Austin, I checked my bike on the truck back to Houston 
and enjoyed Hooter's chicken sandwiches and pasta salad.  What a ride!

Thanks again for your support.  Just to let you know, I'll be coming around 
next week to collect your pledge.  Your contribution is, of course, fully tax 
deductible.  Enron is also doubling all pledges (the Cycling Club is taking 
care of the paperwork, so no need to fill out a form).  


Hope to see you in the race next year!

Brian

Hey Paul,

I left a msg in your voice mail, but the low down is that the ENE/AC Flag 
Football tourney is Saturday and we would like you to play.  The tourney 
starts at 10 and is 3 hours long.  If we win, we get 16 tickets to the game 
(2 for each of us).  Let me know if you are interested.

Thanks,

I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our 
plays from our flag football league.  There are plays on both tabs.
I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at 
center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at 
blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have 
objections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that 
he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?).

Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let 
me know.

Let me know what you think.

Hook 'Em!

Subject: Re: Wellhead Accrual Income

Melissa,

As you know, as of Jan 01, 2000 the Wellhead Portfolio has been segregated 
from the rest of HPLC's Physical Portfolio.  As a result of this segregation, 
it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly 
"accrual value" can be determined.  This analysis has resulted in the 
realization that the Wellhead Potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of 
accrual value per month.  The main drivers of this accrual value are deals 
that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes 
greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and 
value withheld from MTM because of accrual costs.  Of the above, Greg Sharp 
will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes 
greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked.  Tom will 
keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed 
to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).  The breakout of this 
value has been on average 60% to Greg and 40% to Tom.  The following is a 
breakdown of 1st quarter accrual value.

January-

Total Accrual Value = $266,504

Greg's Value       Tom's Value
Evergreen Value =                         $140,750     Bid to Mid =

Incorrect Marking =                       ($105,000)
Total Value =                                   $148,750

Eric, 

Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
become familiar with this data extraction process. 

Thank you,

accrual income in his financials.  

It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you

this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to

There is not enough data on it to make an educated decision.  It looks like 
they have the backing of an I-bank to place some more stock so that is 
somewhat encouraging.  You are going to have to make your own call on this

Hey,

I tried to call you.  I need Brandi's Work #, Home # and Social Security #.

ETom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value.  
60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly 
basis.  Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.

For example:

Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.

This means that:

Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000
Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000

Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000)
So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense
Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)

Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value
Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been 
previously recognized.
Ed's P&L is net unchanged from all of the above.


Call with questions.

what's up with the migraines? that is two weekends in a row!  the concert was 
good - we left a little bit before the goo goo dolls finished - i got to hear 
black ballon and name - so i was happy.   i felt sick this weekend too - so 
mine was pretty uneventful - i just lounged most of the weekend.  I did get 
to go to a game at my new field (Enron).  It is a great place to see a 
ballgame.  You really can appreciate the difference between Enron Field and 
the Astrodome.

I left early on Friday b/c I am a shooter :)  The Fam is great and Jason has

I don't know the YMCA's policy on rain outs so  I will assume that we still 
have a game tonight.  Our game is at 7:45 tonight.  Please let me know if you 
will be there.


EricThought you might find this interesting!


I will play if the street thug doesn't

I wanted to take a minute to apologize to you guys for the scene at last 
night's game.  I did not do a captain's job of controlling the situation, and 
I am sorry.  That being said, I am writing to determine if we will have a 
team in the next session.  We had previously committed to play, but with 
recent developments, I am not sure if everyone is still interested.  Please 
let me know if you will be interested in playing in the next session because 
I have already told the sportsplex that we will be playing.  If we decide not 
to play, I need to let them know ASAP and try and get the money back(forfeit 
deposit).  It is critical that I get a 100% response to this email to gauge 
whether or not we have enough people.  Due to the increased number of the 
people on the team working in risk, we will need as many bodies as possible 
due to the early games this session(they start this time at 6:30).  The 
season begins next wednesday.

Thanks again for a fun and memorable season and I hope we do it again(at 
least the fun part).  Have a good weekend.

I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our 
plays from our flag football league.  There are plays on both tabs.
I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at 
center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at 
blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have 
objections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that 
he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?).

Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let 
me know.

Let me know what you think.

Hook 'Em!

Subject: FYI -New Product on EOL

Just so everyone is on the same page:

Based on Jennifer and Dale's discussions with Eric Bass, a new "tokenized 
period" will be set up in EOL.  The intent of this period (quick overview) is 
to allow for gas flow Monday through Friday and no flow on the weekends.  
This will generally be traded for in full month or rest of the month 
increments.

It is my understanding the although the trade can be conveyed correctly to 
the customer and priced accordingly using EOL, the trade itself (with 
Multiple Monday - Friday, no flow during weekend periods) cannot be handled 
internally by EOL.  Just as EOL is not able to handle this trade, the Sitara 
bridge from EOL cannot handle this trade.  Because of this, there should be 
heighten attention by Trade Capture given to the EOL Bridge monitor.  These 
trades will error out and will have to be entered manually.

An effort needs to be evaluated and prioritized by both applications (EOL and 
Sitara) on how a deal with multi-periods can flow without human 
intervention.  This has not been started.  In the meantime, a deal of this 
nature will have to be entered manually.

How do I know that a particular deal has multi-period flow?  Once the EOL 
product has been set up, Jennifer and/or Dale will let all involved know.  
The person(s) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what 
is meant by the EOL product's delivery period and enter the deal 
accordingly.  

For example, assume that a deal has been traded for April:

  Four delivery periods (separate lines) should be included in the Sitara 
ticket
  
  Start: 04/03 Stop: 04/07
   04/10  04/14
   04/17  04/21
   04/24  04/28 
  
 Each delivery period (line) should have the same pricing

 Remember to enter the EOL deal number when creating the Sitara trade.

 Also remember that paths created in Unify assume the stop date is open 
ended.  Every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date 
is on the path; otherwise
 the number of reconciling items will increase.

Please forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted.

Any concerns, please contact Sheri Thomas or myself.

SRM (x33548) 
Dale,

Ed Gottlob would like to set up a meeting with all of the necessary 
counterparties in order to discuss this product.  Can you find out when a 
good time would be?


Thanks,

Eric -

Logistics is telling us that this product is not presently traded OTC. The 
Sitara group is telling us that we don't presently have the ability to 
support this product, which is probaby a result of the fact that is is 
unprecedented. 
To my knowledge EOL doesn't have the ability to eliminate specific dates 
between the Start Date and End Date.

David, essentially this product would be a calendar month long US Phys Gas 
contract where we DO NOT move gas on the weekends. 

Can we chat about this please.

Hey!  Did we ever come up with our plans for the week/weekend?  I know that 
you said you were busy Wednesday and Thursday night- so I figured you and I 
would do something Friday night.  Michelle (one of the girls that I work 
with) asked if I wanted to go with her to a crawfish boil Saturday late 
afternoon- but I got the idea that it wasn't a bring a date type thing.  I 
haven't eaten crawfish in an age- so sounded like fun- I know that we don't 
usually so stuff during the day on the weekends- but I wanted to make sure 
that you didn't have anything planned for us to do that afternoon before I 
told her one way or the other.  But- even if I went to the boil- I would be 
back in time to go out later that night.  

Just let me know what you think.  Oh- and I guess since you can't see me 
Wednesday or Thursday- that probably means that you want to see me tonight.

My peice of this, the language component, is easy to do. The trouble comes in 
with logistics. We need to check with the Sitara Group to see if this is 
feasible. In the OTC world it's a lay-up because you can enter the different 
legs into the system and skip the weekends. The issue re: doing this on EOL 
is the ability of the system NOT TO NOMINATE on certain dates.

Scott Mills is out on vacation until Monday and he's the man I have to see. I 
will follow up with him next week.

did you buy any enron in the 60s?Luis,

I haven't heard when the season is supposed to start, but it should be in 
early April.  So, I will try to schedule a practice.

Let me know when you are back.

Eric,

I am finally coming home this weekend (from India).  Doesn't flag football 
start soon??  If so, shouldn't we get a practice together at some point next 
week??

Tim,

I can only imagine your excitement w/ LSU and the fact that for one day and 
until your team is eliminated, you are the superior school.  I havent seen 
one minute of one game so your picture was what I had in my mind from what my 
friends told me.  I also know that my tournament brackets are fucked up and 
absurdly low.

OK- Would I have asked you if I didn't want you to go??  Just like a woman.

 In all honesty- if you don't want to go- I probably won't go either.  I am 
not a huge professional baseball fan- it is so slow!-  so to go to something 
like that I really need to enjoy the people that I am with.  Don't think that 
the tax department necessarily falls into that category- but would be 
bareable if you were there. Just a side thought- but my dad would be so mad 
if he knew I had the opportunity to go- but didn't.  Don't know why that just 
popped in my head.  I guess I write e-mails using "stream of consciousness" 
also.

Also- you know- you and Jennifer are a lot alike.  You know how you send me 
ugly e-mails when you are the last person on any group e-mail that I send 
out.  Well- she is even worse- she just called and yelled at me- b/c she was 
not the FIRST person on a group e-mail that I sent.

I'm sorry, I forgot that you were clairvoyant.  I don't think you can make a

saying that Enron's stock is trading at 70 why don't I buy it for 80 b/c I am 
confident that it is going to 90.

That's real smart.  No wonder EES loses money!

Happy St. Patrick's Day!
I'm moving this weekend to another apartment in the same complex.  We're
overlooking the pool now, so stop by and visit.  I've attached the new
address.  Phone numbers will remain the same.

Things here in Houston are going well.  I'm going to Eastern Europe March
29-April 11.  The tentative schedule is Budapest, Prague, Munich, Salzberg,
Vienna, and Marseille.  The weekend after I get back is the MS-150 bike ride

from Houston to Austin, so wish me luck!


Hope all's well,
Brian

Market deals are only captured in accrual value calculations if they are in 
the wellhead portfolio.  I do not recall any sales currently in the wellhead 
portfolio.  However, I do not see a problem with the market deals unless they 
were marked improperly (e.g. accrual adders).

Subject: Market Meters Breakout

Brenda,

I am going through the market meters right now and am finding the following 
results for February.

TOM $124,002
GREG      $9,285

I started the process by pulling all the meters and associated transport 
rates off the transport capacity tickets.  I pulled them based on the 
delivery rates being greater than the matrix.  I then researched the deals to 
pull the deal tickets.  If the deal occurred before 7/99, then I assigned the 
expense to Tom.  If the deal occurred after 7/99, then I looked at who the 
dealmaker was and based the assignment of the transport expense on who the 
dealmaker was.  In all cases, either Papayoti or Lamphier did the deal.

I also trued up the transport rate to the transport rate on the deal ticket.  
This includes occasions when the transport capacity ticket did not have a 
transport rate but the transport capacity ticket had an increased rate.  In 
other words, I defaulted to the deal ticket so that we could have a paper 
record of the transport rate.

As of now, I still have to pull January volume and attach the rate to the 
March transport.  I wanted to go through the full analysis first and now that 
I have the actual transport rate from the deal ticket, I know which rate to 
attach.

I will pursue these avenues next.  Please let me know what questions you have.


Heidi

PS Details are attached.




Here is my bracket.  I will bring the money down around 10:30.
When is graduation?  And, of course I will show up.  Although, if I recall, 
you didn't show up for mine!
You can send the announcement to 2512 Milam St. #5216, 77006.
I haven't heard of the advertising firm.  What kind of projects do they work 
on?   I am going to Earth Day. Are you?  Are you bringing Rebecca again this 
year? 
We will probably go out to Kenneally's, Griff's or Birraporetti's for St. 
Patty's day.  What about you?

Eric, I am checking the process now for incorporating all transport revenue 
due Ed for delivery meters in the Texas region.  The following meters have 
transport rates attached to them which are above and beyond the matrix rates 
Ed quotes to Tom.  I believe that we are already capturing all Ed's 
revenue/Tom's expense for this gas at these meters, but want to be sure of 
that.   Would you let me know if these are the meters for which we are 
manually moving around money from Tom to Ed for the residential portion of 
the Lufkin-Diboll volume?



I believe that the industrial portion of this volume is included already as 
part of Ducote's deal, and I believe that the residential portion is volume 
which you determine and then move from Tom to Ed every month.

Is this right?


Heidi

lets make it worthwhile - how about $500?

$50 straight up-no points.  And I don't want to hear any crying that you're 
seeded lower.  If you're as good as you think and your conference is that 
much better, you hould have no worries.

be Woodrow Wilson.  Now, if you all are the reasonably intelligent 
individuals I believe you to be you will have already guessed where I'm going 
with this...  Anyway, given the impending heat wave that will soon be 
striking our fair city, it is my recommendation that we take this opportunity 
to enjoy one more pleasant evening on Woody's deck.  Same Bat time, same Bat

Ok- I'm getting pissed off.  I came in today to work on a project- only to 
find out that my tax application is not set up to do what I need to do.  So- 
basically i can't even start on this until someone from out support team can 
come look at it- and you just don't understand- with our support team- that 
could take a day or two.  See that is the problem here- in EVERY person that 
I have worked with at Enron- NO ONE ever thinks ahead.  No one is a planner.  
Like- I am new in this group- why did no one consider the fact that I 
wouldn't have this on my desktop- and that it would take a while to get it- 
especially on a Friday- when half our staff is gone- b/c it is  THEIR Friday 
off!  

I'm leaving at noon- and I'm not coming back- I don't care if the application 
is fixed or not.  The other lady in our group- that today is her Friday off- 
she isn't coming in.  See I am getting tired of the fact- that they treat 
their rotators like interms around here.  That is basically what is pissing 
me off.  You get all the shit work- that no one else wants to do.  You are 
totally left out of the loop- like why wasn't I told b/4 6 o'clock last 
night- that this needed to be done.  No respect and poor planning.  Very 
dangerous combination.  And I'm tired of it .  It is quickly approaching the 
time to find a new profession.  

OK- enough venting for this morning.  Sorry- I am sure I will be in a much 
better mood when I see you tonight

                Too often, we lose sight of life's simple pleasures.
                Remember, when someone annoys you it takes 42
                muscles in your face to frown BUT, it only takes 4
                muscles to extend your arm and bitch-slap the
                mother fucker upside the head...

Subject: Practice - TONIGHT


Practice is absolutely necessary to assure our victory.    So we will have 
several practices this week  (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday... with no 
drinking and a curfew on Friday) and may cancel the scrimmage to schedule in 
more practices.

We will have a practice tonight at 7pm at Memorial Park.   Let me know if you 
can make it.   ext. 37842.


IF you were at last year's scrimmage with the aggie team, this will be at the 
same location.   Hopefully, the lights will be on and the fields will be 
clear.   If it is raining,  the practise will be canceled.


From downtown, heading West toward 610 on Memorial,   goto Memorial Park and 
make a right at the first light.  Take this road up till you see a softball 
and soccer field on your right hand side.  This is where we will practice.   
Eric please bring a couple of footballs.



If you  goto far, further up the road you will see the golf course on your 
left hand side as well as Beck's Prime, etc.



----

Also, Sarah, please bring Gerald to the game.  He helped greatly last year, 
and a stand by would be excellent in the event of injury.

Do I have a Login ID and Password?

Thanks.

Subject: Friday State of the Union

Its been a crazy February!  So many things and PEOPLE to talk about and only 
one Friday State of the Union to cover it all.  Everyone just relax because 
its going to be a long one.  As Always, Brace Yourself.

Where to begin?  How about those Tigers?  They are on track to be the SEC 
West Basketball Champions.  Who would have thought it? Kristin, my younger 
sister who is a freshman, says LSU is like "Spring Break Everyday!"  That's 
great!  I'm sure the students at Harvard say the same thing when their teams 
are on a winning streak.  Geaux Tigers!

Forget Engagements how about Shot-Gun Weddings!  I recently learned that, 
while making a weekend trip to New Orleans, my high school sweet heart, 
Sarah, got "Tanked" in the French Quarter and found herself in the middle of 
the Pat O Brian's  Piano Bar in front of a minister saying "I DO" to her 
boyfriend, now husband, Brandt.  On such short notice, they were unable to 
find a reception hall to celebrate the wedding, so the family just celebrated 
all night at Dante's Pizza.  I hear it was one hell of a party.  
Congratulations Sarah!

Speaking of good parties, the DC Mardi Gras Balls were incredible.  I'd like 
to take this time to once again thank my buddy, Chris, for taking me and 
Kenny K with him.  If you enjoy Politics like I do, its a must see event.  
The two things that stick mostly in my mind are:  The last night of the ball 
after several cocktails, Granola Centola staggering over to Senator Mary 
Landrieu and saying,"Mrs. Clinton, will you dance with me to New Orleans 
Lady?"  That Larry, he's paving the path for his political future------a 
regular James Carville!  I also had the opportunity to ask the ever-so-shy 
Edwin Edwards a question - "Governor who do you like in the President's 
Race?"  He responded, "Have the odds come out already?!?"  No doubt a man of 
true character.

I hear times are tough for my friends down in Shreveport.  Brandon, a full 
time med school student, has been moonlighting during his free time.  He 
decided to put his "Three on the top, two on the sides, don't touch the back, 
Jack, haircut " to work on the Internet.  He's currently modelling his sweet 
hair style as "Mullet of the Week"  at http://www.mulletsgalore.com/ .  He 
gets 50 cents every time the site is hit, so take the time and visit the site 
to help an aspiring doctor.

February was a good month and things are pretty good at the homefront.  I 
still haven't found the girl of my dreams, but neither has my roommate, 
Matt.  Although the chances of him finding one before me are pretty good 
considering all he's looking for is, and I quote, "A girl who is pretty and 
who thinks I am smart just because I read the newspaper."   
ICE---ICE---BABY---TOO COLD---TOO COLD!

Everyone have a great weekend!

CKL

Subject: Re: Friday State of the Union  

hey everyone it is you lucky day!  i forgot to put a few things into my 
famous friday state of the union.  first, i have picked up cooking recently.  
i am a regular emeril.  for my roommate matt's b-day i decided to make him an 
ice cream cake.  it looked so delicious.  i used cookie dough ice cream with 
an oreo cookies crust and whip cream.  for flavor i added two sticks of 
butter (the recipe calls for zero).  it looked so good that i ate it all 
before matt got home.  lucky for me matt came home in time to give me the 
hymlec's because i was choking to death on a stick of butter.  i am 
dissapointed though because i spilled ice cream all over my shirt and matt's 
carpet.  if anyone needs the recipe please call.

i did have a date this week with some girl (we will call her X).  we went to 
dinner and had appetizers, main course, desert and wine.  well, i had wine.  
we then went to my favorite bar.  i got a little buzzed so i let her drive my 
car.  X got made because i took a nap on the way home and she had to potato 
sack me into the house.  why do they call it "landry loaded"?

i have been working out lately.  my friends still like to call me dough boy.  
i think they are jealous that i am so carved up.  god i am tan!

keep in touch

ckl 

ps-  please foward to our friends not on the distribution who would love to 
read my state of the union
Don't get testy. I wasn't trying to get you upset.  I thought we were having 
a normal conversation.  It just didn't seem like you were talking as much as 
usual.

Eric,

Could you find some time to look at the new Southern Union contract for 
Galveston and Port Arthur?  Pricings are wrong in Sitara so my system 
invoices are being understated/overstated each month.

If you want, we could sit down and go over it to see what needs to be done.  

Let me know.

Thanks.

Subject: CP&L Requests - Jan '00

Eric;

Two requests for the current Central Power & Light contract 96022030 - Sitara 
Deal 92399:

1.  For January 2000 volumes, we need a deficiency charge added in the amount 
of 12,231.85.

2.  For the entire length / term of this deal, the second step of the tiers 
or NNQ should have the rate handle associated with Gas Daily Houston Ship 
Channel HIGH for the day delivered less one cent.   This is per the 
confirmation Contract Price item 2.  The dollar impact for the incorrect use 
of the MID rate for Jan '00 is 6,395.23.  This same change in the rate handle 
should be made retroactively to November '99 and proactively through October 
'00.

Total dollar impact for January '00 = 18,627.08  added revenue.

Attached is the Jan worksheet.  Questions or comments, please let me know.

Hollis 3.7136



This is strictly for the Intramonth P&L, correct?

Dan,

Sorry to keep bothering you, but does what we talked about earlier pertain to 
EOL trades as well given the language in those contracts, i.e. requiring 
outside parties to honor contracts if they claim "force majeure"?

        Winning the Cultural War by Charlton Heston

Note from Bill Koenig:

Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard.
Rush Limbaugh today said he has received 9000 e-mail requests for a
copy.

It is entitled 'Winning the Cultural War' and was given at the
Harvard Law School Forum, February 16, 1999.

************

I remember my son when he was 5, explaining to his kindergarten
class what his father did for a living. "My Daddy," he said,
"pretends to be people." There have been quite a few of them.
Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple of
Christian saints, generals of various nationalities and different
centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French
cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want the
ceiling re-painted I'll do my best. There always seem to be a lot
of different fellows up here. I'm never sure which one of them gets
to talk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.

As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave me
the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those
great men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect you
with your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom of
thought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating the
memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, "We are
now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long
endure." Those words are true again. I believe that we are again
engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that's about to
hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart.
I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside
you ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into
the miracle that it is.

Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National
Rifle Association, which protects the right to keep and
bear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I
serve as a moving target for the media who've called me
everything from "ridiculous" and "duped" to a "brain-injured,
senile, crazy old man." I know ... I'm pretty old ... but I sure
thank the Lord ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs of
those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that
firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger than
that. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across
our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable
thoughts and speech are mandated.

For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 --
long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an
audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride
or red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.

I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But
when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no
further than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.

I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a
speech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews
and singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.

Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my
country. But when I asked an audience to oppose this
cultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.

>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially
saying, "Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You are
using language not authorized for public consumption!"

But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in political
correctness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to the

British crown.

In his book, "The End of Sanity," Martin Gross writes that
"blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the
norm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be new
customs, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly
foisted on us from every direction.

Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something,
without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mind
mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right
from wrong. And they don't like it."

Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men
seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each
step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ...
all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In New
Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had
been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the
state commissioner announced that health providers who are
HIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients that
they are infected.

At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the
school team "The Tribe" because it was supposedly insulting
to local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs
truly like the name.

In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the
rights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for
transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing
sex change surgery.

In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been
placed in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in
Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At the
University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died
at Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college
officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students.
Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said "Negroes."
Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said "black." But it's a
no-no now.

For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly
"Native-American." I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I also
happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. On
my wife's side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American
... with a capital letter on "American." Finally, just last month
... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of Public
Advocate, used the word "niggardly" while talking to colleagues
about budgetary matters. Of course, 'niggardly' means stingy or
scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and
resign.

As columnist Tony Snow wrote: "David Howard got fired because some
people in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaning
of 'niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover
the meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for their
ignorance." What does all of this mean? It means that telling us
what to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so telling
us what to do can't be far behind.

Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did
political correctness originate on America's campuses?
And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed
to debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?

Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they
really believe? It scares me to death, and should scare
you too, that the superstition of political correctness rules the
halls of reason.

You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle
of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the
Charles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and your
counterparts across the land, are the most socially
conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.

And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-by
your grandfathers' standards-cowards.

Here's another example. Right now at more than one major
university, Second Amendment scholars and researchers are
being told to shut up about their findings or they'll lose their
jobs. Why? Because their research findings would undermine
big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of
millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.

I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked
at that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw
material of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the core
value of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thought
and expression lay down your arms and plead, "Don't shoot me." If
you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you
see distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a
sexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does not
make you anti-religion. If you accept but don't celebrate
homosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.

Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators
for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do?
How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?

The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.,
standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand
people. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of
course. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think or
what to say or how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocol
that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.

I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who
learned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great
man who led those in the right against those with the might.

Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that
Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sent
Thoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, that
protested a war in Vietnam.

In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural
correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, social
directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.

But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you put
yourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You must
be willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalent
of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma.
You must be willing to experience discomfort. I'm not Complaining,
but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me.
Let me tell you a story.

A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was selling
a CD called "Cop Killer" celebrating ambushing and
murdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other than
Time/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.
Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one
had been murdered. But Time/Warner was
stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media
were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.

I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly
Hills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.
What I did there was against the advice of my family and
colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a
thousand average American stockholders, I simply read the full
lyrics of "Cop Killer"-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.

"I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF
I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF
I'm ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF
I'm ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF..."

It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But
trust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched
faces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs and
stared at their shoes. They hated me for that.

Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist
filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old
nieces of Al and Tipper Gore. "SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ...."

Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I
left the room in echoing silence.

When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said
"We can't print that." "I know," I replied, "but Time/Warner _s
selling it."

Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll
never be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review from
Time magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act,
not just talk.

When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam
the switchboard of the district attorney's office. When your
university is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of the
students graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of
regents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the
playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment
...march on that school and block its doorways.

When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays
you ... petition them, oust them, banish them. When
Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy
Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott
their magazine and the products it advertises.

So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in the
hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that
freed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the
hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, by
God's grace, built this country.

If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.

Thank you.

case for my friend Sarah, who recently moved to Telluride from the Caribbea=
n.=20
She and her daughters arrived late this summer, and when the snows began to=

        Winning the Cultural War by Charlton Heston
   Date:
        Tue, 16 Mar 1999 20:47:56 -0600

Note from Bill Koenig:

Below is an excellent message given by Charlton Heston at Harvard.
Rush Limbaugh today said he has received 9000 e-mail requests for a
copy.

It is entitled 'Winning the Cultural War' and was given at the
Harvard Law School Forum, February 16, 1999.

************

I remember my son when he was 5, explaining to his kindergarten
class what his father did for a living. "My Daddy," he said,
"pretends to be people." There have been quite a few of them.
Prophets from the Old and New Testaments, a couple of
Christian saints, generals of various nationalities and different
centuries, several kings, three American presidents, a French
cardinal and two geniuses, including Michelangelo. If you want the
ceiling re-painted I'll do my best. There always seem to be a lot
of different fellows up here. I'm never sure which one of them gets
to talk. Right now, I guess I'm the guy.

As I pondered our visit tonight it struck me: If my creator gave me
the gift to connect you with the hearts and minds of those
great men, then I want to use that same gift now to re-connect you
with your own sense of liberty ... your own freedom of
thought ... your own compass for what is right. Dedicating the
memorial at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln said of America, "We are
now engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether this nation or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long
endure." Those words are true again. I believe that we are again
engaged in a great civil war, a cultural war that's about to
hijack your birthright to think and say what resides in your heart.
I fear you no longer trust the pulsing lifeblood of liberty inside
you ... the stuff that made this country rise from wilderness into
the miracle that it is.

Let me back up. About a year ago I became president of the National
Rifle Association, which protects the right to keep and
bear arms. I ran for office, I was elected, and now I serve ... I
serve as a moving target for the media who've called me
everything from "ridiculous" and "duped" to a "brain-injured,
senile, crazy old man." I know ... I'm pretty old ... but I sure
thank the Lord ain't senile. As I have stood in the crosshairs of
those who target Second Amendment freedoms, I've realized that
firearms are not the only issue. No, it's much, much bigger than
that. I've come to understand that a cultural war is raging across
our land, in which, with Orwellian fervor, certain acceptable
thoughts and speech are mandated.

For example, I marched for civil rights with Dr. King in 1963 --
long before Hollywood found it fashionable. But when I told an
audience last year that white pride is just as valid as black pride
or red pride or anyone else's pride, they called me a racist.

I've worked with brilliantly talented homosexuals all my life. But
when I told an audience that gay rights should extend no
further than your rights or my rights, I was called a homophobe.

I served in World War II against the Axis powers. But during a
speech, when I drew an analogy between singling out innocent Jews
and singling out innocent gun owners, I was called an anti-Semite.

Everyone I know knows I would never raise a closed fist against my
country. But when I asked an audience to oppose this
cultural persecution, I was compared to Timothy McVeigh.

>From Time magazine to friends and colleagues, they're essentially
saying, "Chuck, how dare you speak your mind. You are
using language not authorized for public consumption!"

But I am not afraid. If Americans believed in political
correctness, we'd still be King George's boys-subjects bound to the

British crown.

In his book, "The End of Sanity," Martin Gross writes that
"blatantly irrational behavior is rapidly being established as the
norm in almost every area of human endeavor. There seem to be new
customs, new rules, new anti-intellectual theories regularly
foisted on us from every direction.

Underneath, the nation is roiling. Americans know something,
without a name is undermining the nation, turning the mind
mushy when it comes to separating truth from falsehood and right
from wrong. And they don't like it."

Let me read a few examples. At Antioch college in Ohio, young men
seeking intimacy with a coed must get verbal permission at each
step of the process from kissing to petting to final copulation ...
all clearly spelled out in a printed college directive. In New
Jersey, despite the death of several patients nationwide who had
been infected by dentists who had concealed their AIDS --- the
state commissioner announced that health providers who are
HIV-positive need not. .. need not ... tell their patients that
they are infected.

At William and Mary, students tried to change the name of the
school team "The Tribe" because it was supposedly insulting
to local Indians, only to learn that authentic Virginia chiefs
truly like the name.

In San Francisco, city fathers passed an ordinance protecting the
rights of transvestites to cross-dress on the job, and for
transsexuals to have separate toilet facilities while undergoing
sex change surgery.

In New York City, kids who don't speak a word of Spanish have been
placed in bilingual classes to learn their three R's in
Spanish solely because their last names sound Hispanic. At the
University of Pennsylvania, in a state where thousands died
at Gettysburg opposing slavery, the president of that college
officially set up segregated dormitory space for black students.
Yeah, I know ... that's out of bounds now. Dr. King said "Negroes."
Jimmy Baldwin and most of us on the March said "black." But it's a
no-no now.

For me, hyphenated identities are awkward ... particularly
"Native-American." I'm a Native American, for God's sake. I also
happen to be a blood-initiated brother of the Miniconjou Sioux. On
my wife's side, my grandson is a 13th-generation Native American
... with a capital letter on "American." Finally, just last month
... David Howard, head of the Washington D.C. Office of Public
Advocate, used the word "niggardly" while talking to colleagues
about budgetary matters. Of course, 'niggardly' means stingy or
scanty. But within days Howard was forced to publicly apologize and
resign.

As columnist Tony Snow wrote: "David Howard got fired because some
people in public employ were morons who (a) didn't know the meaning
of 'niggardly,' (b) didn't know how to use a dictionary to discover
the meaning, and ,actually demanded that he apologize for their
ignorance." What does all of this mean? It means that telling us
what to think has evolved into telling us what to say, so telling
us what to do can't be far behind.

Before you claim to be a champion of free thought, tell me: Why did
political correctness originate on America's campuses?
And why do you continue to tolerate it? Why do you, who're supposed
to debate ideas, surrender to their suppression?

Let's be honest. Who here thinks your professors can say what they
really believe? It scares me to death, and should scare
you too, that the superstition of political correctness rules the
halls of reason.

You are the best and the brightest. You, here in the fertile cradle
of American academia, here in the castle of learning on the
Charles River, you are the cream. But I submit that you, and your
counterparts across the land, are the most socially
conformed and politically silenced generation since Concord Bridge.

And as long as you validate that ... and abide it ... you are-by
your grandfathers' standards-cowards.

Here's another example. Right now at more than one major
university, Second Amendment scholars and researchers are
being told to shut up about their findings or they'll lose their
jobs. Why? Because their research findings would undermine
big-city mayor's pending lawsuits that seek to extort hundreds of
millions of dollars from firearm manufacturers.

I don't care what you think about guns. But if you are not shocked
at that, I am shocked at you. Who will guard the raw
material of unfettered ideas, if not you? Who will defend the core
value of academia, if you supposed soldiers of free thought
and expression lay down your arms and plead, "Don't shoot me." If
you talk about race, it does not make you a racist. If you
see distinctions between the genders, it does not make you a
sexist. If you think critically about a denomination, it does not
make you anti-religion. If you accept but don't celebrate
homosexuality, it does not make you a homophobe.

Don't let America's universities continue to serve as incubators
for this rampant epidemic of new McCarthyism. But what can you do?
How can anyone prevail against such pervasive social subjugation?

The answer's been here all along. I learned it 36 years ago, on the
steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington D.C.,
standing with Dr. Martin Luther King and two hundred thousand
people. You simply ... disobey. Peaceably, yes. Respectfully, of
course. Nonviolently, absolutely. But when told how to think or
what to say or how to behave, we don't. We disobey social protocol
that stifles and stigmatizes personal freedom.

I learned the awesome power of disobedience from Dr. King ... who
learned it from Gandhi, and Thoreau and Jesus and every other great
man who led those in the right against those with the might.

Disobedience is in our DNA. We feel innate kinship with that
Disobedient spirit that tossed tea into Boston Harbor, that sent
Thoreau to jail, that refused to sit in the back of the bus, that
protested a war in Vietnam.

In that same spirit, I am asking you to disavow cultural
correctness with massive disobedience of rogue authority, social
directives and onerous law that weaken personal freedom.

But be careful ... it hurts. Disobedience demands that you put
yourself at risk. Dr. King stood on lots of balconies. You must
be willing to be humiliated ... to endure the modern-day equivalent
of the police dogs at Montgomery and the water Cannons at Selma.
You must be willing to experience discomfort. I'm not Complaining,
but my own decades of social activism have taken their toll on me.
Let me tell you a story.

A few years back I heard about a rapper named Ice-T who was selling
a CD called "Cop Killer" celebrating ambushing and
murdering police officers. It was being marketed by none other than
Time/Warner, the biggest entertainment conglomerate in the world.
Police across the country were outraged. Rightfully so-at least one
had been murdered. But Time/Warner was
stonewalling because the CD was a cash cow for them, and the media
were tiptoeing around it because the rapper was black.

I heard Time/Warner had a stockholders meeting scheduled in Beverly
Hills. I owned some shares at the time, so I decided to attend.
What I did there was against the advice of my family and
colleagues. I asked for the floor. To a hushed room of a
thousand average American stockholders, I simply read the full
lyrics of "Cop Killer"-every vicious, vulgar, instructional word.

"I GOT MY 12 GAUGE SAWED OFF
I GOT MY HEADLIGHTS TURNED OFF
I'm ABOUT TO BUST SOME SHOTS OFF
I'm ABOUT TO DUST SOME COPS OFF..."

It got worse, a lot worse. I won't read the rest of it to you. But
trust me, the room was a sea of shocked, frozen, blanched
faces. The Time/Warner executives squirmed in their chairs and
stared at their shoes. They hated me for that.

Then I delivered another volley of sick lyric brimming with racist
filth, where Ice-T fantasizes about sodomizing two 12-year old
nieces of Al and Tipper Gore. "SHE PUSHED HER BUTT AGAINST MY ...."

Well, I won't do to you here what I did to them. Let's just say I
left the room in echoing silence.

When I read the lyrics to the waiting press corps, one of them said
"We can't print that." "I know," I replied, "but Time/Warner _s
selling it."

Two months later, Time/Warner terminated Ice-T's contract. I'll
never be offered another film by Warners, or get a good review from
Time magazine. But disobedience means you must be willing to act,
not just talk.

When a mugger sues his elderly victim for defending herself ... jam
the switchboard of the district attorney's office. When your
university is pressured to lower standards until 80 percent of the
students graduate with honors ... choke the halls of the board of
regents. When an 8-year-old boy pecks a girl's cheek on the
playground and gets hauled into court for sexual harassment
...march on that school and block its doorways.

When someone you elected is seduced by political power and betrays
you ... petition them, oust them, banish them. When
Time magazine's cover portrays millennium nuts as deranged, crazy
Christians holding a cross as it did last month ... boycott
their magazine and the products it advertises.

So that this nation may long endure, I urge you to follow in the
hallowed footsteps of the great disobediences of history that
freed exiles, founded religions, defeated tyrants, and yes, in the
hands of an aroused rabble in arms and a few great men, by
God's grace, built this country.

If Dr. King were here, I think he would agree.

Thank you.

i had a really fun weekend.  we went to chuy's and gallant knight on friday,

about 20-25 people showed up to the party, so it was a fairly big success.  
of course, you didn't show up so it wasn't as successful as it could have 
been.

how was yours?

I need to know who of you is interested in playing in a flag football league 
starting in March.  This is a reunion tour of our glorious victory in the 
Enron tournament.

-Ericthanks for showing up to the party on sunday.  your new name backout 
ballases!You may notice that 9911 PMA's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final 
P&L.  You will also notice that the detail following the majority of the 
adjustments is Unaccounted For Gas.  At the close of business for the 991 
P&L, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in UA4.  We 
thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to 
offset the PMA's we would take as a result of this UA4 blowout.  Therefore, 
the net impact of 9911 PMA's is $41,119 or 2% of last day P&L.

I just wanted to congratulate the team on a great P&L for the month of 
November.

-EricIs Hill available for trade?  Let me know what on my team interests you.

-Eric10Could you please schedule a meeting for Wednesday, Thurs, or Friday with the 
usual parties?  

Thanks,

This is special advanced notice for people who have kids or like to plan 
things in advance.  I'll resend out the week of the party.
********
You are all cordially invited to attend the following engagement.  Please 
bring friends and forward this to anyone I may have missed accidentally.

When: Saturday, January 29th-NEXT WEEKEND, not this Weekend.. no one will be 
there!

What:  6th annual John, Robert & Mo's Party (just 5th annual for me).  2kegs, 
assorted mixed beverages, and mystery snacks will be on hand.

Where: 6422 Wister Ln, 77008 713-869-6312, map below.

j:a5hzz0uw2

Time: Whenever till Whenever.

Why:  Why not.

Here is a friendly disclaimer from one of our hosts:

You all know what this is about! Let's set aside this evening to hearken back 
to our younger days... when peer pressure was still cool. Experienced 
IDHAFR's can attest, this is no "Company Cocktail Buffet". IDHAFR newbies 
will just have to take our word for it. Last year I said, "we'll see what new 
lows we can achieve"... Little did I know!!!!!  Dolls in the freezer, RIVER 
DANCING... ON THE FURNITURE (picture my head held in shame). I will make no 
such prediction this year. I can't even promise that there will be a Man in 
Black. But I can promise you'll be sorry you missed it!

We hope this notice finds everyone in good health and spirits this new 
millennium (actually that's still a year away but...) So mark your calendar: 
(Out of town guests are surely welcome, sleeping (?) arrangements can always 
be found. Although I must say I didn't like having to share the space under 
the pool table in '96!)

You will probably have to park far away.  Neighbors are pretty friendly. 







I think we are staying in tonight.  I don't know of any big plans.

Our game this week  is at 8:00. Let me know if you can make it.

June-August were incorrect in Sitara.  I have made the necessary 
adjustments.  Stephanie will have to reissue payments.  By my calculations, 
Cabot owes HPL $16,050.

6/99    5000     $2.09      $2.20      $ (16,500)     This Should be Sharp's 
expense as this was pre-merger.
7/99    5000     $2.14      $2.20      $ (9,300)        This Should be the 
desk's

Stephanie, 

The deal ticket that Eric mentions below that changed the tiered pricing is 
EW5406.1 (which fixes the price to $2.35 from 6/1/99-9/30/99).

I was wondering if you showed price adjustments to June-August, in addition 
to September (since this ticket affects all months). 

Let me know, and then I'll call Laurie Clarkson with Cabot Oil & Gas and ask 
her to run this past her trader (Kent Beard) and make sure we are all on the 
same page.

Thanks,

Eric, 

Can you please help per Stephanie's note below.  The audit record shows that 
you changed the tiered pricing on this Cabot deal for 9/99.  Both Stephanie 
and myself thought that Cabot and HPL were in agreement on these prices for 
September.  Can you provide insight into why the tiers were changed for this 
month?

Thank you,

Melissa, 

Someone has changed one of the price tiers on Cabot for 9/99 production.  Due 
to the price change, it is now showing that I need to take a credit of $ 
52,996.72 from Cabot.  Is this correct or not????  I thought we had figured 
the pricing out for 9/99 and Cabot had also agreed.  Please let me know if 
the price change is correct or not, and if I need to take this credit from 
Cabot.  See below the change that was made in Sitara and I am also showing 
what we paid versus what is now showing up in the system.

Subject: Astros Tickets

I am buying Astros/Yankees (Thurs. 3/30, Fri. 3/31) tickets at 9 AM 
Saturday.  These are the first 2 games at the new stadium and I'm buying the 
best available tickets to both games.  The maximum tickets allowed are 
8/person.  Anybody in?

It looks like facility charges are covered 1/2000 forward by the individual 
deals.  Mick does not think there are any other outstanding issues for 
transport as a methodology has been established and agreed upon for 1/2000 
forward.

Eric, 

Can you please help per Stephanie's note below.  The audit record shows that 
you changed the tiered pricing on this Cabot deal for 9/99.  Both Stephanie 
and myself thought that Cabot and HPL were in agreement on these prices for 
September.  Can you provide insight into why the tiers were changed for this 
month?

Thank you,

Melissa, 

Someone has changed one of the price tiers on Cabot for 9/99 production.  Due 
to the price change, it is now showing that I need to take a credit of $ 
52,996.72 from Cabot.  Is this correct or not????  I thought we had figured 
the pricing out for 9/99 and Cabot had also agreed.  Please let me know if 
the price change is correct or not, and if I need to take this credit from 
Cabot.  See below the change that was made in Sitara and I am also showing 
what we paid versus what is now showing up in the system.

Try this out.  It is a questionaire that tells you what kind of dog you are. 
I am a basset hound.
We have actually already called Springer to get on his "Surprise, I'm dating 
your brother" episode.  It's a pretty good deal b/c you get an all expense 
paid trip to Chicago for the weekend.  

I am actually a multimillionare now - I'm thinking about buying that new 
car.  Do you want one?
There is not much going on this weekend on my end - I will probably take it 
easy.  And you?  Let me guess - you are going to try and stop by my place 
(that will happen)?

If Jan is up to ($4.24 mm), have Nov and Dec changed, also? You mentioned

Yes, but I would say that the $200,000/mo during the winter is related to an 
HPL discount on Transport given to the marketing desk in order to make the 
deal more economical.

Bass, is this accurate?

Ed asked me to find revenue from Entex for transportation expense to 
Lufkin/Diboll for the residential part of the contract (Transaction 10).  
After checking into it, we have all found the following things:

1. Howard allocates the Lufkin/Diboll meters (7107/8/9) based on actuals.
2. Howard receives allocations from Entex for the industrial volumes, and 
then backs into the Transaction 10 (residential) volumes for Lufkin/Diboll.
3. Howard allocates the residential piece for Lufkin/Diboll to Transaction 10.
4. Kyle bills Entex for the residential volume, and applies the cash to the 
sales invoice.
5. Cassandra cuts an invoice to Co. 16 to get reimbursed for the transport 
expense going up to Lufkin/Diboll for the residential volume.
6. Eric tells Mick how much expense Tom is including in his P&L for this 
transportation, and Mick includes it in Ed's P&L as revenue from the 
Marketing   Desk.
7. Phillip does manual G/L entries to show an expense to Tom and a revenue to 
Ed for the same amount .
8. This revenue shows up en masse with all of the other revenue from the 
marketing desk in Ed's P&L.

The total revenue for Ed for this portion is about $6,000 per month.  Eric 
says, too, that Ed shows revenue during the winter months for transport for 
Entex of about $200,000 per month from the marketing desk.  This comes from 
money reserved to manage the Entex deal.


Your list of items is correct.  However, the entex related transport shows up 
on the P&L and the GL via transport expense from Tom to Ed.  This number is 
manually booked to the GL each month by Phillip.  Therefore, this revenue 
shows up en masse with all of the marketing desk's expense.

Subject: Entex Transport Reimbursement

Eric and Mick, does this match your understanding of how the money for 
transport related to the volumes that Entex pulls for Lufkin/Diboll 
residential volumes end up in Ed's P&L?  Also, do we do anything for the 
industrial volume?  I think we ought to let people know that we accomplished 
this (albeit that we did this a long time ago).  Please let me know.

Ed asked me to find revenue from Entex for transportation expense to 
Lufkin/Diboll for the residential part of the contract (Transaction 10).  
After checking into it, we have all found the following things:

1. Howard allocates the Lufkin/Diboll meters (7107/8/9) based on actuals.
2. Howard receives allocations from Entex for the industrial volumes, and 
then backs into the Transaction 10 (residential) volumes for Lufkin/Diboll.
3. Howard allocates the residential piece for Lufkin/Diboll to Transaction 10.
4. Kyle bills Entex for the residential volume, and applies the cash to the 
sales invoice.
5. Cassandra cuts an invoice to Co. 16 to get reimbursed for the transport 
expense going up to Lufkin/Diboll for the residential volume.
6. The money lands in Ed's P&L for the residential piece of the transport 
reimbursement.

Right now, at the end of the month, Eric Bass tells Mick how much the 
transport reimbursement is and Mick includes that money in Ed's P&L as 
revenue from a third party.  The actual money is reflected in Co. 12, and we 
just have to make sure that the money is reflected as revenue for Ed in the 
G/L rather than for Tom.

I'm old now, but i can always find solace in the fact that you are older!  I 
don't know yet if I am going to go out tonight, but if I do we'll probably go 
to Woody's on Richmond - it used to be the velvet Elvis

Subject: Reliant Energy - Entex Transport Imbalance


Howard,
This memo is regarding the 91,297 MMBtu imbalance that was created in April 
of 1999 on 
transport contract #012-41991-02-004. The transport delivery off HPLC was 
shorted to keep
Entex whole on a minimum purchase from ENA. Originally this transport 
imbalance was to be cleared
the next month in May of 1999. Some of the imbalance was cleared in May of 
1999, but 91,297 MMBtu
still remains as a imbalance on this contract. We need to monitor the IFHSC 
Index for the upcoming months
so that when one is compatible with the IFHSC Index of April of 1999 we can 
clear this imbalance. We will
need to allocated 91,297 MMBtu extra to the transport. This will reduce the 
purchase from ENA by 91,297 
MMBtu for that month.  I need you to watch over whoever is doing the Reliant 
Energy - Entex allocation to 
make sure this happens.


Thanks,
Michael

Coping With Job Stress

  At a seminar called "Stress and Disease"  by Dr. Nickolas Hall, an
expert in psychobiology, gave an example of a coping skill for job
stress which I would like to share with you.

  When you have had one of those "Take This Job and Shove It" days,
try this:

On your way home after work, stop at your pharmacy and go to the
section where they have thermometers. You will need to purchase
a rectal thermometer made by "Q-tip". BE SURE THAT YOU GET
THIS BRAND! When you get home, lock your doors, draw the drapes,
and disconnect the phone so you will not be disturbed during your
therapy.

Change to very comfortable clothing, such as a sweat suit, and lie
down on your bed. Open the package containing the thermometer,
remove the thermometer and carefully place it on the bedside table
so that it will not become chipped or broken.

Take the written material that accompanies the thermometer and as
you read it, you will notice in small print the statement that says,
"Every rectal thermometer made by Q-tip is PERSONALLY tested."

Now.... close your eyes and say out loud five times, "I am so glad that
I do not work in quality control at the Q-tip company."





The new pub code is in ERMS.  The name is GDP - HH + 2AFTA.

Thanks for your help.

There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is 
the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.  This 
was due primarily to slightly cooler temperatures (Entex takes were slightly 
higher) and an extra day of flow (31 vs. 30).  Let me know if you have 
further questions.


Thanks,

Eric

Here's the 10 year basis curves, per Ed.  Note that the Carthage curve is

EricA guy at work is thinking about upgrading his home speakers.  He really likes 
a set already and wants to buy them, but they require a high powered amp. 
His question is does the quality of the amp make that big of a difference 
assuming equivalent power levels?  i.e for a given level of power how much 
does the quality of the high end amp matter?

Eric, Ami just booked two deals (#148251, #148253) on the BDOL pipe and since 
that pipe had never been used before we do not have that location mapped to 
any curves.  As a result those two deals have not bridged to CPR and will 
remain like this until you provide the necessary curve information listed 
below.  If you will need to create new curves and that will take a while, let 
me know if you want me to map this location to some existing curves in the 
meantime, so it will at least bridge to CPR.  Then, when you create your 
curves I can just re-map the location to the new curves.

There is currently only one zone on this pipe.

         
Pipe Code Zone Code   Notional  Mid Market  Gas Daily
BDOL  BDOL        ???          ???         ???

SIPPING VODKA
A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly
speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.
The monsignor replied, "When I am worried about getting nervous
on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water
glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning
of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He
proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he
found the following note on the door:

1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not
referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.
8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T."
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he
said,"Take this and eat it for it is my body."  He did not
say, Eat me"
12.  The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the Cherry,"
13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub
thanks for the grub, yeah God.
14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at
St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.


The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings
good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the
chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money.
Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You
will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain
is not broken.
