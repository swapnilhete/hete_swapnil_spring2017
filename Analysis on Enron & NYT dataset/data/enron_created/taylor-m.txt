I have no objection to changing the product name.  The tax issue concerns the

Mark,

I have not yet been contacted by legal/tax regarding the change of 
description for PIX indices.  We still basically want only to delete "US" and 
replace it with "PIX".  To my simplistic, non-legal, mind this is a pretty 
simple issue....can't we just do it??

Hi Mark:

As Portland General Electric Company prepares for its sale to Sierra Pacific

assist us with ISDA issues.  Is there a firm, or an individual that you could

My thoughts concerning potentially novel elements of EnronOnline:

1.  The online "making of a market" i.e. the continuous posting of real-time 
prices for both purchases and sales of commodities
2.  The online ability to enter into an energy commodity or commodity 
derivative transaction.
3.  The continuous and frequent updating of prices - including the operation 
of the "Stack Manager" which automates this process in many ways so that the 
system can react more quickly than a person.
4.  EnronOnline uses multiple levels of contractual language - a single line 
"short description" of abbreviated terms identifying the transaction to the 
trader, a long description which defines the abbreviated terms and adds 
additional legal language and general terms and conditions which contain the 
remaining contractual terms and are accepted only once by the counterparty.
5.  The site directs counterparties to different contracts based on the 
counterparty profile containing both credit information and information 
concerning the contracts the counterparty already has in place.
6.  It may be relevant for any or all of the foregoing that the EnronOnline 
system is web-based - i.e. the user does not require any system-specific 
software but just a web browser (and an internet plug-in application)
7.  The Master User account gives the counterparty the ability to set up 
passwords for sub-users for that entity and control the access and trading 
authority of various password holders.
8.  Each user can create customized screens showing only those products in 
which he or she is interested.
9.  The system provides for the submission of offers to transact by 
counterparties which are automatically accepted or rejected by the system 
based on pre-established criteria resulting in binding contracts.

Based on earlier conversations, I have identified the following business 
methods that may be novel from a patent point of view:

1.   our site is offering "prime" paper rather than seconds or ends
2.   credit risk is managed by the site (credit intermediation) without cost 
to customers
3.   customers can access financial derivatives on paper to manage price risk 
on physical paper products
4.   customers have access to financial derivatives to manage price risk on 
prime offerings

Please give me your comments on this so we plan our strategy.

The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t=
he=20
terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll=
=20
have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. =
 I=20
also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is=
=20
traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20
Descriptions:

Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel=
y=20
clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i=
n=20
the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  If so, maybe we should add a lin=
e=20
something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS-3 for this=20
Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic reference to the=
=20
relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentence=20
referring to the quality as well.

Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere?

The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -=
=20
there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the=
=20
GTC.  Unless industry trading convention is to the contrary, the site makes=
=20
more intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the sa=
me=20
units.  If the volume is Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number=
=20
some counterparties (or perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.=
 =20
The GTC contains the defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit=
. =20
It seems to me that if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the=20
volume as Bandwidth Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth=
=20
Unit and the number of DSO miles for the transaction. =20

Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20
beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to=
=20
the GTC.

The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20
parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about=
=20
this more than I.)

If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I=
=20
would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth=
=20
Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha=
t=20
the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per=
=20
month'.

Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to =
be=20
clear from the Long Description.


So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with=
=20
something like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=
y=20
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The price=20
shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of th=
e=20
General Terms and Conditions shall apply to this Transaction. =20
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=
e=20
Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20
Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20
Date>. =20
The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling=
=20
Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,=20
CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20
Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20
LSAJCAWZH04).
The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit=
=20
per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per=
=20
month.=20


If quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesn't work it would b=
e=20
more like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=
y=20
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website. The number of=
=20
DSO=01,s per Bandwidth Unit is 672. The price shall be as submitted by the=
=20
Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of the General Terms and Condition=
s=20
will apply to this Transaction. =20
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=
e=20
Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20
Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20
Date>. =20
The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling=
=20
Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,=20
CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20
Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20
LSAJCAWZH04), for a total of 2,446 DSO miles.
The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one DS0 mile per=
=20
month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per mont=
h.=20
Therefore, the Contract Price will be calculated as follows: price x the=20
number of DS0=01,s per Bandwidth Unit x the number of DS0 miles x the numbe=
r of=20
Bandwidth Units.

Please let me know if you have any questions - I will go ahead and approve=

the product in the system so you can proceed without me if necessary.

The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t=
he=20
terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll=
=20
have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. =
 I=20
also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is=
=20
traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20
Descriptions:

Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel=
y=20
clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i=
n=20
the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  You are correct. If so, maybe we=
=20
should add a line something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS=
-3=20
for this Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic referenc=
e=20
to the relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the=20
sentence referring to the quality as well. We have changed the first senten=
ce=20
of the long description to read " A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron=20
Broadband Services, L.P. ("EBS") pursuant to which the Seller shall sell an=
d=20
the Buyer shall buy the quantity of DS3 Bandwidth Units submitted by=20
Counterparty via the Website.

Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere? DS0 is a term generally known in t=
he=20
industry and is only used in the calculation of the Contract Price in the=
=20
long description, so we chose not to define it - also the definition is=20
incredibly long, complex and technical.  If you feel strongly about it, we=
=20
can include it, but since the long description tells you how many DS0's you=
=20
should include for calculation purposes, we didn't think that it was=20
necessary.

The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -=
=20
there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the=
=20
GTC.  The formula in the long description differs from the formula in the G=
TC=20
(and in the Master Agreement) in order to accomodate the way that the price=
=20
is being quoted on EnronOnline. The quote represents the variable component=
=20
of the "Unit Price" in the GTC's and the Master Agreement - In order not to=
=20
confuse people, we decided to include the formula in both the long=20
description and the confirmation so that customers could know that the Unit=
=20
Price was calculated using the price quoted.  Unless industry trading=20
convention is to the contrary, the site makes more intuitive sense when the=
=20
volume quoted and the price quoted use the same units.  If the volume is=20
Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number some counterparties (or=
=20
perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.  The GTC contains the=
=20
defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit.  It seems to me tha=
t=20
if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the volume as Bandwidth=20
Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth Unit and the number =
of=20
DSO miles for the transaction. =20

Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20
beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to=
=20
the GTC. Since bandwidth is such a new product, we really wanted to highlig=
ht=20
to customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidth=20
(which is what we are offering) they will need to establish connectivity wi=
th=20
us.  This is already in the GTC - but in an abundance of caution, we wanted=
=20
this fact highlighted, especially since connectivity will entail further=20
costs to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation=
=20
agreements, licenses etc. - this can be quite an involved process.

The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20
parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about=
=20
this more than I.) Agreed

If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I=
=20
would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth=
=20
Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha=
t=20
the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per=
=20
month'. It is a quote for one DS0 mile of a Bandwidth Unit for a month. =20
Since the short description indicates the period for the contract being=20
offered, we felt like the quotation was pretty clear.  We are also a bit=20
sensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the lo=
ng=20
description.  From a commercial perspective, we are comfortable that the=20
language used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate.

Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to =
be=20
clear from the Long Description.  If a Customer wanted to buy 5 of the OC3=
=20
Bandwidth Units quoted for the period from July 1- July 31, the Customer=20
would be entitled to 5 OC3's for the period from July 1 - July 31.  I hope=
=20
that this is responsive to your question - we weren't entirely clear.


So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with=
=20
something like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=
y=20
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The price=20
shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of th=
e=20
General Terms and Conditions shall apply to this Transaction. =20
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=
e=20
Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20
Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20

The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling=
=20

CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20
Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20
LSAJCAWZH04).
The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit=
=20
per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per=
=20
month.=20


If quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesn't work it would b=
e=20
more like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=
y=20
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website. The number of=
=20
DSO=01,s per Bandwidth Unit is 672. The price shall be as submitted by the=
=20
Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of the General Terms and Condition=
s=20
will apply to this Transaction. =20
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=
e=20
Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20

The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one DS0 mile per=
=20

Therefore, the Contract Price will be calculated as follows: price x the=20
number of DS0=01,s per Bandwidth Unit x the number of DS0 miles x the numbe=

Please let me know if you have any questions - I will go ahead and approve=

I'm in Buenos Aires today and talked to Andrea about her computer.  While 
they are having big problems with her laptop (it likes to eat hard drives) 
she will be able to bring it along (it's a Compaq Armada 1500C - will that 
fit in the docking station?).  In case it isn't working, can we get her set 
up with one of the Windows 2000 machines that are being installed Tuesday 
morning?

Good morning, girls.

Did you know that Andrea Calo, attorney from the Argentina office, is coming 
to the Houston office on Monday morning , May 1, for a two week stay?

At Mark Taylor's request, please arrange an office, computer, and phones for 
her.  I will reserve an temporary ID for her through security.  Regarding her 
computer, she will let me know later this a.m. if she will be traveling with 
her lap top.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Sorry for the 
short notice, I just found out.

Thank you,
Taffy




I haven't been able to get into any off these things.  Do you know what they 
are?

Mark, 

This resume is the daughter of a Director in Human Resources.  She has a law 
degree and has worked as
a legal assistant/paralegal throughout her career.  I do not think her 
background is as strong as some of the other
candidates that you have seen.  But, I decided to send it anyway because it 
is an employee referral.  Take 
a look at it and let me know what you think.

We are now able to open these but can't say I'm any happier about it.  Well, 
maybe that's too extreme - at least it seems like a good idea in principle.  
But I do have several questions:  Do we have a similar system here in NA?  
Are we expected to review all of these?  Is there some way to filter out the 
junk?  To whom should I address these questions?

We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or 
trading
of any of the products set out in question 1 above through the internet.  
Under
Japanese law, formation of any contract does not require any formality.

Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or
acceptances to be valid as such. There is no Statute of Frauds, and parties 
may
make most types of contracts orally. If there is enough evidence establishing
that the offeree agreed to the terms offered, an offeror may rely on it. In 
most
simple sales contracts for consumer goods, for example, it would be easy to
prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y. The Seller's
electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy 
product
Y should be enough in this context.

In more complicated contracts, the structure of the seller's Web pages should 
be
carefully designed. Having no court decisions, we have no definite answer to 
the
question of enforceability of shrink-wrap agreements in Japan. However, the
legal implications of the Web-wrap, the online version of shrink-wrap, may be
somewhat different from shrink-wraps (e.g. licenses for software sold over the
counter).  Under a typical shrink-wrap license in the real world, for example,
the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the
product. However, in an on-line environment, a customer has a choice to click 
on
an Accept-to-Buy icon before the customer purchases the product. Further, 
with a
carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able 
to
let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the
icon, it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and
conditions than in a typical shrink-wrap license situation. Unlike shrink-wrap
in the real world, the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the
customer clicked on the icon. Given these differences, the result possibly may
be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrink-wrap licenses.

If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or 
U.K.
law and the transactions contain a choice of such law, such transactions,
including the choice of law, will be enforceable in Japan.

We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws,
regulations, or court cases.  So long as  the party maintains the relevant
website with a computer server located outside Japan, the likelihood of 
Japanese
regulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such website
established a "physical" establishment/branch in Japan is negligible.

Hey Amanda!

Yao just gave me your e-mail address.  He had told me you were at UVA a 
couple of months ago.  How do you like law school so far?  I have to admit I 
pretty much hated every minute of it.  Now that I think about it, I can't say 
that being a lawyer had been all that much fun either.  Oh well, the pay is 
pretty good.

I found this picture of my boat on the internet site of the charter company 
that rents it out for me when I'm not sailing (which is most of the time).  
When are we going sailing again?  Got any good vacation weeks coming up?  The 
Caribbean sure sounds good right about now......

Please let me know if you have any revisions.



I agree that an electronic system of tracking these things is a good idea.  
Either the electronic or manual system will be admissable, but the electronic 
system strikes me as more reliable.  I'm more concerned witht he 
effectiveness of the notification - it's still not clear to me that adding a 
line on the ticker will be satisfactory.  In fact, it clearly is not 
satisfactory for changes in the ETA or a GTC.  Those documents will have to 
be clicked on again if any changes are made, the only remaining question 
being how do you highlight the changes.  The significant gray area is still 
changes to the Long Descriptions.

Subject: Tracking Legal Text Changes

It is important that we track when we have given notification to parties 
about changes to the Long Descriptions or GTC/ETA wording.

Although the standard form of ETA does not contain any notice requirements, 
it has been modified for some parties to say that we will "give notice".

Regardless of whether or not we are obligated in the ETA to give notice, it 
is important that we do - and can prove that we have done so.

Therefore, we should ensure that we keep an internal log of the change 
notifications (dates and text). 

Jay/Mark: Until we have a more developed notification process, can we have an 
electronic log of when a particular ticker item appeared and was then removed 
from the website? I assume this would have to be some sort of built text 
field, to account for possible multiple addtions and removals. Is this simple 
or hard to do? This would be more reliable than a manual log, and if 
generated manually, would hopefully be more admissable in court (Mark, can 
you comment?)

Sheri/Amita/Dale: Until we have a system solution, can you ensure you 
coordinate on some sort of manually maintained notice log?

Thanks,

Dave

Yes, I will take care of this one.Let me know if this is what you had in mind.
Is this for you?

New York Mercantile Exchange Announces E-Commerce Venture

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
CONTACT:
Nachamah Jacobovits
(212) 299-2430
Maria Gonzalez
(212) 299-2436
NEW YORK, NY, May 4, 2000 - The board of directors of the New York Mercantile 
Exchange last night approved the formation of eNYMEX, an e-commerce venture 
that is intended to become the premier, global exchange for over-the-counter 
(OTC) forward trading and clearing of a wide range of standardized physical 
commodity contracts. 
The board also established an implementation schedule and retained the 
services of Andersen Consulting to work on the venture. 
The Exchange plans to use its proven clearing infrastructure to introduce 
complete counter-party risk management for OTC trading, and create net 
margining with Exchange futures markets by calculating a consolidated 
clearing position. eNYMEX will provide a single, internet-based interface to 
both the OTC market and the Exchange futures market by routing futures orders 
to the trading floor and the NYMEX ACCESSc electronic trading system, 
depending on the session. 
The Exchange's vision for the venture also includes pursuing strategic 
partnerships through which eNYMEX would provide clearing services to external 
organizations and creating a credit structure that will permit floor members 
to participate in OTC markets. 
The range of OTC products offered will initially focus on swap contracts in 
crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity, with some spot 
cash market products also offered. Over time, this would be expanded into 
such areas as precious and base metals, coal, and, potentially, bandwidth, 
weather, and emissions. Although the initial geographic focus will be on 
North America, contracts are also expected to be offered for some European 
and Asian locations. 
In addition to today's launch announcement, the key milestones of eNYMEX, are 
expected to be a third quarter introduction of OTC trading, followed by 
Internet-based order-routing for futures trading, including a common 
interface for OTC and futures trading, and clearing and settlement of OTC 
trading. 
Exchange Chairman Daniel Rappaport said, "The global energy and metals 
community has expressed a strong need for an electronic OTC platform that 
provides an open, independent, and neutral marketplace for trading by all 
participants, price transparency, counter-party credit risk management, and 
the liquidity created by simple standardized contracts." 
Mr. Rappaport also enumerated several other advantages of eNYMEX over other 
available OTC systems: 
? Leveraging the proven market management capabilities of the Exchange. 
? The combination of the existing futures and options markets with the eNYMEX 
electronic OTC market provides an ideal combination of e-commerce with 
"bricks & mortar". 
? The Exchange's established and well-regarded clearinghouse, which will be 
used to provide counter-party risk management 
? Net margining of positions across the futures and OTC markets, providing 
significant cashflow benefits to participants trading across markets and 
commodities. 
eNYMEX will be a wholly owned, for-profit subsidiary of the New York 
Mercantile Exchange.

Sorry I missed you earlier - please blame Louise who refused to let me leave 
the meeting I was in with her to call.  I tried to call you in London just 
now but there was no answer.  If you are still around, please feel free to 
try me again but if that doesn't work I will be in all next week and am happy 
to set up a time that works for you.

I spoke to Mark yesterday and he is moving as fast as possible - it may be a 
good idea to start with a detailed term sheet  whilst the fuller document is 
in drafting (we will be using external counsel to speed things up).

I looked at your list of products (sent by Kevin) which is a great deal wider 
than those we quote.  I think the best qay to proceed would be with a 
manageable list from which we build as soon as both parties are happy with 
the technology.
I have attached a draft list below (natual gas an power only so far), the 
terms would be dependent of their availability.  When do you plan to 
introduce financial transactions?



Due to the time difference this week - the easiest way of contacting me is 
email.  I would also suggest we think about setting up a meeting for early 
next week to go through the draft.

Hi Mark,

Thanks for taking time on Friday to participate in our meeting.  I think we
made good progress -- by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to
resolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from my
office forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on
HoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from
EnronOnline.  Louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft
agreement available late in the day on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I wanted
to confirm this timing so I can make sure I have the appropriate individuals
on my end ready to turn it around.  I think it is in everyone's interest to
try to push this forward this week.

Please let me know if you need any additional information from
HoustonStreet.

Best regards,

Louise,

Sorry I forgot to answer your financials question.  We already have
financial swaps for gas.  Financial electricity we can add very quickly with
someone's design assistance.  We only need minimal help to validate product
specification.  Functionality won't change.

I'm sorry if I was unclear on Europe/Japan.  I agreed that if you give us
your numbers in those markets you would get 10%, but I need to know whether
you are going to do that as part of this deal so I can complete other
liquidity partner discussions accordingly.  It wasn't intended as an open
option.  We can discuss Europe and Japan in the future, I'm just not sure I
can guarantee you 10% at that time.  I've got my Board primed if we do it
right now.  Perhaps we could agree that we will do it and you get your 10%
in each entity now, but that the actual technology link doesn't start until
later this year?

Regards,
Frank

I thought the European/Japan 10% was done ie if we put products we get 10%,
ie an option we could decide on later.

Any idea also on the financial date as our guys do not think we can make
any volume targets without it.  We are working on crude and products.

Also Mark please liaise with Frank on the documentation you require from
him.

Subject:  RE: Follow-up on Friday's meeting


Louise,

Thanks for your email.  Your list for power and gas products are fine. I
agree we can add products/markets going forward as appropriate.  We also
discussed posting your numbers for crude and products.  I believe we agreed
crude and products would not be part of any volume targets, but that we
would incorporate those products in the first round.  Please provide me a
list for crude and products based on what we offer on HoustonStreet.  Also,
any thoughts on whether you want to take me up on my offer to include your
numbers in Europe (UK, Germany and Scandanavia) and Japan for an additional
10% equity in each of those markets?  The reason I ask is that we are
engaged in liquidity partner discussions right now and your answer might
affect our decisions.  We are on target to go live in Europe this Summer.

As for corporate docs, we are prepared to deliver whatever you need to see
whenever it is appropriate.  Just let me know when you would like them and
I'll arrange to get them to the appropriate individual at Enron.

Regards,
Frank

I spoke to Mark yesterday and he is moving as fast as possible - it may be
a good idea to start with a detailed term sheet  whilst the fuller document
is in drafting (we will be using external counsel to speed things up).

I looked at your list of products (sent by Kevin) which is a great deal
wider than those we quote.  I think the best qay to proceed would be with a
manageable list from which we build as soon as both parties are happy with
the technology.
I have attached a draft list below (natual gas an power only so far), the
terms would be dependent of their availability.  When do you plan to
introduce financial transactions?

(See attached file: product list.doc)

Due to the time difference this week - the easiest way of contacting me is
email.  I would also suggest we think about setting up a meeting for early
next week to go through the draft.

Regards

Louise

Subject:  Follow-up on Friday's meeting


Hi Mark,

Thanks for taking time on Friday to participate in our meeting.  I think we
made good progress -- by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to
resolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from
my
office forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on
HoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from
EnronOnline.  Louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft
agreement available late in the day on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I wanted
to confirm this timing so I can make sure I have the appropriate
individuals
on my end ready to turn it around.  I think it is in everyone's interest to
try to push this forward this week.

Please let me know if you need any additional information from
HoustonStreet.

Best regards,
Frank Getman
fgetman@houstonstreet.com






Frank - 

There appears to have been a mild snafu with my e-mail address (my fault, not 
yours) and I have just now seen your note from yesterday morning.  I am 
working on the Posting Agreement.  I'm afraid Louise may have thought more 
highly of my abilities to create something like that from whole cloth than I 
deserved but we will try and get that to you soon.  Travis McCullough, our 
corporate lawyer, will get together a term sheet on the equity side of things 
which we should be able to get to you quickly (no later than Thursday if his 
schedule permits).  I'm assuming that your legal team will have to be 
draftsmen of the definitive corporate documents but the term sheet should 
give them a good starting point (and let you confirm that the lawyers on both 
sides are getting it right).

Sorry for the delay and confusion - we'll get these out to you as soon as we 
can.

PICK NEWS - CALLS (continued)
*******************************************************
AOL  $144.50 -$1.25 (-2.00)  Hmmmmm-AOL flat for the week?
NOT!!  We deliberated whether to keep or drop AOL today,
but decided to keep it.  Read on.  AOL spiked up to close
at $165 earlier this week and has shed $20 in the last 3
trading days since.  Especially noted was the drop of $9
yesterday on 25 million shares (10 million more than
average-not a good sign).  Today though, AOL held up well
in the face of strong down-market forces on lower than
average volume.  It is, after all, the most stable of the
Internet stocks and is not going away.  While AOL feels
comfortable like a family pet, remember it's a trade that's
gone against us, and normally we would get out.  But with
the shaky Brazilian market perhaps drastically affecting
the rest of Latin America, we think the bad news and fear
is already in this stock.  We think of it more like a
rubber band stretched in reverse where the farther it's
stretched back, the harder it will snap forward.  It's
nerve-racking waiting for the bounce, but AOL is a split
candidate over $120 and should give us a great performance
once it snaps.  With a record breaking Christmas and 22,000
new users every day, AOL's earnings should be great.  Look
for the split announcement any day, or at the latest, with
earnings due Feb. 9 per Zack's. (There has been some
confusion on the actual date; Motley Fool board says as
early as Jan. 27.  We'll keep you posted.)  Still an
Internet-guts required.  Play with caution.

WCOM  $71.00 $2.94 (-4.00)  In this type of trading
environment where the "big picture" whollops the average
company press release, it pays to sit on the sidelines.  We
warned in Tuesday's letter that WCOM may need to
consolidate a bit before moving up, and urged discipline
before entering another trade.  We hope you waited.  WCOM
is still a great play, but we still need to wait for the
recovery before playing this pick.  They are now at their
30 day moving average and should bounce off it, market
permitting.  $70 is their support price.  Wait for the
bounce.  If it breaks below $70 and holds, we'll re-
evaluate and likely drop it.  WCOM is in high-bandwidth
content delivery tests with AOL, which should be successful
and more fully implemented through Bell Atlantic and SBC's
DSL services.  Remember too, they just won the FTS2000
contract (worth $5 billion)to provide the U.S. Government
with voice and data services for the next 8 years

T  $82.13 -$2.63(-$2.93)  AT&T is holding up quite well
given the market retrenchment this week.  The need to move
voice and information throughout the world will not
diminish, even in a down market.  AT&T could actually
become a low cost producer who benefits from cost-conscious
users exercising corporate belt-tightening.  It behaves
like a safe haven in a down market and a tech stock in an
up market.  Volume has been heavy over the last 2 days.  If
investors wanted to dump this stock, we'd have seen more
damage to the price.  Support is at $82 with better support
at $80.  AT&T's prospects are still great with the
integration of TCI helping to complete the "last mile" of
service availability to your home.  AT&T continues to melt
the copper in favor of fiber replacement at every turn.
Wait for the bounce and confirm market direction before
playing.

DELL  $77.63 -$1.69 (-$0.18)  Dell is holding up nicely
this week given the weak market performance.  Dell's volume
has also been weak.  We spoke with investor relations and
are now able to determine that volatility has greatly
diminished, and since their split in September, volume too.
Dell used to trade 50 million shares per day on average.
As the daily average is figured, the high numbers drop off
and new, lower numbers replace them.  This will naturally
reduce the average until it more closely resembles the
actual daily trades currently taking place.  It should not
be long until these 2 more closely resemble each other.  In
other words, the low volume is no longer cause for alarm
and supports our original assessment that huge daily price
swings are a thing of the past.  Dell's story is still the
same-big sales increases, more markets served, higher
margins.  When Dell's news season picks up (Feb.-March
according to investor relations), Dell will again be on
investors' radar screens.  Nothing's changed; they're just
a little quieter.  Still on our favorites list, consider
the slight retrenchment as a buying opportunity when the
market gets over its jitters.  Now's a good time to scale
into the trade, but confirm market direction first.

LXK $97.00 3.25 (-3.56) LXK fell with the rest of the market
on Thursday. We still like LXK with earnings coming up on
the 19th of January and the strong possibility of a stock
split. The Open Buying on the Internet(OBI) standard has taken
another leap forward with the adoption of Lexmark Interna-
tional's new OBI-compliant Internet purchasing system.  The
Kentucky-based printing solutions company has adopted a new
system that eliminates many of the manual processes Lexmark
previously used to purchase indirect materials.  Lexmark
has partnered with SupplyWorks, a Web-based purchasing
services company.  For the first time, buyers are not required
to purchase software to manage supplier connections.

LOW $51.38 -.31 (-3.31) LOW showed some nice strength today
with a loss of .6%. The DOW went down over 2%. LOW was
listed as one of the stocks picked in the dartboard contest.
Whether the professionals picking LOW is good or not is
a decision you'll have to make (just kidding). Look to last
Sunday for why LOW is a pick.  LOW's has earnings in mid-
February.  No new news.

ATI $78.81 +1.56 (-.19) ATI bucked the trend on Thursday, and
went up. Rumors continue to circulate about ATI being merged
with either BellAtlantic or Vodaphone. It's rumored that VOD
is offering in the range of $90 a share. The question now is
whether Bell is willing to raise its bid to match VOD. Thursday's
price increase was mainly due to this speculation. Bell did
just get notice from the SEC that its bid would classify as
a pooling of interests.  ATI is still $11 away from the rumored
bid by Vodaphone.

LU $105.93 +1.69 (-9.32) LU is a great company, with stock
split possibilities, and earnings coming up: so why are we
dropping it? We aren't. We have re-added LU to the pick list.
Last Tuesday we dropped LU because of the buyout situation
with Ascend. On Wednesday, the deal went through and it seems
LU has finished dropping. LU opened on Wednesday at $98.50,
yet closed at $104.50. LU is scheduled to report earnings on
January 21st. This date is in debate. We will try to get the
official date from LU directly. Though they are just short
of shares necessary to do a 2-1 stock split, they could
announce a split with earnings, contingent to the vote on
increasing shares in February.

BUY CALL APR-110 LU-DB OI=2978 at $11.25 SL=8.50
BUY CALL APR-115 LU-DC OI=3300 at $ 9.00 SL=6.50


XIRC $38.13 .50 (-.37) XIRC has held up pretty well through
this market debacle.  Earnings are on January 21st and XIRC
has announced earnings with surprises of no less than 10% over
the last four quarters.  This normally will help XIRC to have
an earnings run into the announcement. XIRC's 10-dma is at
$37.00. Watch for upward movement before initiating new plays.

NEW CALL PLAYS
******************

COF  Capital One Financial $127.18 1.18 (-.12 for this week)

Capital One Financial, a financial services holding company,
is the parent for Capital One Bank, one of the US's top 10
credit card companies. Using the information on consumers in
its massive databases, the company solicits Visa and
MasterCard customers by mail. The company's 3,000 variations
of annual percentage rates, credit limits, finance charges,
and fees range from platinum and gold cards for preferred
customers to secured and unsecured cards for customers with
limited credit histories. Other subsidiaries include a
federally chartered savings bank that offers credit cards,
consumer lending, and deposit services and a company that
provides internal support services.

COF is near its 52-week high and when this stock breaks out,
it tends to really go. We feel with earnings coming up on the
19th of January and the possibility of a stock split, this
could end up being a great play. COF is sitting right on its
20-dma and held up pretty well compared to the market. Watch
for upward movement and then jump on for the ride.

Preliminary numbers for credit card numbers are looking very
positive for the holiday season. An analyst at JP Morgan feels
that COF outperformed its peers. An analyst at Goldman Sachs
stated; "The combination of strong fees driven by account
growth improvement in core credit is likely to produce very
strong earnings visibility at both Capital One and Providian."
Earnings are expected to come in strong.

************************************************************
TLAB - Tellabs $80.69 -$0.44(+$6.38 this week)(P3W $10.18)

Tellabs is quickly becoming a powerhouse in the Telecom
equipment industry. With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems,
and its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from
customers among the telephone companies, cable operators,
and government agencies.  Though they faded from news of
their failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major player.

TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78 on 11 million shares,
$8 higher than resistance previously set at $70.  We thought
it would quickly fall back; we were wrong.  TLAB drifted back
to $74, then spiked $5 to $79, on average volume of 3.5 million.
Over the previous 3 trading days, it gained in market weakness
while giving back only $.44 in heavy trading in a downright
bearish market-a terrific sign of strength.  Technical
indicators are positive, so is the chart indicating a small
correction already taking place.  3.5 million shares traded
daily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share in cash;
34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.   TLAB will be a
winner when the market turns.  We expect them to announce more
contracts in the coming weeks.  Recent news is capturing
investors' eyeballs, making for a good story.

Here goes.  Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised ther rating
to a "buy" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35
and $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000, respectively.
They further stat, "fundamentals for the telecom equipment
group has improved over the past few months which improves
visibility for Tellabs" and "Our checks with Tellabs will
report fourth quarter 1998 results slightly better than our
$0.58 earnings per share estimate, as well as having a positive
outlook for 1999" (Reuters).  Also, rumors surfaced last week
that TLAB was a targeted buyout/merger candidate, but were
quickly squashed.  Not soon enough though to draw investor
attention to the price move.

DIS - Disney $36.06 -.06 (+3.50)

Striving to be the premier entertainment company, Disney has
revenues of $10,055.1 million. It is involved in movies,
television, theme parks and resorts, home video, travel,
books, music, theater, and creative design. Recently, It has
added an internet portal in a joint venture with Infoseek, in
which it has a 43% stake.

The past year has been tough for Disney, due to high
programming costs at its ABC division, and to weak demand for
its products in Asia.  Last week Merrill Lynch's Jessica
Reif Cohen lowered earnings estimates for the current fiscal
quarter from .27 to .23, and for the fiscal year ending Sept.
1999 from .91 to .86. She cited softness in consumer products
and broadcasting operations, and continued weakness in Asia.
However, three other analysts believe the stock is oversold
and that DIS is experiencing a recovery.  On Jan.12th, Goldman
Sachs raised their rating from Neutral to Outperform, and
Salomon Smith Barney raised theirs from Neutral to Buy. On Jan.
11th, ING Baring Furman Selz upgraded DIS to Buy from Hold.
On Jan. 12th, Disney and Infoseek launched their new
Internet portal site, Go Network (www.go.com).  Numbers show
that it will be one of the top 5 sites on the Internet.
Following the upgrades and the new portal launch, Disney
stock has performed well. Its chart looks good and it has
pushed through the major moving averages. Although it was
down today along with a lot of other stocks, it is still
up $3.50 for the week, showing strength.

Disney is still ironing out final details for production
and technical workers to return to work following a one
day strike on Nov. 3rd. Their contract had expired 3/97. The
company has named Thomas Schumaker a new president and put
him in charge of its animated movie and theater business. Also,
DIS may acquire Goldenbooks and is interested in Livent Inc.,
a theater co. When the market resumes its upward movement,
look for Disney to move back up.  Earnings are due out by
next Thursday (1/21) according to First Call.

Adobe Systems, Inc. (ADBE) - $47.69
Software

Adobe Systems, Inc. (ADBE) is a leading provider of publishing
and imaging software technologies, and the second largest
desktop software company in the world with annual revenues
approaching $1 billion. Adobe develops, markets and supports
computer software products that enable users to create,
display, print and communicate all forms of electronic
documents. Computer application products accounted for 78%
of fiscal 1997 revenues and licensing, 22%.

The Company continues to be cautious about licensing revenue
in the short term due to weak Japanese market conditions and
uncertain timing of OEM customer introductions of products
incorporating Adobe's latest technologies. The Company is
coming out of a recent restructuring and trying to focus its
resources on high growth revenue opportunities in digital
color, color inkjet, short-run on-demand digital printing,
and digital copiers... although licensing revenue is likely
to be flat in the short-term. Other risks include product
shipment delays, market acceptance of new products and
upgrades, declines in printer licensing business.

Stock likely to fail at key resistance point of $48.
Declining relative strength and aggressive earnings
projections may disappoint. Many analysts have a hold on the
stock. Slight distribution taking place among top
institutional shareholders. Likely to test 52 week lows.

COMBINATION PLAYS   Bang! Booommm! Craaash!...What was that???
******************************************************************
January 13, 1999 update

U.S. stocks crumbled at the opening on Wednesday morning on news
that Brazil's central bank president had resigned, sparking an
across-the-board flight to quality that rocked world stock markets.
The Dow was off 136, the Nasdaq down 113 and many issues had not
yet begun to trade. By mid-morning, stocks were on the rebound,
lifted by a recovery in Brazil and massive bargain hunting. By
noon, the panic was gone and many traders were selling partial
positions to lock-in gains. At the close, the Dow fell 125 points
to 9349.56 and recouped more than half its early losses. Even so,
the decline was viewed as a reminder of market vulnerability after
a series of record highs.

Our portfolio was very active. We will begin with the new plays:
LU was the focus of our attention and it dropped hard with the
rest of the high visibility techs. The stock traded as low as $96
but the first option prices available for the FEB105C/110C left
us with a debit of $1.75. Morgan Stanley raised its rating of LU
to a "strong buy" late in the morning and that helped the stock
move higher through the day. LUV was the next offering and it was
also significantly lower at the open. The first few trades on the
FEB22C/25C went through at about $1.25 debit. LEVL was far less
affected by the morning activity and the best we could do on the
FEB30C/35C was $3.25 debit. DIS was our personal play-of-the-day
and we managed to trade along with everyone else (fighting the
overwhelmed internet brokerages) with a $4.00 opening cost-basis
for the JAN00-40C/FEB40C LEAPS/Calendar spread.

In other portfolio plays; It was a great opportunity to double-up
(reducing the cost-basis) on some of the more favorable debit
positions. AOL and OXHP were our candidates and these stocks were
down at the open. The prices were: AOL, FEB155C/160C at $1.50 and
OXHP, FEB17C/20C at $1.00. We will reflect these separate trades
in the monthly summary. Of course, some of the calendar spreads
were in need of a correction and we used the opportunity to pare
losses from the recent run-up. Short positions were closed on:
ATI; JAN70C at $7.00, GM; JAN70C at $11.00, and PCS; JAN22C at
$2.38.

T was quite a mover! In the morning melee, we purchased the JAN80C
at $2.50 (with the stock price near $82) and subsequently closed
the FEB80C during the midday rebound for $8.50.

One other opportunity arose on the NXTL straddle. The MAY35P could
have been closed for $5.25, leaving the long (call) option; MAY30C
at cost of $2.87.

January 14, 1999 update

U.S. stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon as the impeachment trial
against the President added pressure to an already shaken market.
Political instability is a catalyst for investor uncertainty and
that was evident as the DJIA fell 228 points to 9120, erasing all
the big gains for 1999. The Nasdaq Composite Index was also lower,
down 40 points at 2276. Stocks have been poised for a downturn
following the recent run-up in prices but some thought the strong
U.S. economy would protect the stock market from the impeachment
drama. However, the trial opened in an investment climate that had
already been shaken by the devaluation of Brazil's currency and
jittery investors flocked to the exits.

On Thursday, we used the morning bounce to fill some of our open
calendar positions: On ATI, we rolled up to the FEB75C at a bid
price of $7.25; GM was also moved to a diagonal spread with the
sale of the FEB75C for $8.50 and PCS was moved to the next higher
strike with a FEB25C at $2.87. These spreads are no longer neutral
and are now more aggressive with the new strike positions but we
expect all of these stocks to remain at-or-above current prices.

For Friday, we still have a number of suspect issues. CPQ and CD
are near the sold strikes and we may need to close those positions
before the day is over. FTU is fading as the merger speculation
dwindles and LU is still "one to watch" as the ASND deal unfolds
and the company earnings report aproaches. Good Luck!

CIEN - Ciena Corp.  $18.68     Merger Speculation

CIENA Corporation designs, manufactures and sells architecture,
dense wavelength division multiplexing systems for fiberoptic
communications networks. In September, Ciena and Tellabs cancelled
their merger agreement and shares in the rival equipment makers
fell sharply after Ciena's financial outlook soured, primarily
because an expected contract from AT&T fell through. In early
January, coverage was initiated by Prudential as the telecom
sector started to soar. Then the share price spiked on speculation
the telecommunications equipment-maker might find a merger partner
after the announced purchase of Ascend by Lucent. Some say there
is a market rumor that Cisco Systems is preparing a bid of $25-$28
per share for Ciena. Technically, the stock price is back in a
recent trading range around $17 (November-early December) and we
will use this previous support and the excellent OTM premiums to
create a favorable play.

SDTI - Security Dynamics  $25.50     Put-Credit Spread

SDTI provides enterprise network and data security solutions to
help companies conduct business securely, protect corporate assets
and facilitate electronic commerce. Most of the recent lawsuits
have been forgotten and the analyst upgrades have had a positive
effect. The company started a market trial program designed to
simplify implementation of higher levels of security for customers
like IBM and also introduced SecurWorld, a new flexible program
for delivering two-factor authentication on the web. Just a good
technical play with Internet bias. The stock price is trading
above all recent resistance and the current trend remains bullish.

SRCM - Source Media  $20.87     Put-Credit Spread

SRCM is a provider of on-demand information and programming
through cable television and telephone lines, using the company's
proprietary digital operating systems to mass market consumers.
Source Media delivers more than 15,000 advertiser-driven audio
programs. Customers can subscribe to Source Media audio content
and have it featured on their web site as a type of Internet radio
show. The company has launched new audio programming with online
broadcaster, Broadcast.com which includes weather, sports and
stock news. SRCM says the roll-out of Internet audio shows means
it now has content and advertising on personal computers, digital
cable TV and telephones. A rumored deal with American Online may
also be causing some of the buying pressure and the stock has good
technical suppport around $17.

******************************************************************
AAPL - Apple Computers  $41.38     Put-Credit Spread

AAPL designs and manufactures and markets personal computers and
related personal computing and communicating solutions for sale
to business, education, home and government customers. A few weeks
ago, shares of Apple jumped after its iMac consumer PC was named
the top-selling personal computer at the retail level during the
month of November. Not only was the iMac the leading product, it
has been the number one selling PC since its introduction back in
August. The iMac has captured 5.9% of retail unit sales and it was
the only PC to break into the top five best-sellers group in four
months.

Now the bad news; one day after reporting excellent earnings, APPL
dropped $5.12 when an analyst voiced concerns about the pricing of
its iMac. This surprise downgrade comes even as the computer maker
reported revenues that easily surpassed Wall Street expectations.
The APPL chart looks negative from a short-term perspective but
there is still a long history of support around $37. Play this one
on downward momentum by opening the long position first. Then sell
the short position when the stock price firms, to create the credit
spread.

PLAY (aggressive):

BUY  PUT FEB-$35.00 AAQ-NG OI=400 A=$1.18
SELL PUT FEB-$37.50 AAQ-NU OI=400 B=$1.75

REFER TO THE MID-WEEK PLAY OF THE DAY...SUNW...
******************************************************************
SUNW - Sun Microsystems  $94.50     Calendar Spread/LEAPS

SUNW supplies enterprise network computing products including
desktop systems, servers, storage subsystems, network switches,
software, microprocessors and a full range of services.

Personally, I just like this company from long-term perspective
and the "Covered-calls on LEAPS" strategy is a favorable way to
take advantage of the extreme near-term option premiums.

Please refer to the January 12, newsletter article concerning
SUNW for more information:

http://www.optioninvestor.com/playoftheday/index.asp

PLAY (conservative/long-term):

BUY  CALL JAN00-100 LSU-AT OI=1580 A=$19.63
SELL CALL FEB-100   SUQ-BT OI=3181 B=$5.87
NET DEBIT TARGET=$13.50 ROI TARGET=100%

Note: In the long-term calendar spread, we are reducing the net
cost of the LEAP by the amount of credit from the sale of the
nearer term call. If the near-term call expires worthless, we will
sell the MAR call to further reduce our debit. If your short-term
position is ITM on the last day of the strike, you need to buy it
back so that you DON'T have to exercise the long-term position. In
that case, your LEAP is going up in value also and on the last day
of the strike period, the short call will shrink down to intrinsic
value so you will be ahead in the play even after you buy it back.

Japan, Asia, Russia, Brazil. Who is next??


Another day, another excuse for profit taking. The market sold off
again with the Brazilian flu along with a dose of impeachment blues.

The market started down early and showed little interest in turning
around. The rumors from Brazil were all negative. Coupled with the
resignation of yet another government official the rumor that the
Central Bank was set to let the Real float knocked the Brazil market
for another -10% loss. Floating the Real, the Brazilian currency,
would be a drastic devaluation since the currency would then be free
to find its own level.

Floating could start the domino theory fall of all the surrounding
Latin American countries that depend on Brazil for trade. Chile and
Argentina would be the first to go. If South America were to devalue
as a group then the countries who export to South America would be
put on a diet. The U.S., depending on who you talk to and what area
they reference, exports to South America account for between 17-25%
of our total. Companies like Colgate derive 40% of their revenue from
Latin countries.

If the feared event happened then the results would be drastic. The
companies who derive a large percentage of their business from there
would suffer huge earnings shortfalls. Layoffs could occur, plant
closings, etc. That would be the extreme but it is possible. Possible
but not probable. There are many things that can and will happen
before we get to that point. Rest assured that every Fed head in the
world is concerned about the Brazil problem. The IMF will be very
interested in preventing this scenario. Cardosa is very interested.
Power and pressure are being brought to bear. The Brazil Central
Bank issued a strongly worded press release stating they would use
every means at their disposal to prevent floating the Real. They
said they would use their $50 bln in reserves to protect the Real.
This was only minimally comforting to the market this afternoon.
Memories of many other countries last minute claims to the same
intent, and then immediate devaluation, are fresh. Russia was the
latest. While analysts feel there could be serious impacts from a
possible worst case, they also feel that the market has now discounted
the most likely scenario which is months of protracted, painful,
negotiations ending in an agreement of some sort to yet another bail
out. No harm, no foul. Just uncertainty.

Meanwhile the market has now "corrected" five percent off its record
high of just last week. My how short our memory can be. 9643, only
five trading days ago. Champagne was already being ordered for the
Dow 10,000 celebration. Should we cancel the order? Not hardly.

As I have said many times the market cycles. Remember last week when
I kept warning you about an impending bout of profit taking. Its'
here and I don't think it is over. Fear of darkness is only beaten
out by one other thing. Fear of a long holiday weekend. Yep, closed
Monday for MLK day. I have already had one of my brokers call me to
ask if I want some currency positions left open over the long weekend.
Seems the currency market closes at 1:PM on Friday. Now if you were
a country that needed to manipulate some currency to benefit your
country, a U.S. holiday would be the perfect time. Don't laugh.
Japan does it all the time. The same thing on a smaller scale can
happen to stock profits held over a holiday. Events happen, mass
exodus at Tuesday's open. Remember Wednesday morning?

You may think I have put on a fur coat. Far be it from the truth.
I am long several hundred contracts of tech stocks and I am looking
for a recovery soon. Again, being long does not make me right, just
very interested in the outcome.

I have not elaborated on the market impact from the impeachment trial
and won't because I don't think there is any impact. As I have said
before, the chances of a guilty vote are about zero and the market
knows this.

If you watched any market TV today then you know the Internet stocks
are finally starting to weave. They are getting beat from all sides.
Brokers are cutting the ratings on the high flyers left and right.
Funny how the smell of blood brings out the crowd. Nobody would cut
them last week when they were adding $20 a day. It is dogpile time
now. To add insult to injury the online brokers are now starting
to prevent customers from actually buying the stocks. I am not
kidding. Some have taken them off the margin list. If you want to
buy you have to pay cash, 100%. Others will not let you buy them
online. You have to call a broker and wait on the line while they
verify your eligibility to purchase high risk investments! Others
refuse to execute the trades at all. You might hurt yourself. Does
it strike you strange that Internet brokers will not let you buy
Internet stocks??? What ever happened to the concept of "it is
your money not theirs." In the face of this conspiracy to protect
you from yourself the Internets are losing ground quickly. Except
AOL. AOL has somehow avoided the label of "overpriced" and actually
garnered several honorable mentions from analysts downgrading other
Internet stocks. Guess where Internet money will go now?

For you technicians out there the pendulum has swung from
overbought to oversold in a very short period of time. The Dow
is now down -522 points in the last five days. Both the Dow and
the Nasdaq have corrected about 5%. Just as the sharp run up last
week was begging for a dip, this sharp dip is now begging for a
rally. The big drop today was on the lightest Dow volume in over
a week. Not as much conviction today just a lack of buyers. This
was also the third triple digit loss in a row. As I mentioned
earlier I think the odds for a down day Friday are still pretty
good. The wild card again is the options expiration which normally
provides an upward bias. I can't build a case for a strong move
upward because of Brazil and the holiday but I can see a strong
Tuesday coming as long as Brazil does not meltdown over the weekend.
Earnings will be on us in earnest next week with MSFT, LU, SUNW
announcing along with dozens of others. I think the focus on
Brazil will have dimmed and the anticipation of upside surprises
will take center stage.

Good Luck

Jim Brown

Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
******************************************************************

Stay Focused on the Pinnacle Index

After selling off precipitously over the past couple of days, it
is very important to keep in eye on the Pinnacle Index and other
put/call ratios for clues as to whether the sell-off is a major
reversal or profit taking.

Based upon the early returns, it appears that most option
speculators are viewing the sell-off as profit taking and this
could be prove BEARISH over the near-term.  Despite the negative
economic news from Brazil, the Pinnacle Index actually climbed
and other put/call ratios indicate increased call buying.

Add this to the latest Bullish figures from Investors
Intelligence (60% Bullish 1/14) you get the impression that
investors are ignoring economic and corporate earnings pressures.

Pinnacle's short-term indicators are still flashing bearish
overtones over the near-term so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.  Any questions
regarding market sentiment can be directed at:

The Power of Expectation Analysis

It has often been said that the crowd is right during the
market trends but wrong at both ends.  Measuring and
evaluating the sentiment of the crowd, therefore, can give
savvy option traders a decided edge.

PICKS WE DROPPED
****************
When we drop a pick it doesn't mean we are recommending a sell
on that play. Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.
We drop a pick because something happened to change its
profile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we
don't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.
We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are
unfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we
want them to look at any current pick as a valid play.


CALLS:
******

CMGI $105.00 -8.44 (+40.75) After being derailed by the
Brazilian devaluation bomb midweek, the market when into
a tailspin and the Internets were no exception.  After
Monday's earth shaking surge of $71.75, CMGI has dwindled
away 31 points in the last 3 days ($62 pre-split).  With
a host of downgrades raining down on several of the big
hitters in the Internet sector, we figure it is time to
dodge the bullet before some valuation happy analyst sets
their sights on CMGI.  We are cutting CMGI loose and
hopefully it's consolidation will be quick.

AMZN $138.00 -10.00 (-22.25)  Brazilian devaluation.
Analysts' downgrades due to valuation.  Bearish short-term
remarks.  Impeachment proceedings.  Option expirations.  What
else can we add to the mixture in this pot of volatility??
Amazon had been doing just fine when it popped up over +$75.00
last week.  Not this week!  On Thursday in a sign of weakness,
Amazon finished only two and a half points off its low for the
day to close at $138.00.  Even earnings reports from companies
such as Yahoo that beat estimates weren't enough to carry
sympathy plays like Amazon into positive territory.  We are
dropping Amazon as a pick.  This is not to say that Amazon
won't turn around- and soon.  But in light of current
circumstances, we feel there are safer plays to be in.

ASND $82.13 +1.81 (+10.69) We finally got the price that LU is
paying for ASND, and it is .825 shares of LU for each share of
ASND.  The reason we are dropping ASND is because it has
effectively turned into a LU play since the purchase price has
been announced.  There is a little more room for ASND to move
given the share ratio, but typically the acquiree does not
close the gap completely because of the uncertainty of the deal
being closed.  There is no hint of competing bids, but ASND
would be a current play again if a bidding war started for it.

SLR $83.56 -1.50(-6.07) We are dropping SLR with the idea
we might pick it back up closer to the earnings report and
stock split date. As predicted, SLR announced a 2-1 stock
split this week. They announced after close on Wednesday.
Unfortunately, with the market volatility, SLR went down on
the day. We did see an opening that sent SLR up a few dollars,
but this faded into a loss by days end. SLR could definitely
see a split and earnings run, but we feel it's better to wait
for confirmation.

JPM  $102.00 4.56 (-12.44) The comeback in financial stocks
was derailed this week.  Hammered by the problems in Brazil,
JPMorgan lost another $4.56 today.  When we initiated this
play, JPM had momentum and its chart looked good.  However,
it's exposure to Brazil is too great, and given the seriousness
of the political and economic troubles in that country, we
have to drop JPM as a play.

GDT  $103.63  3.38 (-3.37) Guidant has lost ground since
setting an intra-day high of $119.75 on Monday. With just
13 days to go before it splits, GDT should be cruising into
a split run. It tried on Monday, but weakness in the overall
market has held it back. If the market turns positive again,
so will Guidant.  However, with the questionable market
footing we are going to cut Guidant loose until things firm up



PUTS:

PICK NEWS - CALLS
*******************************************************

FTL  $17.06 -.06 (-1.44)  FTL was added as a possible take
over play this week.  Something is going on but what?  We
are constantly pouring over news and rumor mongers only to
discover on Wednesday morning wires, trading was halted for
a block of shares (73,100) to trade at $16.06 down $-1.56.
Then we read about 100,000 shares being crossed by
Goldman Sachs.  Plus another 100,000 was traded at $17 today
by Salomon Smith Barney.  Unlike the techs' FTL did not suffer in
todays' trading, opening $17.69, taking a little off the table
to $16.69 then closing at $17.06.  Not providing a great
warm a fuzzy feeling, but enough of a feeling to keep this
as a play.  Remember, rumors are predicting a buyout at $23
or more.

MYG $63.25 -0.69 (-0.75)  Between Tuesday and Wednesday, MYG
seemed to be holding its own and only lost thirty-one cents
as the market dropped a combined -270.33 points.  But
Brazilian woes continued and the market plummeted another
-228.63 on Thursday.  Maytag fought and fought but finally,
the market scored a point with a knock-down.  Maytag was
stunned and conceded -$0.69.  MYG is normally a strong play
and is still one of our split candidates.  But, the market
is extremely volatile and we suggest waiting for things to
turn around before starting any new plays.

SUNW $94.50 -2.31 (+3.62)  Sun is one of the brightest stocks
on Wall Street even though the Brazilian storm continues to
darken the market.  Sun is up +$3.62 on the week from positive
press releases and rumors of a possible take-over by IBM.  On
Wednesday, CNBC presented the rumor which ended up being
dismissed as smoke but option trade volume increased none the
less.  We will keep you posted of any changes in the scenario.
In other news, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its 12-month
price target for SUNW to $132, up from the previous price of
$104.  Not only does Sun have the only end to end computing
platform used in telecommunications services, it is also
working on incorporating its Java technology into the digital
TV industry.  Even though SUNW got ruffled by the market and
dropped -$2.31 on Thursday, SUNW is still a strong play.
Earnings for the company are scheduled for Jan 21st (not the
15th as we had previously reported), a prime time to announce
a possible split.  Look at the additional dip as a buying
opportunity but wait for some signs of a turn around before
entering.  Trying to catch a falling knife tends to damage
fingers and trading capital.

EMC $93.88 +1.56 (+.31) EMC is a pretty amazing momentum stock.
The NASDAQ is down 1.7% today, and EMC goes up.  On Wednesday,
EMC's gap down went as low as $84, but it was such a fast
market it probably was not a price you could have gotten
easily.  During the first 15 minutes of trading on Wednesday
1 million shares were traded.  This was almost half of
Wednesday's volume, and one-third of EMC's average daily
volume. There hasn't been any news on EMC, but then again, it
doesn't look like we need any.  FYI  In our Sunday write-up we
had EMC's earnings release date as 1/28, but we have since
learned that the release date is either 1/25 or 1/26.

JBL $71.31 -.69 (-3.56) JBL held up pretty well today
considering the action in the market.  I am sure that the
coverage initiated on JBL by Everen Securities helped.  The
press release did note, however, that in the near-term they
believe that JBL is close to fair value, but in the long term
it should be an outperformer.  The other bit of news that
probably helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for one
stock split.  As we have said on more than one occasion, this
industry tends to move together, but JBL appears to be the
upper crust of a volatile group.

UTX $108.56 2.31 (-6.13) UTX is very Dow sensitive.  Let's
illustrate it.  The Dow is down 2.3% today and UTX was down
2.1%.  It has been that way all week.  The only thing at this
point that would probably change UTX's price movement is a pre-
earnings announcement one way or the other.  UTX announces
earnings next week.  On the news side, we are amazed at the
number of varied businesses of UTX.  For example, today UTX
announced that its Hamilton Standard unit signed a letter of
intent to joint venture with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to focus
on the maintenance of pneumatic aircraft components.  In the
press release it indicated that it's Hamilton unit also makes
space suits for the NASA shuttle program.  Only play UTX if the
Dow is moving up.

MSFT  $141.75 -$2.06 (-8.13)  Like we said, don't try to
catch a falling knife.  Though, we shrugged off an ugly
beginning to finish over 1 point positive yesterday, today
we gave it back, and then some.  We're still positive on
MSFT given their trial has begun to produce positive news,
like their appeal of the Judge's decision to force MSFT to
use Sun's version of Java in its Windows operating system,
and a new stream of MSFT-friendly witnesses on the stand.
Furthermore, Prudential Securities said analyst Doug Crooke
initiated coverage of Microsoft Corp. with a rating of
accumulate and a price target of $175 a share.  MSFT is
still a split candidate at over $140 and will announce
earnings January 19 after the close.  We realize that
trading options is inherently risky and caution to wait for
a reversal in the stock and the overall market before
starting another play.  If it falls another day, let it
fall.  The point is to catch a good entry on the way up,
not on the way down.

Our research has revealed no statements of regulators in Japan in connection

internet or other electronic systems from publicly available source.  We will
let you know if we find any previous or future statements.

We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or 
trading
of any of the products set out in question 1 above through the internet.  
Under
Japanese law, formation of any contract does not require any formality.

Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or
acceptances to be valid as such. There is no Statute of Frauds, and parties 
may
make most types of contracts orally. If there is enough evidence establishing
that the offeree agreed to the terms offered, an offeror may rely on it. In 
most
simple sales contracts for consumer goods, for example, it would be easy to
prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y. The Seller's
electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy 
product
Y should be enough in this context.

In more complicated contracts, the structure of the seller's Web pages should 
be
carefully designed. Having no court decisions, we have no definite answer to 
the
question of enforceability of shrink-wrap agreements in Japan. However, the
legal implications of the Web-wrap, the online version of shrink-wrap, may be
somewhat different from shrink-wraps (e.g. licenses for software sold over the
counter).  Under a typical shrink-wrap license in the real world, for example,
the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the
product. However, in an on-line environment, a customer has a choice to click 
on
an Accept-to-Buy icon before the customer purchases the product. Further, 
with a
carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able 
to
let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the
icon, it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and
conditions than in a typical shrink-wrap license situation. Unlike shrink-wrap
in the real world, the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the
customer clicked on the icon. Given these differences, the result possibly may
be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrink-wrap licenses.

If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or 
U.K.
law and the transactions contain a choice of such law, such transactions,
including the choice of law, will be enforceable in Japan.

We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws,
regulations, or court cases.  So long as  the party maintains the relevant
website with a computer server located outside Japan, the likelihood of 
Japanese
regulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such website
established a "physical" establishment/branch in Japan is negligible.

Dear Mark

In Yasuyoshi Goto's view the agreements are well drafted and contain nothing
which is likely to cause a problem in Japan.  On the understanding that server
is to be located outside Japan, we have only the following comments:

Time of Execution

Section 3. (c) of the ELECTRONIC TRADING AGREEMENT provides that "Transaction
shall be deemed executed at the time that Enron first signifies its acceptance
of Counterparty's offer, accessible on the Website server."

We understand that this means a contract will be formed when Enron 
"dispatches"
its acceptance to its Website server so that the acceptance can be seen by the
Counterparty's computer display (if he has not yet disconnected).  In other
words, the contract will be formed at that time even though the Counterparty
does not see Enron's acceptance (due to disconnection, communication error, or
some other reason).  If this is indeed the intention, the language could 
perhaps
be clarified in this regard.  (Since the agreement is governed by New York 
law,
we have no objection to the current language if this is clear under New York
Law.  Perhaps the UCC covers the point?)

Governing Law/Jurisdiction

We see no problem with the governing law and jurisdiction provisions as they
are.

Taxation

Would you please confirm the role if any to be performed by Enron Japan in
relation to this business, so that we can ensure that Enron Japan will not be
seen as a dependent agent (and therefore permanent establishment) of Enron 
North
America Corp.

Best regards

David Samuels and Rahil Jafrey have come up with an idea for an incentive to 
get people to use EnronOnline.  They want to set up a sports fantasy league 
system on the website allowing users to accumulate points and then awarding

Mark -

You might consider treating the choice of law and submission to jurisdiction 
as two separate issues.  For example, if BC law is not objectionable, we 
could choose that law to apply but not consent to the jurisdiction of any 
particular court.  The most likely outcome (at least in many US states) would 
be that we would end up in a BC court if we had to sue them but unless we 
have significant contacts with BC (e.g. an office there) they would have to 
sue us in Alberta.

		 Subject: Choice of Law for Master Firm Gas Purchase/Sale Agreement with BC 
Gas Utility Ltd.


To:  The Legal Trading Committee

Enron Canada Corp. ("Enron Canada") is in the process of negotiating a Master 
Firm Gas Purchase/Sale Agreement (the "Master") with BC Gas Utility Ltd. ("BC 
Gas").  In this regard, we have recently received a request from BC Gas to 
amend the "applicable law" of the Master from Alberta to British Columbia 
such that subsection 17.12 of the Master would read as follows:

"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed, enforced, and performed 
in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia, without 
regard to principles of conflicts of law, and each Party hereby submits to 
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of British Columbia."  

BC Gas has also asked that the applicable law for the guarantee of Enron 
Corp. be governed by the laws of British Columbia.

While I am fairly sure that we will be able to persuade BC Gas to accept the 
State of Texas as the appropriate law for the Enron Corp. guarantee, it seems 
unlikely (because the counterparty is a British Columbia utility that 
operates primarily in British Columbia) that BC Gas will accept any 
jurisdiction other than British Columbia with respect to the Master.

Although I have not been called to the bar in British Columbia and there may 
be some quirks and minor differences between the jurisdictions, it is my 
understanding that the commercial law of British Columbia is generally not 
much different from that of Alberta.  Nevertheless, I am seeking your 
comments and consent to such an amendment to the Master.

Should you have any questions or require additional information, please give 
me a call at (403) 974-6708.  Thank you for your assistance with this matter.

Yours truly,

Mark Powell




Yes, I spoke to her earlier this week.Sorry I didn't get back to you in response to your voice-mail.  I was hoping 
I could talk to Carol and Sara to see if anyone remembers why we incorporate 
the Credit Support Documents by reference.

Regarding the cross-default, we usually do not expand the definition since we 
don't want to bring in other derivatives transactions - of course that was 
before we started doing derivatives under various master agreements with the 
same entities.  It may be time to revisit this one.

		 Subject: ISDA - Cross Default

Mark

As mentioned at our trading meeting on Tuesday, we are putting together a 
tailored ISDA schedule for our banking counterparties with which we propose 
to trade credit transactions.

One issue we have revisited is whether the definition of Specified 
Indebtedness (which ties into the cross default provisions) should be 
expanded to cover derivatives transactions as well as the more conventional 
bank borrowings.  

We think there are arguments both ways on this, but wonder whether we have a 
"house view".  Since the definition is not expanded in our standard ISDA 
schedule, we assume that our preferred position is to exclude derivatives 
transactions from the cross default provisions of the ISDA.

Perhaps we can discuss this when you have a spare moment! Thanks

Kind regards.

Paul

This looks fine to me.  The tax section of the draft was a holdover from the 
initial survey done in Europe last year.  In this case, I assume that Lynn is 
taking care of the tax issues and may be using different counsel for tax 
issues.  In Brazil the entire tax section of the memo was deleted before it 
was sent to counsel.

Tana,

The language in the Schedule should reflect what is in our Form#3, whereby 
"Enron Re:" is the U.S. entity and "Swiss RE - EFR" is a Barbados entity.  
Also, the tax form requested should be a W-8.

In addition, the following language should be added to the confirmation:

United States Federal Income Tax Characterization and Reporting.  The parties 
recognize and intend that, for United States federal income tax purposes, any 
payment by the Counterparty of the Floating Amount will be treated as a 
payment pursuant to a guaranty by the Counterparty of the obligations of Bob 
West Treasure, LLC to make payments pursuant to Section ___ of the 
[underlying Financing Agreement between Bob West Treasure and Royal Bank of 
Canada.]  The parties agree that to the extent either of the parties is 
required to report any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit 
relating to the Transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, 
such party shall report such item consistent with the characterization set 
forth above and shall not take any position on any tax return or report 
relating to United States federal income taxes which is inconsistent with 
such characterization.  The parties recognize that the manner in which they 
have agreed to characterize the Transaction for United States federal income 
tax purposes may be inconsistent with the manner in which the Transaction is 
characterized for other tax purposes and for accounting, regulatory or other 
purposes.  The provisions of this Section are not intended to affect the 
manner in which the parties report the Transaction for such other purposes, 
or the interpretation of the provisions of the Confirmation and the rights 
and obligations of the Parties arising hereunder, for any purposes.

Thanks for your note.  In reply:

1.  We will change United Kingdom to England in the governing law section.

2.  and 3.  We did switch to the English law form and our form didn't provide 
for using securities as collateral.  As you point out, it is likely that SR 
will always be in the money and the CSA provides for an unlimited Threshold 
for SR at all times so that it will never be providing collateral under that 
document.   There are certainly other changes that could be made to the 
document with that in mind but in the interest of time we didn't make much of 
an effort on that score - our theory was that you wouldn't mind too much 
since you would never have to post anything under this document.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or comments.

I looked at the EFR-ENA Schedule in connection with Gordon Boozer's
comments.  I see no problems except:

1.  The document is expressed to be governed by the law of the"United
Kingdom."   I have never seen this formulation and think it should say
"England," as I believe there are in fact multiple legal systems (e.g.,
Scottish) within the U.K.

2.  I am not sure why all collateral except LCs was deleted.  Was this
agreed by EFR?  If so, OK.  If not, could the CSA provide for other
collateral as Gordon requested.  It is unusual for SR entities to use LCs
in non-reinsurance situations and would probably cost them less to post
Treasuries.  Here it is of course unlikely that EFR will have to post
anything, since EFR will always be in the money to some extent.

3. Did you switch to the English law form of CSA?

Regards


That certainly makes sense to me.  I had better talk to Paul about the 
appropriate procedures going forward.

now that we are officially behind a chinese wall can this process be 
reevaluated?  I think that it will be increasingly difficult to scale at the 
pace we need to over the coming months if we can not design an automated

Bryan -

The process for approving these involves sending the names to the General 
Counsels of the various operating companies here in Houston.  Several of them 
then send the lists to the senior business people in their organizations.  
Unless there is a real urgency, I would suggest that we send the list all at 
once instead of piecemeal.  What do you think?

Thanks for your note.  In reply:

1.  We will change United Kingdom to England in the governing law section.

2.  and 3.  We did switch to the English law form and our form didn't
provide for using securities as collateral.  As you point out, it is likely
that SR will always be in the money and the CSA provides for an unlimited
Threshold for SR at all times so that it will never be providing collateral
under that document.   There are certainly other changes that could be made
to the document with that in mind but in the interest of time we didn't
make much of an effort on that score - our theory was that you wouldn't
mind too much since you would never have to post anything under this
document.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or comments.

I looked at the EFR-ENA Schedule in connection with Gordon Boozer's
comments.  I see no problems except:

1.  The document is expressed to be governed by the law of the"United
Kingdom."   I have never seen this formulation and think it should say
"England," as I believe there are in fact multiple legal systems (e.g.,
Scottish) within the U.K.

2.  I am not sure why all collateral except LCs was deleted.  Was this
agreed by EFR?  If so, OK.  If not, could the CSA provide for other
collateral as Gordon requested.  It is unusual for SR entities to use LCs
in non-reinsurance situations and would probably cost them less to post
Treasuries.  Here it is of course unlikely that EFR will have to post
anything, since EFR will always be in the money to some extent.

3. Did you switch to the English law form of CSA?

I brought this issue up to David Forster AGAIN, and again he suggests that if 
we are going to change the Product Description that we call it US Gas Swap - 
so a Product on the website would read, for example:

US Gas Swap   IF CNG SP               Jun00           USD/MM

We really don't want to change the name to Fixed/Float because the US Gas 
Daily products are ALSO Fixed 
Float trades, and we are afraid we would be misleading. 

Please talk about this and if this suggestion is acceptable we will make the 
changes. Also please remember that this
change requires manual intervention, so each month when you roll the product 
over you will need to let us know to 
make the change when you call to have the product activated. We also won't be 
able to use Tokenized Reference 
Periods on these Products.

The launch of Phase 2 of EnronOnline will include significant enhancements 
and additions to the EnronOnline web site.  One of the attributes of the 
Phase 2 launch is the development of individual Commodity/Country Home 
Pages.  The objective of the individual home pages is to allow each commodity 
group create its own web site (within EnronOnline) and to deliver a more 
personalized experience for the customers.  A significant aspect of the home 
pages is the addition of content which will be developed at a desk and or 
company level.  The content which we are adding will be much more dynamic and 
require constant changes.

In this light we will need to develop an approval process which protects 
Enron however does not completely impede our effort to provide current 
interesting content on the web site.  In addition we will need to make sure 
that we include the neccessary disclaimers to avoid other issues.

To date we have started to accumulate a significant amount of content 
(written, audio, PowerPoints and video) which is scheduled to be included in 
the Phase 2 launch.  We will need to sign off on this content within the next 
couple of weeks.

I have asked Lorraine Becker by copy of this note to arrange a meeting to 
develop a process of content approval.

Hello my Esteemed Doctors,

I am in Rodney Malcolm's Commercial Transaction Group focusing on selling 
energy outsourcing relationships to industrial consumers. 
Based on the list of executed master agreements that was provided to us 
recently, many of our targeted industrial customers have not signed our 
master swap agreement. 

In preparation for our transacting with these customers, would you send me as 
soon as possible a copy of our Master Swap Agreement language, a copy of the 
more intermediate "Omnibus" Short form Swap agreement, and a copy of the one 
or two page confirmation agreement.  I will forward to my group so that they 
can become more familiar with the language, and I will also accumulate the 
industrial customers that we are closest to closing deals.  I will then 
forward the names of those customers to you so that we can get these 
documents to the customers in advance of the deals.

If you have any questions or comments, please call me at x35583.  Thank you,

Hello Bob and Ed.

What is the most efficient way for us to get Master Swap Agreements in place 
with our industrial consumers.  With the commodity energy market going 
through the roof, many of the industrials are asking us to concentrate on 
solving their short term commodity exposure and look to establish a  greater 
outsourcing opportunity in the future.  We do not seem to have Master Swap 
Agreements in place with industrials such as IMC Global, AK Steel, WR Grace, 
and our solutions will involve financial swaps.


Thank you. Tim



Jason - would you take a quick look at this - I think Legal in London will be 
negotiating it so you don't have to be particularly thorough - but I thought 
you might have some insights given your recent experience with our other

I agree with you 100%.  I hope that Mike can make it clear to John that it is 
never appropriate to criticize another department - whether Legal or anyone 
else - in such a public manner.  If he feels there is a problem that should 
be corrected, he should proceed through proper channels.  In this case, a 
direct one-on-one conversation with Andrea strikes me as the most obvious 
route and if that is not possible, not productive or just too awkward, he 
should have approached either you or Mike.  Sending out an e-mail that might 
be considered personally critical of Andrea in such a public way is clearly 
contrary to our core value of Respect.  I hope you are able to have some 
input into the review process for John and this should certainly be 
mentioned.  If you need my help in any way, please let me know.REMOVE

Let's get right to the point.

I am looking for positive motivated people that
want and need to increase their income by 10k per month.

Do you have a burning desire to change the quality
of your existing life?

Would you like to live the life that others only dream about?

If you think this is too good to be true or are skeptical
then this may not be for you... Many have been conditioned
to believe it must be illegal, immoral or unethical to ever
earn any real profits from their efforts.

The fact is we have many people in our enterprise who earn
over 50k per month from the privacy of their own home and
are retiring in 2-3 years obviously wealthy and having total
freedom both personal and financial.

How would you like to:
1. Drastically reduce personal, business and capitol gains taxes?
2. Protect all assets from any form of seizure, liens, or judgments?
3. Create a six figure income every 4 months?
How about:
1. Restoring and preserving complete personal and financial privacy?
2. Create and amass personal wealth, multiply it and protect it?
3. Realize a 3 to 6 times greater returns on your money?
4. Legally make yourself and your assets completely judgment-proof,
seizure-proof, lien-proof, divorce-proof, attorney-proof, IRS-proof,
and become completely insulated?

Are you a BIG thinker, BIG dreamer and a person that believes they
deserve to have the best in life?

Are you capable of recognizing that once in a lifetime opportunity
when it's looking right at you?

Countless others have missed their shot at the title only to look back
years later and wished they should've because they could've.

If you are serious about changing your life...

Mark,

I have researched and provided Brent with information regarding the two 
"Enron standard" laptops that are now being utilized.  We have decided on the 
Compaq M700 which has a little bigger keyboard (better for  a man's hands)  
and weighs a little less than the M300 model.  Please approve this order by 
forwarding this message to Janette Elbertson.  Thank you!  

Janette:

Please order a Compaq M700 Laptop for Brent Hendry.  Charge it to Mark 
Taylor's group (Co. 413 / Rc. 1157).  Brent will be here officially the first 
week of July but will be "in and out" of the office the last week of June.  
If we could have his computer up and running by June 23rd that should cover 
it.  Let me know if you need any additional information.

Thanks to both of you!

One day, while walking down the street, a highly successful lawyer was 
tragically hit by a bus and killed. His soul arrived up in Heaven, where he 
was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself.

"Welcome to Heaven," said St. Peter. "Before you get settled in, though, it 
seems we have a problem. You see,  we've never once had a lawyer  make it 
this far and we're not really sure what to do with you."

"No problem-just let me in," said the lawyer
 
"Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let 
you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven, and then you can choose whichever 
one you want to spend an eternity in."  

"Actually, I think I've made up my mind...I prefer  to stay in Heaven," said 
the lawyer 

 "Sorry, we have rules," said St. Peter, and with that, he put the lawyer in 
an elevator  and it went  down-down-down to Hell.

The doors opened and the lawyer found himself stepping out onto the putting 
green on a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club, and 
standing in front of him were all of his friends and fellow lawyers with whom 
he had worked. They were all dressed in black tie and evening gowns and 
cheering for him. They ran up and kissed him on both cheeks and they talked 
about  old times. They played an excellent round of golf, and that night went 
to the country club where he enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner.

The lawyer even got to meet the Devil, who was actually a woman and very good 
looking.  He had a great time telling jokes and dancing.  In fact, the lawyer 
was having such a good time, that before he knew it, it was time to leave.

 Everybody shook his hand, thanked him for coming  and waved goodbye as he 
got on the elevator.

 The elevator went up-up-up and opened back at the Pearly Gates, where he 
found St. Peter waiting for him. "Now it's time to spend a day in Heaven," he 
said.

 So the lawyer spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing 
the harp and singing. He had a great time, and before he knew it, his  24 
hours were up. St. Peter came and got him.

 "So, you've spent a day in Hell and you've spent a day in Heaven. Now you  
must choose your eternity," he said.  The lawyer  paused for a second, and 
then replied, "Well, I never thought I'd say this. I mean, Heaven has been 
really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell."  So St. Peter 
escorted him to the elevator and again he went down-down-down, back to Hell.  

 When the doors of the elevator opened, the lawyer found himself standing in 
a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. He saw his friends and 
fellow lawyers were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and 
putting it in sacks.

The Devil appeared before the lawyer.  She now had horns sticking out of her 
head, fire spit out her ears and nose  and she had a very evil laugh

The lawyer stammered:   "I don't understand.  Yesterday, I was here and  
there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and danced and 
had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all of my 
friends and fellow lawyers look overworked and miserable." 

The Devil looked at the lawyer and smiled.

 "Yesterday we were recruiting you; today you're ours."

Mark,

I was thinking that it might be helpful for us to take Series 7 exam here in 
the US like our counterparts are taking SFA exam in UK. I did some initial 
research and found that our "compliance" group has to open an account with 
NASD (National Association of Security Dealers) in order to take the exam.

I don't know whether we already have sunch an arrangement in US with NASD for 
our other groups. If we do, could you guide me to talk to the appropriate 
person. If we don't than please let me know and we will decide, whether it is 
worth pursuing further.

Thanks and regards
Moazzam

Subject: Market Commentary

Dan, here's our first ever market commentary.  I gather the information will 
be very stale by the time eol v2 is up and running and that this will serve 
primarily as a place holder in our web page.
From our perspective, we'd much prefer to have indenpendent "neutral" sources 
(such as Platts, ICIS, CMAI ....) do the analysis, or at least do a feed.  
The reason is (a) we'll never be construed as neutral and (b) we're so thin 
that the traders themselves are the only ones who can put this together.



Thanks,
Alan

Dan,

I didn't speak to slides 6, 9, or 14 of the original presentation sent to

them in with no audio.  If in the final review it is determined that these

If you didn't believe us before, I'm sure it is by now painfully clear that 
negotiating master swap agreements is a very lengthy process.  My impression 
is that the commercial team in Portland is anxious to begin trading 
financially.  If this is correct, it would be possible, at least from a legal 
point of view, to begin trading now under the existing documents.  In each 
case where a master agreement is already in place, trades entered into before 
the amendments we want will certainly be binding on both parties.  Our only 
issues with trading under these agreements are where we need more restrictive 
credit provisions and that resumption of trading before an amendment is 
signed reduces to some extent our negotiating leverage.  As to the credit 
issue, only the credit group can decide whether or not to permit trading 
under the existing terms.  As for the negotiating leverage, if the commercial 
people want to resume trading immediately, my suggestion would be to let them 
go ahead.  If it turns out that additional leverage is needed, we can always 
stop trading.

Where no master swap agreement exists, we have documentation available to 
enable trading on a limited basis until the master is signed.  The so-called 
"omnibus" confirmation will work for any normal commodity derivative 
transaction and can be customized to include necessary credit provisions - 
even where multiple trades exist with the same counterparty.

Tana has unsuccessfully tried to get you access to our Lotus Notes database 
so you could determine the status of any negotiation on an up-to-the-minute 
basis.  She will be sending a monthly report of our progress until you get 
the necessary software to access the database.  Of course, if any issues come 
up in the meantime, please continue to feel free to call.----- Forwarded by Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT on 06/08/2000 05:19 PM -----

Mark, Taffy said you're under the weather. Hope you're feeling better by the 
time you open this. The attached draft is revised slightly from the one I 
previously sent to you for review. The changes are nonsubstantive from your 
standpoint - -  most of them were made to clarify that there will be 
offerings from the pipelines other than open seasons. In making the changes, 
I forgot to do a redlined draft for you, so I am faxing to you a copy 
redlined by hand. 

Thanks again for all your help.

Here is the most recent draft of the Posting Agreement which we would like to 
discuss with you at our meeting tomorrow.
This is certainly a tough one.  We go to great lengths to avoid regulation 
here and have been fairly successful to date.  We do have some oversight from 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regarding our power trading 
and pipeline activities and local state regulators keep an eye on our purely 
intrastate pipeline activities, but for the most part we are unsupervised.  
If it helps, we conduct our derivative trading operations in accordance with 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulations (but that's just 
complying with the Eligible Swap Participant and Trade Option Exemption 
rules).  It is true we are a member of the NYMEX and subject to their rules 
but they relate almost exclusively to trading on the NYMEX.  It might be more 
helpful to talk to the guys in London about our SFA regulatory status.  We 
have quite a bit more supervision there than we do here in the states.

Mark, we are attempting to get a broad approval to trade any types of 
products in Australia through EnronOnline. (Currently our ability to trade 
products other electricity through EnronOnline using standardised 
documentation is not beyond doubt). What the Australian regulators are 
looking for is for us to point to a regulatory oversight in the US of Enron's 
trading activities. They hopefully then will back off. Particularly they want 
us to demonstrate  there are some prudential requirements Enron Corp. needs 
to meet in respect of trading activities. Pardon my complete ignorance but 
are there any? Would membership of NYMEX be relevant?

I have just had another call from ASIC (Alan Worseley and Tim Hardman).

It seems that there is a single significant policy concern for the ASIC
policy committee.

This arises because ASIC believes that a significantly wider range of
sophisticated counterparties will be interested in the EnronOnline products
(such as weather and credit) than those that are interested in Australian
electricity derivatives.  As a result, ASIC is not able to simply
"transfer-across" its approval of EAF under the electricity declaration
without separate consideration as to how EAF can meet the prudential
regulation criteria specified in PS 70.

They have asked for further information in this regard.  Obviously I
mentioned the presence of the Enron Corp guarantee. However, ASIC may
require something further, such as evidence of procedures in place to
prevent an Enron failure.  PS 70 states in this regard (in paragraphs 46 and
47):

 "The ASC considers that providers of safe harbour market facilities
should be subject to regulation which at least sets minimum capital
standards and ensures regular reporting against them. This is because the
financial stability of a facility provider is a crucial factor in the
stability of any market conducted by that provider. This will ensure that
risks associated with the conduct of a safe harbour market are monitored.
Standard setting and monitoring will contribute to the continued financial
stability of the facility provider. If the facility provider is a
significant participant in other markets, it will also help prevent any
adverse consequences for those markets if the facility provider fails.

 Regulatory supervision of this kind may occur in a number of ways.
For the purposes of the ASC's policy, it is not the identity of a
 particular supervisory authority that is important, but the fact
that the organisation is subject to supervision which produces the results
mentioned in para 46. Regulatory supervision will meet this test only if the
capital standards which it imposes on an organisation take into account the
organisation's derivatives market activities."

The following paragraphs are also explanatory, particularly as they refer to
certain US licensees.  Are any Enron entities subject to prudential or
similar regulation due to the licences/authorisations which they hold? This
could be a useful starting point.

They also mentioned that there may be difficulty in achieving the 23 June
timetable.  However, the focus of the discussion was the policy issue rather
than timing.

Sorry about the delay.  Here are my responses:
1.  Yes, this is primarily a tax issue.  However, there are some countries 
with strange laws regarding internet usage and we have covered some of those 
issues with specific PA provisions for those countries. 

2. No.  Only one user from each counterparty has to accept the GTC and that 
only the first time they trade that product.  The GTC's are arranged by 
"Product Type" so you only have to agree to it once for that type - 
regardless of how many products there are - so for example you only agree to 
the financial derivatives GTC once no matter how many different types of 
swaps and options you subsequently trade.

3. No.  But if that would be helpful it can be arranged.

4.  This one doesn't make much sense to me.  EnronOnline itself doesn't make 
any money.  There is no advertizing, and EnronOnline doesn't trade - the 
trades are all done by the various Enron trading entities.  EnronOnline is 
actually providing them a service.

5.  I really have no idea.  I guess we would have to print out the records 
and have one of the IT people testify that they had not been modified.

6. So far we haven't deleted anything.  If we need to keep the records for a 
long time we probably can but this has not been discussed.

		 Subject: EOL Survey

Two of the internet attorneys at Marval came over today to look at the system 
online.  They posed the following questions that I did not know the answer 
to.  Can you help me out on getting them a response today if possible?

1.  They would like to know the intent behind the sentence in Section (2) of 
the password application that prohibits the user form using the password 
outside their country.  I told them it was probably a tax driven issue but 
was not sure.

2.  They need to know if the user must scroll through and agree to the GTC 
each time they transact a trade.  I believe each product is represented by a 
separate line on the page and that each product has its own GTC even thought 
several related products will probably have identical GTCs.  I told them I 
thought that for each product that you only had to select it once, but that 
for each product, even if the GTC is the same as another produce you have 
reviewed, you must accept the GTC again.  Is this correct?

3.  Are the Enron trading entities signing service agreements with EOL for 
use of the system?

4.  They wanted to know if the trading entities providing the prices etc. for 
each product could be considered "content" for EOL and be considered value 
for which EOL should pay the trading entities.  I haven't heard of this issue 
before but I said I would ask.

5.  As a proof issue, what would be the process of proving and electronic 
trade?  How can we show we have not modified the screens or manipulated the 
data.  How would the data be presented to a court?  

6.  How long are the electronic trades retained in our systems and how are 
they retained?

Any help you can give me would be appreciated. 

Thanks,
Brent

Rosemary,

Should we limit the presentations to ISDA members only?  What about
FPML/Swift/Londex or e speed, or treasury connect, etc?  I believe we should 
try
to be inclusive of any important venture, member value from attendance goes up
as a result.

TLAB - Tellabs $85.94 (+11.63)(P3W $10.18)

Tellabs is quickly becoming a powerhouse in the Telecom
equipment industry. With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems,
and its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from
customers among the telephone companies, cable operators,
and government agencies.  Though they faded from news of
their failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major
player.

Wow!  What a play.  TLAB gave up only $0.44 in Thursday's
turmoil and came smokin' back $5.25 on Friday to close at
$85.94.  Technicals look outstanding with a small
consolidation already taken place; all indicators in
positive territory.  We introduced the play Thursday under
the following logic: TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78
on 11 million shares, $8 higher than resistance previously
set at $70.  TLAB drifted back to $74, then spiked $5 to
$79, on average volume of 3.5 million.  Over the previous 3
trading days, it gained in market weakness while giving
back only $.44 in heavy trading in a downright bearish
market - a terrific sign of strength.  3.5 million shares
traded daily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share
in cash; 34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.  We
expect them to announce more contracts in the coming weeks.
Recent news is capturing investors' eyeballs, making for a
good story.  We could find no news on Friday driving the
price; just market recovery and stock momentum.

Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised their rating to a
"buy" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35
and $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000,
respectively.  They further state, "fundamentals for the
telecom equipment group has improved over the past few
months which improves visibility for Tellabs" and "Our
checks with Tellabs will report fourth quarter 1998 results
slightly better than our $0.58 earnings per share estimate,
as well as having a positive outlook for 1999" (Reuters).
Also, rumors surfaced last week that TLAB was a targeted
buyout/merger candidate, but were quickly squashed.  Not
soon enough, though, to draw investor attention to the
price move.

QCOM - Qualcomm, Inc. $63.88 (+3.63)

QCOM develops, manufactures, markets, licenses, and operates
advanced communications systems and products based on digital
wireless technology. The Company's primary product areas are
the OmniTRACS system (a geostationary satellite-based,
mobile communications system providing two-way data and
position reporting services), CDMA wireless communications
systems and products and, in conjunction with others, the
development of the Globalstar low-earth-orbit (LEO)
satellite communications system.  The company's CDMA technology
has become the dominant wireless transmission standard in the
US and Korea, and is gaining momentum in a host of other
countries.  Demand for CDMA phones is surging as the US
wireless industry is migrating from analog to digital.

In the news last week, QCOM, along with several other
companies, purchased a concession to operate a fixed line
telephone service in Brazil.  QCOM has indicated, in the past,
that it is lobbying China to adopt its CDMA technology.  Since
1990, the average annual growth rate of mobile phone users in
China has been about 160%, according to government figures.
QCOM is building a global presence.  It was also reported on
CNBC on Friday that there is renewed interest in QCOM as a
takeover candidate given the recent acquisition of ATI and the
LU/ASND merger.  If fact, the entire sector is expecting
another round of takeovers given the competitive landscape.

QCOM has been in a basing pattern since last November.  It
actually fell below its 200 day moving average in December, and
then started its current run around the beginning of the year.
QCOM reports earnings on Tuesday just before the close.  As
you know we don't recommend holding over earnings releases, but
QCOM might make an interesting short term trade before the
earnings release.  Depending on the earnings release on
Tuesday, we also like QCOM as a play after the release given
the merger activity in the sector.  After the earnings release,
wait for a direction before initiating a play.

NOK.A  Nokia  $138.59 (+$3.59)

Nokia is a supplier of telecommunications systems and
equipment and is the world's leading maker of cellular
phones. It's telecommunications and mobile phone sales are
growing rapidly, and margins are higher as well. Nokia is
increasing plant capacity to keep up with demand.

We covered Nokia from Dec. 13th until Jan. 10th as both a
split candidate and a momentum play. It climbed steadily
for us into the first week of January, when the stock got
ahead of itself. It had risen a little too quickly due to
enthusiasm for the new Euro and to excitement over the ATI
bids. When it began pulling back from its $142.25 close on
Jan.6th, we feared a correction and became reluctant to
recommend new positions, so we dropped it. With yesterday's
$6.34 rebound, the correction appears to be over, and the
stock remains well above its moving averages, so we are
adding it back to our recommended plays. When NOKA
announced a split in Feb. 1998, a long and steep split run
followed. We have been unable to confirm the expected
earnings release date for this foreign owned stock, but we
will keep you posted, as that is a likely time for a new
split announcement.

Since we dropped it, Nokia has entered the pre-paid mobile
phone market in an agreement with Topp Telecom, Inc., of
Miami. Other recent news on this stock can still be found
in previous newsletters posted on the O.I. website. When
researching NOK.A, be aware that some sites require the dot
and some won't allow it.

MSFT - Microsoft $149.75 (-0.13)(+11.19)(-3.06)(P5W +28.13)

From their own words, "Microsoft Rules." Although it's
current reign is being rocked with revolution, the Evil M-
pire (as some programmers and anti-Internet Explorer
browser patriots call it), has been fighting the Federal
government on anti-trust grounds for months. The line to
take their turn and bad mouth the bully was long and
distinguished. The fact is, MSFT is good at what they do.
They are the world's #1 software company (Y2K compliant or
not!) and their operating systems dominate the PC
landscape.

Extremely volatile, but almost no change from the previous
week.  Price range last week was $136 to $150 on above
average volume for 4 of 5 trading days.  Friday gave us an
$8 gain following the Brazilian downdraft.  CS First Boston
said Microsoft "appears on track" to meet or beat estimate
of 60 cents per share - an increase of 46 percent from the
42 cents in the same quarter last year.  Sales are expected
to increase 21 percent to $4.3 billion.  With conviction,
we still predict a stock split with the earnings
announcement after the close January 19th (MSFT confirmed
this date); only 1 trading day away.  Historically, MSFT
has split like clockwork at $140.  MSFT has expressed
optimism about their future and has every reason to split
the stock.  MSFT is trading just $3 off its all-time high
of $152.50, set the previous week.  Prudential last week
set a price target of $175.  We think their relative price
compared to the market reflects strong investor confidence.
A great play in the making.

Unsavory news release late Thursday: A federal judge
scolded Microsoft Corp. over new contract language
requiring temporary workers to waive any awards from a
pending lawsuit over the software giant's employment
practices (Reuters).  It had no affect on the stock, but
raised eyebrows in the PR department.  Conversely, a new
Microsoft poll shows that 76 percent of American consumers
believe that Microsoft has benefited both U.S. consumers
and the computer software industry (Reuters).  The real
surprise was another press release stating Robert Bork
believes Microsoft should be broken into 3 companies; an
unusual comment from a free market champion, until you
realize he's paid by Netscape to represent them in the
Justice Departments case.  Finally, MSFT appealed the Sun-
Java infringement injunction citing that it believes the
court mistakenly treated the case filed against it by Sun
as a copyright issue, rather than a contract dispute.  We
reiterate, "no material effect on earnings".  Everen
Securities still has their price targets(0-6 months) of
$161 and their long term (6-18 months) of $200

CHKPF  Check Point Software $51.25 (+4.37)(+1.07)

Network break-ins get doused with Check Point Software
Technologies' firewall products -- software that protects
corporate networks from unauthorized access, from both
inside and outside the company. FireWall-1 authenticates
remote users, controls access, and blocks viruses and other
undesirable Web content. Its FloodGate-1 clears up traffic
congestion on crowded Internet and intranet links by
allocating available space to company-defined uses. Check
Point's largest customer is Sun Microsystems' SunSoft, which
accounts for about 20% of sales. Check Point operates
subsidiaries in Europe, North America, and the Pacific Rim.

CHKPF is a company that benefits from the explosion in the
Internet.  As companies increase their use of the web, CHKPF's
services will be needed more and more.  CHKPF has an incredible
record of earning surprises.  Next earnings are scheduled for
January 21st.  Holding over earnings is a risky proposition, but
for those risk takers out there, it might pay off.  There is a
possibility that CHKPF might announce a stock split.  They have
plenty of shares, but have never announced a split in the past.
MACD is positive and CHKPF price is above all moving averages.
Between Tuesday and earnings after the close on Thursday, CHKPF
could have a nice run.

CHKPF, along with other networking security companies, will be
holding a seminar in February. This seminar will outline the
future of the business and the strategies these companies use
and how they can help other companies with their information
security. CHKPF has a consensus growth rate of 37.55%. Watch
for a pullback and hang on for the ride.

PRIA  PRI Automation, INC. $34.50 (+4.87)

PRIA designs, develops, manufactures, and markets factory
automation systems for the cleanroom manufacturing
operations of semi-conductor makers and OEM equipment
suppliers. Last year's $178.2 million in revenues reflect
the big downturn in the semi-conductor industry, but that
is changing. The 1998 glut of chips has been depleted, and
demand is strong again for these products.

After hitting a high of $37.50 in Feb. 1998, PRIA stock had
lost about 75% of its value by the time the market bottomed
in October. However, it has been climbing fairly steadily
ever since, except for a brief correction in December. With
the chip industry recovering, it follows that a company
such as PRIA will benefit. On January 12th, CIBC Oppenheimer
upgraded PRIA to strong buy from buy. This as a momentum
play in an improving industry.  Earnings due out Jan. 28th.

MU  Micron Technology  $71.31 (+7.68)

Micron makes semi-conductor memory products, PCs, circuit
boards, memory modules, and system level assemblies, and
has a market cap. of $17.6 billion.  Revenues for MU=20
declined last year due to lower selling prices of PCs and
semi-conductor products. This was a result of too much
product industry wide and too little demand, but the
company is recovering now, as demand increases.

With the industry gaining steam, market expectations for
Micron's earnings were high in December, and the stock
pulled back when MU did not beat analysts' earnings by a
wide enough margin. However, MU has lately begun climbing
again and gathering momentum. Even in this past week's down
market, the stock looked fairly strong. Chip prices climbed
6% last week as Koreans permanently slashed production and
may actually swing the market from an overproduction last
year to a scarcity in the coming year. The wild card in the
future supply is Taiwan. Already, though, chip prices,
which were $200 a year ago, and fell below $60 in May, have
climbed to near $90. At the same time, sales for PCs and
the chips that go in them are showing strong increases, and
that will eventually show up in MU's bottom line. This is a
momentum play.

CBS Marketwatch screened stocks for 20 different
characteristics and MU turned out in the top group. The
five best characteristics: 1)Strong recent earnings/revenue
growth, 2)Selling at a discount to its growth,
3)Consistently beats analysts expectations, 4)Earnings
estimates continually revised upwards, 5)Short- and long-
term relative strength.

JBL - Jabil Circuit, Inc. $73.88 (-1.00)(+.38)(+2.94)(+3.06)

JBL is the third-largest US manufacturer of circuit board
systems, trailing SCI Systems and Solectron. The company's
products are used in PCs, printers, network hardware, cellular
phones, and cars. JBL's major customers include Hewlett
Packard, 3Com, and Cisco Systems with more than half of its
revenues coming from telecommunications companies.  JBL's
customers use contract manufacturers, like JBL, to save money
and improve production times.  JBL has manufacturing facilities
in Malaysia, Mexico, the UK, and the US.  Insiders own
approximately 41% of the company.

In the news last week, Everen Securities initiated coverage on
JBL with an intermediate term market perform and a long term
outperform.  The press release did note, that in the near-term
they believe that JBL is close to fair value, but in the long
term it should be an outperformer.  The other bit of news that
helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for one
stock split.  As we have said on more than one occasion, this
industry tends to move together.

Last week, JBL bounced off of its 21 day moving average and
closed right at its 10 day moving average on Friday.  There
also appears to be some support for JBL around $71.  JBL
has been on extended run since last September, and given the
way the sector goes in and out of favor with the Street, you
should keep a close eye on JBL if you are playing it.  If JBL
were to break below $71, in a significant way, we would be very
cautious of the stock.  Also, as with any sector, but more so
with this one, you have to keep an eye on the sector when
playing JBL.

LXK  Lexmark Intl. $98.06 (-2.50)(+.06)(+7.25)(+1.31)

Lexmark has good peripheral vision. Lexmark International
Group is a leading maker of computer printers and related
products, which generate more than 80% of its sales. Its
printer line includes laser printers (designed primarily
for corporate networks and desktops) and ink-jet printers
(for home and business use). Unlike many of its competitors,
Lexmark develops and manufactures it's own printers, which
results in fast product cycle times. The company also makes
supplies for IBM and other name brand printers and typewriters.
Lexmark's products are sold in more than 15,000 retail outlets
in more than 150 countries.

LXK consolidated this last week and is sitting right on its
20-dma. We still like LXK with earnings on the 26th of January.
Remember, holding over earnings is risky. In the case of LXK,
the risk might be justified if they announce a stock split.
Each individual has to weigh out the risk themselves.

LXK hasn't had any news the last few days. These last few
weeks have seen LXK get recommended by many different
professionals as a great stock to own for 1999. Remember,
LXK has had an average earnings surprise of 11.75% over the
last four quarters. This could help propel LXK higher before
earnings on the expectation. There are different earnings dates
listed on the web, but First Call does list the 26th of January.
We will continue to try to get a fixed date from investor
relations.

EMC - EMC Corporation $100.06 (+6.50)(+8.56)(+3.38)(+.13)

EMC is a Fortune 500 company that designs, manufactures,
markets an supports high performance storage products.  The
company's products store retrieve, manage, protect and share
information from all major computing environments, including
UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe platforms.  EMC markets its
memory products under the name Symmetrix.  EMC and its
enterprise storage systems have developed a clear cut
technological edge over its competition.  The company has been
able to successfully leverage its leadership position in the
mainframe storage area into the lucrative, faster growing open
systems market.

There really wasn't any news last week on EMC.  We think the
real story happened on Thursday, when the NASDAQ was down and
EMC went up.  This suggests that there are still a lot of
buyers who want EMC stock.  This was confirmed by the move EMC
made on Friday.  We continue to read  articles that discuss EMC
being in model portfolios of 20 to 30 growth stocks.  There was
an article in MSN MoneyCentral about EMC being one of the top
30 growth stocks.  EMC has been, and is continuing to be, a
great momentum stock.

EMC took off again on Friday.  It set a new 52 week high on
Friday, and closed near the high.  As we discussed above, EMC
is one of those stocks that people keep buying.  As long as
there are buyers of the stock, we believe it will continue with
it's momentum.  EMC is also a split candidate.  We know we keep
saying this, but as it continues to move up, it only increases
the probability of a split.  A year ago this last November EMC
split at around $63 after a strong move.  FYI - EMC reports
earnings before the open on 1/26.

XIRC  Xircom Inc. $39.88 (+1.38)(+4.50)(+1.25)

Xircom makes adapters that connect portable PCs to corporate
networks, the Internet, and commercial online services. The
company's products include adapter/modem cards (CreditCard
Ethernet+Modem), network adapters for portable PCs (Pocket
Ethernet Adapter, Pocket Token Ring Adapter), and modem-only
PC cards (CreditCard Modem). Xircom sells its products to
original equipment manufacturers and through a worldwide
network of distributors, value-added resellers, and computer
retailers. Over half of its income is from foreign sales.
Intel owns 11% of Xircom; chairman and CEO Dirk Gates owns
about 5%.

XIRC is expecting to announce earnings that are 300% higher
than the same quarter last year.  With the large earning
surprises XIRC has had the last four quarter, a nice run
could develop into earnings. Though a split isn't likely,
the company has enough shares to announced one. There is
no split history for XIRC.  XIRC reached a new 52-week high
on Friday when it hit $40.50.

XIRC was recently selected as one of the best mobile PC cards.
Its product will be competing with 3COM and a few others for
the best mobile PC card.  This award ceremony is put on the
Mobility Awards. 3COM is one of the biggest competitors of XIRC.

TLAB - Tellabs $85.94 (+11.63)(P3W $10.18)

Tellabs is quickly becoming a powerhouse in the Telecom
equipment industry. With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems,
and its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from
customers among the telephone companies, cable operators,
and government agencies.  Though they faded from news of
their failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major
player.

Wow!  What a play.  TLAB gave up only $0.44 in Thursday's
turmoil and came smokin' back $5.25 on Friday to close at
$85.94.  Technicals look outstanding with a small
consolidation already taken place; all indicators in
positive territory.  We introduced the play Thursday under
the following logic: TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78
on 11 million shares, $8 higher than resistance previously
set at $70.  TLAB drifted back to $74, then spiked $5 to
$79, on average volume of 3.5 million.  Over the previous 3
trading days, it gained in market weakness while giving
back only $.44 in heavy trading in a downright bearish
market - a terrific sign of strength.  3.5 million shares
traded daily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share
in cash; 34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.  We
expect them to announce more contracts in the coming weeks.
Recent news is capturing investors' eyeballs, making for a
good story.  We could find no news on Friday driving the
price; just market recovery and stock momentum.

Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised their rating to a
"buy" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35
and $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000,
respectively.  They further state, "fundamentals for the
telecom equipment group has improved over the past few
months which improves visibility for Tellabs" and "Our
checks with Tellabs will report fourth quarter 1998 results
slightly better than our $0.58 earnings per share estimate,
as well as having a positive outlook for 1999" (Reuters).
Also, rumors surfaced last week that TLAB was a targeted
buyout/merger candidate, but were quickly squashed.  Not
soon enough, though, to draw investor attention to the
price move.

QCOM - Qualcomm, Inc. $63.88 (+3.63)

QCOM develops, manufactures, markets, licenses, and operates
advanced communications systems and products based on digital
wireless technology. The Company's primary product areas are
the OmniTRACS system (a geostationary satellite-based,
mobile communications system providing two-way data and
position reporting services), CDMA wireless communications
systems and products and, in conjunction with others, the
development of the Globalstar low-earth-orbit (LEO)
satellite communications system.  The company's CDMA technology
has become the dominant wireless transmission standard in the
US and Korea, and is gaining momentum in a host of other
countries.  Demand for CDMA phones is surging as the US
wireless industry is migrating from analog to digital.

In the news last week, QCOM, along with several other
companies, purchased a concession to operate a fixed line
telephone service in Brazil.  QCOM has indicated, in the past,
that it is lobbying China to adopt its CDMA technology.  Since
1990, the average annual growth rate of mobile phone users in
China has been about 160%, according to government figures.
QCOM is building a global presence.  It was also reported on
CNBC on Friday that there is renewed interest in QCOM as a
takeover candidate given the recent acquisition of ATI and the
LU/ASND merger.  If fact, the entire sector is expecting
another round of takeovers given the competitive landscape.

QCOM has been in a basing pattern since last November.  It
actually fell below its 200 day moving average in December, and
then started its current run around the beginning of the year.
QCOM reports earnings on Tuesday just before the close.  As
you know we don't recommend holding over earnings releases, but
QCOM might make an interesting short term trade before the
earnings release.  Depending on the earnings release on
Tuesday, we also like QCOM as a play after the release given
the merger activity in the sector.  After the earnings release,
wait for a direction before initiating a play.

NOK.A  Nokia  $138.59 (+$3.59)

Nokia is a supplier of telecommunications systems and
equipment and is the world's leading maker of cellular
phones. It's telecommunications and mobile phone sales are
growing rapidly, and margins are higher as well. Nokia is
increasing plant capacity to keep up with demand.

We covered Nokia from Dec. 13th until Jan. 10th as both a
split candidate and a momentum play. It climbed steadily
for us into the first week of January, when the stock got
ahead of itself. It had risen a little too quickly due to
enthusiasm for the new Euro and to excitement over the ATI
bids. When it began pulling back from its $142.25 close on
Jan.6th, we feared a correction and became reluctant to
recommend new positions, so we dropped it. With yesterday's
$6.34 rebound, the correction appears to be over, and the
stock remains well above its moving averages, so we are
adding it back to our recommended plays. When NOKA
announced a split in Feb. 1998, a long and steep split run
followed. We have been unable to confirm the expected
earnings release date for this foreign owned stock, but we
will keep you posted, as that is a likely time for a new
split announcement.

Since we dropped it, Nokia has entered the pre-paid mobile
phone market in an agreement with Topp Telecom, Inc., of
Miami. Other recent news on this stock can still be found
in previous newsletters posted on the O.I. website. When
researching NOK.A, be aware that some sites require the dot
and some won't allow it.

MSFT - Microsoft $149.75 (-0.13)(+11.19)(-3.06)(P5W +28.13)

From their own words, "Microsoft Rules." Although it's
current reign is being rocked with revolution, the Evil M-
pire (as some programmers and anti-Internet Explorer
browser patriots call it), has been fighting the Federal
government on anti-trust grounds for months. The line to
take their turn and bad mouth the bully was long and
distinguished. The fact is, MSFT is good at what they do.
They are the world's #1 software company (Y2K compliant or
not!) and their operating systems dominate the PC
landscape.

Extremely volatile, but almost no change from the previous
week.  Price range last week was $136 to $150 on above
average volume for 4 of 5 trading days.  Friday gave us an
$8 gain following the Brazilian downdraft.  CS First Boston
said Microsoft "appears on track" to meet or beat estimate
of 60 cents per share - an increase of 46 percent from the
42 cents in the same quarter last year.  Sales are expected
to increase 21 percent to $4.3 billion.  With conviction,
we still predict a stock split with the earnings
announcement after the close January 19th (MSFT confirmed
this date); only 1 trading day away.  Historically, MSFT
has split like clockwork at $140.  MSFT has expressed
optimism about their future and has every reason to split
the stock.  MSFT is trading just $3 off its all-time high
of $152.50, set the previous week.  Prudential last week
set a price target of $175.  We think their relative price
compared to the market reflects strong investor confidence.
A great play in the making.

Unsavory news release late Thursday: A federal judge
scolded Microsoft Corp. over new contract language
requiring temporary workers to waive any awards from a
pending lawsuit over the software giant's employment
practices (Reuters).  It had no affect on the stock, but
raised eyebrows in the PR department.  Conversely, a new
Microsoft poll shows that 76 percent of American consumers
believe that Microsoft has benefited both U.S. consumers
and the computer software industry (Reuters).  The real
surprise was another press release stating Robert Bork
believes Microsoft should be broken into 3 companies; an
unusual comment from a free market champion, until you
realize he's paid by Netscape to represent them in the
Justice Departments case.  Finally, MSFT appealed the Sun-
Java infringement injunction citing that it believes the
court mistakenly treated the case filed against it by Sun
as a copyright issue, rather than a contract dispute.  We
reiterate, "no material effect on earnings".  Everen
Securities still has their price targets(0-6 months) of
$161 and their long term (6-18 months) of $200

CHKPF  Check Point Software $51.25 (+4.37)(+1.07)

Network break-ins get doused with Check Point Software
Technologies' firewall products -- software that protects
corporate networks from unauthorized access, from both
inside and outside the company. FireWall-1 authenticates
remote users, controls access, and blocks viruses and other
undesirable Web content. Its FloodGate-1 clears up traffic
congestion on crowded Internet and intranet links by
allocating available space to company-defined uses. Check
Point's largest customer is Sun Microsystems' SunSoft, which
accounts for about 20% of sales. Check Point operates
subsidiaries in Europe, North America, and the Pacific Rim.

CHKPF is a company that benefits from the explosion in the
Internet.  As companies increase their use of the web, CHKPF's
services will be needed more and more.  CHKPF has an incredible
record of earning surprises.  Next earnings are scheduled for
January 21st.  Holding over earnings is a risky proposition, but
for those risk takers out there, it might pay off.  There is a
possibility that CHKPF might announce a stock split.  They have
plenty of shares, but have never announced a split in the past.
MACD is positive and CHKPF price is above all moving averages.
Between Tuesday and earnings after the close on Thursday, CHKPF
could have a nice run.

CHKPF, along with other networking security companies, will be
holding a seminar in February. This seminar will outline the
future of the business and the strategies these companies use
and how they can help other companies with their information
security. CHKPF has a consensus growth rate of 37.55%. Watch
for a pullback and hang on for the ride.

PRIA  PRI Automation, INC. $34.50 (+4.87)

PRIA designs, develops, manufactures, and markets factory
automation systems for the cleanroom manufacturing
operations of semi-conductor makers and OEM equipment
suppliers. Last year's $178.2 million in revenues reflect
the big downturn in the semi-conductor industry, but that
is changing. The 1998 glut of chips has been depleted, and
demand is strong again for these products.

After hitting a high of $37.50 in Feb. 1998, PRIA stock had
lost about 75% of its value by the time the market bottomed
in October. However, it has been climbing fairly steadily
ever since, except for a brief correction in December. With
the chip industry recovering, it follows that a company
such as PRIA will benefit. On January 12th, CIBC Oppenheimer
upgraded PRIA to strong buy from buy. This as a momentum
play in an improving industry.  Earnings due out Jan. 28th.

MU  Micron Technology  $71.31 (+7.68)

Micron makes semi-conductor memory products, PCs, circuit
boards, memory modules, and system level assemblies, and
has a market cap. of $17.6 billion.  Revenues for MU=20
declined last year due to lower selling prices of PCs and
semi-conductor products. This was a result of too much
product industry wide and too little demand, but the
company is recovering now, as demand increases.

With the industry gaining steam, market expectations for
Micron's earnings were high in December, and the stock
pulled back when MU did not beat analysts' earnings by a
wide enough margin. However, MU has lately begun climbing
again and gathering momentum. Even in this past week's down
market, the stock looked fairly strong. Chip prices climbed
6% last week as Koreans permanently slashed production and
may actually swing the market from an overproduction last
year to a scarcity in the coming year. The wild card in the
future supply is Taiwan. Already, though, chip prices,
which were $200 a year ago, and fell below $60 in May, have
climbed to near $90. At the same time, sales for PCs and
the chips that go in them are showing strong increases, and
that will eventually show up in MU's bottom line. This is a
momentum play.

CBS Marketwatch screened stocks for 20 different
characteristics and MU turned out in the top group. The
five best characteristics: 1)Strong recent earnings/revenue
growth, 2)Selling at a discount to its growth,
3)Consistently beats analysts expectations, 4)Earnings
estimates continually revised upwards, 5)Short- and long-
term relative strength.

JBL - Jabil Circuit, Inc. $73.88 (-1.00)(+.38)(+2.94)(+3.06)

JBL is the third-largest US manufacturer of circuit board
systems, trailing SCI Systems and Solectron. The company's
products are used in PCs, printers, network hardware, cellular
phones, and cars. JBL's major customers include Hewlett
Packard, 3Com, and Cisco Systems with more than half of its
revenues coming from telecommunications companies.  JBL's
customers use contract manufacturers, like JBL, to save money
and improve production times.  JBL has manufacturing facilities
in Malaysia, Mexico, the UK, and the US.  Insiders own
approximately 41% of the company.

In the news last week, Everen Securities initiated coverage on
JBL with an intermediate term market perform and a long term
outperform.  The press release did note, that in the near-term
they believe that JBL is close to fair value, but in the long
term it should be an outperformer.  The other bit of news that
helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for one
stock split.  As we have said on more than one occasion, this
industry tends to move together.

Last week, JBL bounced off of its 21 day moving average and
closed right at its 10 day moving average on Friday.  There
also appears to be some support for JBL around $71.  JBL
has been on extended run since last September, and given the
way the sector goes in and out of favor with the Street, you
should keep a close eye on JBL if you are playing it.  If JBL
were to break below $71, in a significant way, we would be very
cautious of the stock.  Also, as with any sector, but more so
with this one, you have to keep an eye on the sector when
playing JBL.

LXK  Lexmark Intl. $98.06 (-2.50)(+.06)(+7.25)(+1.31)

Lexmark has good peripheral vision. Lexmark International
Group is a leading maker of computer printers and related
products, which generate more than 80% of its sales. Its
printer line includes laser printers (designed primarily
for corporate networks and desktops) and ink-jet printers
(for home and business use). Unlike many of its competitors,
Lexmark develops and manufactures it's own printers, which
results in fast product cycle times. The company also makes
supplies for IBM and other name brand printers and typewriters.
Lexmark's products are sold in more than 15,000 retail outlets
in more than 150 countries.

LXK consolidated this last week and is sitting right on its
20-dma. We still like LXK with earnings on the 26th of January.
Remember, holding over earnings is risky. In the case of LXK,
the risk might be justified if they announce a stock split.
Each individual has to weigh out the risk themselves.

LXK hasn't had any news the last few days. These last few
weeks have seen LXK get recommended by many different
professionals as a great stock to own for 1999. Remember,
LXK has had an average earnings surprise of 11.75% over the
last four quarters. This could help propel LXK higher before
earnings on the expectation. There are different earnings dates
listed on the web, but First Call does list the 26th of January.
We will continue to try to get a fixed date from investor
relations.

EMC - EMC Corporation $100.06 (+6.50)(+8.56)(+3.38)(+.13)

EMC is a Fortune 500 company that designs, manufactures,
markets an supports high performance storage products.  The
company's products store retrieve, manage, protect and share
information from all major computing environments, including
UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe platforms.  EMC markets its
memory products under the name Symmetrix.  EMC and its
enterprise storage systems have developed a clear cut
technological edge over its competition.  The company has been
able to successfully leverage its leadership position in the
mainframe storage area into the lucrative, faster growing open
systems market.

There really wasn't any news last week on EMC.  We think the
real story happened on Thursday, when the NASDAQ was down and
EMC went up.  This suggests that there are still a lot of
buyers who want EMC stock.  This was confirmed by the move EMC
made on Friday.  We continue to read  articles that discuss EMC
being in model portfolios of 20 to 30 growth stocks.  There was
an article in MSN MoneyCentral about EMC being one of the top
30 growth stocks.  EMC has been, and is continuing to be, a
great momentum stock.

EMC took off again on Friday.  It set a new 52 week high on
Friday, and closed near the high.  As we discussed above, EMC
is one of those stocks that people keep buying.  As long as
there are buyers of the stock, we believe it will continue with
it's momentum.  EMC is also a split candidate.  We know we keep
saying this, but as it continues to move up, it only increases
the probability of a split.  A year ago this last November EMC
split at around $63 after a strong move.  FYI - EMC reports
earnings before the open on 1/26.

XIRC  Xircom Inc. $39.88 (+1.38)(+4.50)(+1.25)

Xircom makes adapters that connect portable PCs to corporate
networks, the Internet, and commercial online services. The
company's products include adapter/modem cards (CreditCard
Ethernet+Modem), network adapters for portable PCs (Pocket
Ethernet Adapter, Pocket Token Ring Adapter), and modem-only
PC cards (CreditCard Modem). Xircom sells its products to
original equipment manufacturers and through a worldwide
network of distributors, value-added resellers, and computer
retailers. Over half of its income is from foreign sales.
Intel owns 11% of Xircom; chairman and CEO Dirk Gates owns
about 5%.

XIRC is expecting to announce earnings that are 300% higher
than the same quarter last year.  With the large earning
surprises XIRC has had the last four quarter, a nice run
could develop into earnings. Though a split isn't likely,
the company has enough shares to announced one. There is
no split history for XIRC.  XIRC reached a new 52-week high
on Friday when it hit $40.50.

XIRC was recently selected as one of the best mobile PC cards.
Its product will be competing with 3COM and a few others for
the best mobile PC card.  This award ceremony is put on the
Mobility Awards. 3COM is one of the biggest competitors of XIRC.

Trading lessons...

This week we are going discuss one of the many pitfalls that you
will eventually encounter as a trader; Incorrect Information...

Occasionally, we will discover an error in a stock or option quote
and usually it comes to us "the hard way". Last week, we offered
a position on Reliance Bancorp (RELY) and it turns out that the
option quoted was for another stock. It was not a research error
or miss-type, just erroneous quote information provided to the
trading public. One of our faithful readers had the unfortunate
experience of buying into this play on the assumption that the
option existed. We received permission to reprint portions of his
remarks to educate our readers. Here is the general narrative;

"I did my 'due diligence' on the options play with Reliance
Bancorp but like a growing number of people this was all handled
on-line with me as the only human in the food chain willing to
take any chances. Oddly though, I did speak to two other people
in this and got an interesting mix of answers.

I used (two common brokerages; names deleted) for my information,
perhaps using two separate entities was my downfall here. One
stated just as you did that there was a Reliance, FEB25-Call at
the same bid as you published. If fact, it showed an array of
options for Reliance. However, come to find out they were Verio.

I then bought shares of Reliance on-line through another broker in
my IRA with the intention of selling calls against them the next
day. When I entered the ticker symbol to 'sell calls to open', I
was greeted by a statement about Verio. Calling the broker, I was
told that the ticker symbol was in fact for Verio but only the Feb.
call. I then contacted the option trading desk and found that the
ticker symbol belonged to Verio and there were no options on RELY
at all. I was fooled by the apparent presence of options at one
brokerage, which tells me that I need to do all my research
through the top name brokerage."

The reader went on to point out that; "It turned out to be the
systems that were fouled up and not the analysis, all information
that is received on-line or through humans should be verified
before investing...I sure plan to do so from now on!"

Words of wisdom for sure!

-ROI is equal to the profit (or loss) divided by the cost-basis.
 Monthly ROI represents the return on a monthly basis.
 Example: a 10% return in 20 days equals 15.2% ROI for a month).
-Margin is not used in any calculations.
-Profit/Loss Column: Asterisk indicates stock price above strike
 price and should be called.  Stock that will not be called is
 assumed sold at current price (for tracking purposes).

*** LOSING PLAYS ***

Determining when to exit a play is a matter of personal preference
but we strongly recommended closing any play that falls more than
20% below the initial cost-basis. Some positions may eventually
become profitable but it is generally more productive to exit a
losing play and move your capital into another prospective trade.

rose 14% to $44.6 million. Recently awarded an outsourcing
project valued at several million dollars. Recovered quickly
from Wednesday's market induced drop and quickly surged to a new
52 week high.  Strong technicals suggest that SPNSF is ready to
rally!

NAKED PUT SECTION FOR JANUARY 17, 1999
******************************************************************
This month, the naked-put portfolio performed very well. Most of
the success was due to the January effect and the bullish movement
of the market after the new year's holiday. Some of the more
successful plays were Internet and Pharmaceutical positions. In
fact, a number of Internet stocks continue to climb as if the sky
had no ceiling. We did have one negative position. Zila fell on
news that Federal advisers recommended against approval of Oratest,
a test to help see cancerous lesions in the mouth. The play should
have been closed for a $0.75 loss.

Brazilian woes continue...

The market is being subdued by the deteriorating situation in
Brazil and no one knows whether this virus will spread like the
Asian Flu. It all stems from the fact that the current world
markets are very susceptible to global meltdown and the closest
thing to a controlling entity is the US government. A serious
situation like the South American financial turmoil won't go away
quickly and although the floating of the Brazilian 'real' should
help the situation in the short-term, it may not prevent trouble
from spreading to other countries. Our economy has never been out
of control but we now face a period of potentially disappointing
earnings reports which will definitely have an effect on the U.S.
stock market in the coming weeks. Good Luck!

PTVL - Preview Travel  $22.50

PTVL is a provider of branded online travel services for leisure
and small business travelers. Preview Travel has been in a stage
I base since October. Recently corrected after a quick doubling
in price due to the Internet craze. Gaining notice with coverage
initiated by Friedman Billings and now Warburg Dillon Reid. Good
bullish potential with stock above 150 dma and support near $15.

SCUR - Secure Computing  $26.00

Secure Computing Corporation designs, develops, markets and sells
complete network security solutions, including firewalls, filters,
authentication and network services. Earnings are due shortly and
the whisper number is moving higher. SCUR is expected to maintain
a 30-50% growth rate and now option interest is increasing with
rumors of a stock split. Paine Webber reiterated "BUY" rating with
a conservative target of $30.

SDTI - Security Dynamics  $27.63

SDTI provides enterprise network and data security solutions.
The recent lawsuits have been forgotten and analyst upgrades
have had a positive effect. The company started a market trial
program of higher levels of security for customers like IBM and
introduced SecurWorld for delivering two-factor authentication.
A good technical play with Internet bias. Stock price is trading
above all recent resistance and the current trend is bullish.

SMOD - Smart Modular  $25.38

SMOD designs, manufactures and markets memory modules, personal
computer card products and embedded processor modules for the
telecommunication, computer and networking industries. Experts
say the sector is already grappling with the specter of a supply
crunch for DRAM devices. Brisk demand from PC makers may cause a
severe shortage that will result in excessively high premiums for
the technology. We prefer to play based on the support near $20.

SPLN - Sportsline  $31.13

Sportsline USA, Inc. is an Internet-based sports media company
that provides branded, interactive information and programming
as well as merchandise to sports enthusiasts worldwide. Some say
its #1 in sports information on the Internet and more rumors of
a target-price upgrade. The new issue of the Dines Letter rates
SPLN as one of 4 top Internet stocks to buy now! A steady climb
since mid-Oct and a recent gap-up when the company said it will
post outstanding Q4 revenues, up 90% from a year ago. CBS's new
record-breaking IPO (Marketwatch.com) probably helps this one!

SRCM is a provider of information and programming through
the company's proprietary digital operating systems to mass
market consumers. Customers subscribe to Source Media audio
content and have it featured on their web site. The company
launched audio programming with Broadcast.com and says the
Internet audio means it has content on PC's, cable TV and
telephones. A rumored deal with American Online may also be
causing some of the buying pressure and the stock has good
technical support around $15.

VIRS - Triangle Pharm.  $14.13

Triangle Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company engaged
in the development of new drug candidates primarily in the
antiviral area. Still playing this stock again as it has exited
the tip of the isosceles triangle formation and started to move
higher. Dec 15 entered into definitive purchase agreements to
sell 4.8m newly issued shares of stock to selected investors for
a price of $10. Technically still neutral (basing) to bullish.

common stock to a current institutional shareholder at a premium,
thus eliminating any near term financing issues. Also provided a
warrant to the investor to acquire an additional 250,000 shares
at $10.66. The funds will be used for working capital and should
fund existing operations beyond 1999. Good support around $8.

PICKS WE DROPPED THIS WEEK
*****************************************
Remember that historically, when we drop a pick it will go up
10 to 15% the very next week. It is part of Murphy's Law.
Just because we drop a stock as a pick does not mean we are
advocating a "sell" on any position you have. We are simply
dropping our recommendation as a new play. Existing plays
can and do continue on and are usually profitable.
*****************************************

CALLS:

LOW $50.63(-4.06) We are dropping LOW this week. They have
taken a fall and we don't see any catalyst to continue the
move up.  LOW's has had a nice run. Earnings aren't until
February and we feel there are other picks that will out-
perform.  We are not saying those holding LOW's should sell,
every investor makes their own decision, we just feel it
isn't worthy of a new purchase at this point.

PUTS:

CBE - Cooper Industries  $44.81  (2.69)
Stock rallied sharply on Friday (1/15) after retesting prior
support at $43. Pinnacle dropping CBE after reaching price

NETWORKING - Sector
***************************************
CSCO - Cisco Systems $101.69 (-5.00)(+13.88)(-1.38)(P6W +29.49)

Cisco is the leading networker and is expected to help
build the next generation Internet. Their goal is to allow
people to access or transfer information without regard to
differences in time, place or type of computer systems,
voice or data.  About 85% of the routers used to decipher
and direct data traffic on the Internet are made by Cisco.

Panic, over-reaction, reality. That best describes CSCO's
trade pattern last week.  We're adding CSCO back after
dropping it from Tuesday's publication.  The market
realized that Lucent's acquisition of Ascend is not the end
of the world for CSCO, sending CSCO back up from its knee-
jerk/market induced sell off. "Often it's the very best
employees who approach Cisco after a takeover.  "That's
wonderful for us and bad for the other guy," said Larry
Lang of CSCO's business services division.  CSCO will
provide the equipment needed for AT&T to offer
TV/phone/internet/data services through (what will be) it's
TCI division.  CSCO is truly leading the development of the
Internet by helping cable and phone companies complete "the
last mile", or the distance between the cable in the street
an your home.  Also making news, this from Newswire, "Cisco
Systems to Invest $6 Million in Technical Support for
China; Technical Assistance Center and Additional Support
Options to Benefit Channel Partners and Customers."

The big picture is that CSCO is due for another split now
that the price is over $100.  Historically, their split
range is $80-$100.  While they have enough shares
outstanding to complete another 3:2 split, a 2:1 would
require the shareholder's to approve more shares.  Next
earnings announcement is scheduled for 2/2 (company
verified); perhaps then we'll get the announcement.  Though
up to $108 the week before, CSCO couldn't hold the gains and
fell with LU/ASND and Brazil news.  Nice recovery back over
$101 on Friday after falling as low as $89 in Wednesday's
sell-off.  A better entry is now available.  Look for
market direction and make your move.

AOL - America Online $146.50 (+0.00)(-8.63)(+18.50)(P5W+65.06)

America Online is the largest online Internet access
service in the world.  Membership now exceeds 15 million
users.  Its Chairman, Steve Case, said more new users
signed up with AOL on Christmas Day than any other day in
the company's history.  With estimates of 16 million users
by the year 2000 and growing advertising revenues AOL has
been called the blue chip of the Internets. (If only they
could get their mail problem resolved!)

Given Internet weakness last week, it's a wonder AOL
finished even from the previous week.  AOL traded between
$130.00 and $167.  What action!  It finished Friday up
$2.00 on light volume, faring well against significant
losses on other 1st tier Internet stocks.  Consolidation may
be nearing an end as we approach earnings.  At these price
levels, AOL is again well over its historical $120 split
range, though rumors seem to have died for an immediate
announcement.  Currently they have 1.8 bln shares
authorized.  That's enough for a 3:1 split, but a 2:1 is
more likely.  Earnings are on January 27th (company
confirmed).  Look for the split announcement then along
with surprise earnings (as usual).  For the next couple of
days, target shooting your entry may be a safer play.  As
always, confirm market direction first.

Making news this week, AOL stated they expect to close the
Netscape deal by the end of April.  Also, they are
partnering a deal with Bell Atlantic to bring AOL service
at DSL speeds (Digital Subscriber Line-1.5 megs of
bandwidth) to Bell Atlantic customers, putting them in
competition with @Home, another successful cable internet
access service.  DSL service could be available by mid-
Summer (at less than $20 additional per month) and will
cover 15 million homes by the year 2000.  Potential revenue
is huge.  Other DSL agreements are being discussed with
other Baby-Bell regional carriers. Never failing to come up
with new marketing ideas to get subscribers, AOL is taking
its cue from Amway, Mary Kay and Tupperware, and will begin
marketing it's AOL Select service through a multi level
marketing organization called Monument Communications,
based in McLean, VA.

Still an Internet stock.

YHOO  Yahoo! Inc. $317.00 (-26.63)(+106.69)

Yahoo! Inc. is a global Internet media company that offers
a network of branded World Wide Web programming that serves
millions of users daily. As the first online navigational
guide to the Web, WWW.YAHOO.COM is the single largest guide
in terms of traffic, advertising, household and business user
reach, and is one of the most recognized brands associated
with the Internet. The company provides targeted Internet
resources and communications services for a broad range of
audiences, based on demographic, key-subject and geographic
interests.

We are adding YHOO back to the pick list with a precaution:
Wait for a positive confirmation!  YHOO is down over $125 from
its 52-week high.  Of all the Internet stocks, YHOO is the
closest thing to a blue-chip, except for AOL in this list also.
We like the chances that YHOO will turn strongly positive over
the next few weeks leading into it's split.  YHOO showed a classic
example of high expectations when it announced great earnings and
a stock split, yet has fallen drastically.  The internets have
played this game before.  They go in spurts, consolidate and then
take off again.  This is a risky play, but those that are willing
to take the risk, are often rewarded with extraordinary gains.

There are a lot of companies out there trying to duplicate the
success YHOO has had with it's web site.  Many on-line shopping
sites have used YHOO as a model.  Though this seems like it
might eat into YHOO's profits, the fact is that YHOO still leads
the pack.  The more awareness there is for online services, the
more hits YHOO will receive.  These added hits turn into added
advertising revenue which turns into more profits.  Ultimately,
more profits means higher stock prices.

*******************************************
WCOM - MCIWorldCom $75.06 (+0.06)(+3.25)(+1.62)(P4W +7.69)

Telecommunications behemoth, MCIWorldCom, is the recent
offspring between a marriage of formerly #2 long distance
provider MCI and #4 provider WorldCom.  Now the newly
formed giant of giants is duking it out with AT&T as they
stake their claim in the local phone service, international
service, cellular, paging, and Internet access arenas.
WorldCom's $37 billion purchase of MCI last September
qualifies it the 7th largest merger or acquisition in 1998.
WCOM is one of the largest Internet backbone providers in
the world.  If you're reading this letter, somewhere in the
transmission, WCOM fiber brought it to you.

Friday, WCOM gained over $4 from Friday's trading low on
heavy trading - nice comeback.  WCOM is showing a lot of
relative strength.  In last week's action, profits were
shaken out and buyers stepped in.  Though WCOM dipped below
support of $70, they didn't stay there long and finished
each day at no less than $72.  It appears to have
consolidated, and having bounced off its moving average,
should continue upward, market permitting.  Slight
resistance is $76 with harder resistance at $79.  Any
volume or overall market strength should push it right
through.  The markets were not disappointed when WCOM
backed away from bidding on Air Touch, which helped WCOM's
recovery.  We're still big believers in Bernie Ebbers,
WCOM's "awe shucks" chairman.

The big news last week, the U.S. General Services
Administration selected MCI WorldCom to provide long-
distance telephone, data and video telecommunications
services to Federal government agencies worldwide in the
second and final round of its multi(5)-billion dollar
FTS2001 competition.  WCOM is in high-bandwidth content
delivery tests with AOL, which should be successful and
more fully implemented through Bell Atlantic and SBC's DSL
services. With recent court rulings preventing the baby
bells from entering the long distance market in their home
areas, 20% growth in voice traffic and 100% growth in data
traffic every 4 months (!!! Gilder Technology Report) this
spells good news and continued earnings growth for the big
3 long distance providers.

T - AT&T $84.25 (-0.81)(+9.31)(+1.19)(+1.56)(P4W +12.06)

AT&T, the mother of all phone companies isn't just a long
distance company any more. Through growth and acquisition,
they now provide data transmission, video tele-
conferencing, PCS/wireless/cellular, Internet, paging and
local phone services via microwave, fiber and copper
infrastructure throughout the U.S. and international
markets.  Their annual revenues in excess of $55 billion
dwarf their nearest competitor, MCIWorldCom, by 5 times.
Their 1998 acquisition of TCG (formerly Teleport
Communications Group, the nations largest competitive local
exchange carrier) and IBM's data services division will add
substantially to their revenues.  Pending a merger with
cable giant, TCI, revenues could grow even more.  Michael
Armstrong, AT&T's CEO, has investors believing that AT&T is
no longer a copper wire dinosaur heading-up the telecom
extinction list.

Great defensive play in the face of market woes last week.
AT&T dipped just below $81 after the open Wednesday, it's
low trading point of the week, but finished up strongly at
$84.75.  Friday's recovery of $2.13 after Thursday's
nosedive to $82.12 came as investor's realized the sell-off
was overdone.  Merrill Lynch upgraded the week before last
to "Long Term Buy".  Technicals are a bit weak in light of
market conditions, but should recover with any market
strength.  Still, the big news:  3:2 stock split to occur
when the TCI deal closes around the end of March (no firm
date yet-we'll let you know the details when available), $4
billion stock repurchase (about 2.7% of shares in float at
current levels) and increased earnings estimates.  With
some of the profits shaken out, a better entry is possible,
but confirm direction before playing.

Not much price moving news this week (other than Brazil).
The week before last, AT&T got the green light to merge
with TCI thus creating a huge bandwidth pipe (lots of
transmission capacity) over "the last Mile" or that short
distance between the street and your phone jack.  It's
estimated that it costs $1200 per home for a typical
utility to trench and install any transmission equipment.
That's why even though the fiber optic cable runs down your
street, you can't yet access it.  It's too expensive to get
it to you.  Soon, you'll be able to bypass that fiber in
favor of AT&T/TCI cable.  It's already there.  Translation:
increased revenues.

ATI  AirTouch Communications $83.38 (+4.38)(+6.56)(+4.56)(+5.19)

AirTouch Communications provides wireless communications to nearly
14 million customers in the US and in 11 countries in Asia and
Europe. Its operations include cellular telephone service (#2 in
the US, after AT&T), paging, and personal communications service
through PrimeCo, its joint venture with Bell Atlantic. AirTouch has
joint ventures in Europe and Asia, including Portugal (Telecel)
and Sweden (Europolitan), where the cellular market is growing
rapidly. It holds a minority stake in the Globalstar satellite
network, which is scheduled to begin providing worldwide digital
phone communications in 1999.

Well, it is finally done. ATI is merging with Vodaphone. The
combined company, to be known as Vodafone AirTouch Plc, will
reach nearly one billion people in 23 countries on four
continents. Serving over 23 million proportionate cellular
and PCS customers, Vodafone AirTouch will be the largest
wireless company in the world by a substantial margin. The
merger is expected to benefit employees, customers and
stockholders. The deal puts ATI shares value at $97 based on
the January 15th close.

If you are not already in ATI, it's too late. ATI will gap open
on Monday.  We will wait and see how the reaction is after
Monday to decide if we should keep ATI long-term.  The only
reason we might keep it is because the deal involves 1 share
of ATI for .5 shares of VOD's ADR share price (plus $9 in cash
per share).  Thus if VOD continues to move up, ATI should
continue to move up too.  ATI is scheduled to announce earnings
on the 22nd of January.

Options will be out of date on the open Tuesday (that means
anything we quote today will probably be $10 too cheap by
Tuesday).  If we keep ATI on Tuesday, we will update the
current option prices.

LU  Lucent Technologies $110.25 (-5.06)(+5.31)(-2.12)

Lucent Technologies, Inc. is one of the world's leading
designers, developers and manufacturers of telecommunications
systems, software and products. The Company is a global market
leader in the sale of public telecommunications systems, and
is a supplier of systems or software to most of the worlds
largest network operators. They are also a global market
leader in the sale of business communications systems and
in the sale of microelectronic components for communications
applications to manufacturers of communications systems and
computers.

LU is back!!! After trading as low as $96.00 three days ago,
LU took back over $4 of those losses.  LU took a hit with the
news it was in talks with Ascend.  When the news became reality,
LU has firmed and is heading higher into earnings on the 21st.
LU says the merger will not affect earnings in 1999 and should
help earnings in 2000. It seems the merger is viewed as
positive by the public since LU has trended higher since the
news became official.  There is a possibility that LU could
announce a split with earnings, but the more likely time will
be after the shareholders meeting in February.

Lucent announced a new product for radio.  Lucent Digital
Radio's advancement, called Multi-Streaming, is based on
state-of-the-art capabilities in audio and wireless channel
coding technologies from Lucent's Bell Labs, and allows for
the best-quality FM audio to be delivered over a wide coverage
area, even under impaired channel conditions.

COMBINATION PLAYS - MARKET RECAP -Boom or Bust?
******************************************************************

U.S. stocks rallied on Friday, snapping back from the problem of
Brazilian currency devaluation as investors showed new confidence
in the market. The Dow closed up 220 points at 9340.55 and the
Nasdaq was up 71 points at 2348.21. Internet traders were focused
on Marketwatch.com as shares surged 473% and markets around the
world benefited from Brazil's move to let the inflation-busting
real float. The question is: Will the enthusiasm fade next week?

Our new spread plays were all available at favorable prices. The
first candidate was CIEN and a debit price of $3.50 (FEB12C/17C)
was easily attained in the morning trading. SDTI and SRCM went in
different directions but both were still playable. The credit for
the SDTI spread (FEB17P/20P) was slightly less than expected at
$0.50 and SRCM (FEB15P/17P) was right in line at $0.75. SRCM is
primarily a merger-speculation play and without news or continued
rumors, the stock price will drop. Watch it closely! AAPL was our
leg-in play and as recommended, we started with a long position
(FEB35P) at $1.12 and used the afternoon's downward momentum to
increase the price of the short option (FEB37P) to $2.00 for a
credit of $0.87. SUNW was up at the open but favorable positions
were still available at 10:00 AM as the stock price took a quick
breather. The (LJAN100C/FEB100C) calendar spread traded at $14.00.

Friday was expiration day for many of our plays and one of them
was a heart-stopper! Our credit spread on MCHP suffered cardiac
arrest after the company (on Thursday night) reported earnings
that were up from the previous year, but below Street estimates.
Shares fell over $5 in morning trading and although it eventually
went the distance (finishing at $35.12), the prudent exit was at
mid-day for a closing debit of $0.50, to break-even. The rest of
the credit spreads expired safely OTM. Even those that held AAPL
and BMCS to the close were successful.

We are starting to see more progress in the calendar spreads as
some of the positions are "paid for" and many have been moved to
the next higher strike. Our biggest dilemma is the ATI LEAP play
as the company said it agreed to merge with Britain's Vodafone
Group in a stock deal valued at about $56 billion. The merger is
considered valued at $97 per AirTouch common share and we are
curious to see the opening prices on our current positions next
week. Other short positions that were closed include CPQ, NOVL
and WCOM. New options need to be sold on OXHP and WCOM. BGP was
our only dismal failure and there may be some recovery next week.

The debit spreads did better this month, primarily because the
market was so bullish. Our main focus next week is the LU play.
We already have a profit and will plan to exit early on any bump
before the earnings. We are also watching FTL for any further
downward movement and hopefully some new take-over rumors will
surface. Good Luck!

The calendar (or time spread) is profitable if the value of the
position exceeds the initial debit (or cost-basis) at the end of
the expiration period for the long position. However, because we
track the plays based on the current closing cost/value, and some
of the plays have diagonal positions, the gains will rarely be
reflected until the play closes. Each month, as we sell a new call
against the long position, the net cost should decline or position
value should increase.

ABI - American Bankers Insurance  $48.87     Call Debit Spread

American Bankers Insurance Group (ABIG) sells wholesale, credit
related specialty insurance. Financial institutions, retailers,
automobile and manufactured-housing dealers, and representatives
then retail these policies to consumers. Products include property
insurance (on items ranging from mobile homes to appliances), as
well as life, unemployment, and disability insurance.

Trading in American Bankers Insurance Group options has been brisk
lately following weeks of inactivity as bid speculation reemerges.
Traders cited talk that American International Group, which had
attempted to buy American Bankers last year, (before Cendant Corp
outbid AIG and then pulled out of the deal because of accounting
problems) would return with another offer. Things are heating up
as ING Baring Furman Selz said it resumed coverage of ABI with a
"strong buy" rating. The report says American Bankers is one of
its favorite companies among specialty insurers and states the
company is likely to resume double digit revenue and earnings
growth in the second half of 1999 while earning 15% to 20% on its
equity. The 1999 share price target is $58 and the technical
outlook is favorable.

HUM - Humana Inc.  $19.50     (Neutral) Calendar Spread

One of the largest health care companies in the US, Humana offers
health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider
organizations (PPOs), and Medicare supplement insurance. They have
about 6 million members and Humana tries to cut costs by offering
physicians incentives and requiring pre-authorization for hospital
inpatient services and outpatient surgery. Medicare accounts for
almost one-third of sales, but Humana is cutting back its Medicare
HMO business. The company markets its products to employers and
other groups, as well as to certain Medicare-eligible individuals.
In the past year, Humana has been the sector's most active merger,
acquisition and divestiture participant as the company moved to
purchase health plans in its largest markets while divesting non-
strategic assets to focus on profitable core businesses.

A Florida appellate court recently ruled that a lawsuit against
Humana could not proceed as a class action and that it should be
dissolved. The opinion strongly supports HUM's contention that
the class action had no merit. This may help investors regain
favor with the company as its likely their business practices have
always been both ethical and legal. The chart reflects a new range
of trading developing near $20 and that makes it perfect for a
calendar spread.

PLAY (conservative):

BUY  CALL MAY-20 HUM-ED OI=3D567  A=3D$2.43
SELL CALL FEB-20 HUM-BD OI=3D1814 B=3D$1.12
NET DEBIT TARGET=3D$1.25 TARGET ROI=3D40%

Note: In the long-term calendar spread, we are reducing the net
cost of the long-term option by the credit from the sale of the
nearer-term call. If the near-term call expires worthless, we will
sell the MAR call to further reduce our debit. If your short-term
position is ITM on the last day of the strike, you need to buy it
back so that you DON'T have to exercise the long-term position. In
that case, your long option is going up in value also and on the
last day of the strike period, the short call will shrink down to
intrinsic value so you will be ahead in the play even after you
buy it back.

GMSTF - Gemstar Intl.  $59.87     Put Credit Spread

GMSTF develops, markets and licenses proprietary technologies and
systems that simplify and enhance consumers' interaction with
electronics products and other platforms that deliver video,
programming information and other data. A recent report rated the
stock "neutral" for conservative investors and "accumulate" for
more aggressive investors based on the company's huge potential
and superior management. A 14 month conservative target price was
set at $57.00. GMSTF also recently filed patent infringement suits
against Scientific Atlanta, Pioneer and General Instrument Corp,
claiming that these companies willfully infringed two (Levine)
patents, by virtue of deployment, marketing, offers to sell and
sale of cable set top boxes containing an interactive program
guide not licensed under these patents. The Levine patents broadly
cover, among others, an interactive program guide using locally
stored or cached data. Gemstar is seeking injunctions and monetary
damages from these companies. Other news includes acquisitions of
VideoGuide and Starsight.

Basically, we favor the technical trading range tops near $45 as
current support for this position but use the downward momentum
by opening the long position first. Then sell the short position
when the stock price firms, to create the credit spread.

Capital One Financial Corporation is a holding company, whose
subsidiaries provide a variety of products and services including
credit card products, certain consumer lending, deposit services,
and various operating, administrative and other services. COF is
one of the largest issuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards in
the United States. Quarterly earnings are due soon and they expect
to exceed analysts' current expectations. The reported earnings
should be approximately 30% higher than 1998 and that is above the

Pharmaceutical Technologies, which designs oral, microparticulate,
and transdermal (patch) delivery systems; Athena Neurosciences,
which develops drugs for such disorders as Alzheimer's disease;
and Axogen, a research and development (R&D) spinoff. The company
is also bulking up with acquisitions, including Sano Corporation,
Neurex, and Kodak's drug-delivery system maker NanoSystems. Elan
makes some 20 products (including Cardizem CD, marketed by Hoechst
Marion Roussel) sold in more than 45 countries. Based on the news,
lots of drugs and new products in the pipeline. The recent merger
frenzy may have hurt the current bottom-line and investor support
is fading. Just another technical play as this stock has failed

INDEX OPTION SPREADS...
******************************************************************
As a trader, you may be familiar with options on individual stocks
where you have the right to buy (call option) or the right to sell
(put option) a particular stock at some predetermined price within
some predetermined time. The buyer has the rights and the seller
the obligations. With index options the basic ideas are the same.
Index options allow you to make investment decisions on a specific
market industry or on the market as a whole. Spread strategies can
be made with index options similar to those made with individual
stock options. Many professional traders employ index spreads as a
hedge strategy. We favor debit positions on the SPX for momentum
and longer-term plays and OTM credit spreads on the OEX when the
risk/reward is favorable. Low ROI disparity spreads will be listed
(when available) for the conservative index trader.
*******************************************************************
OEX - S&P 100 Index  $616.46     OTM Credit-Spreads

The Standard & Poor's 100 Index is a capitalization-weighted index
of 100 stocks from a broad range of industries. The component
stocks are weighted according to the total market value of their
outstanding shares. The impact of a component's price change is
proportional to the issue's total market value, which is the share
price times the number of shares outstanding.

OBSERVATIONS:

For OTM credit spread trades, we like to use the actively-traded
S&P 100 Index options because they contain much more premium than
options on individual stocks and provide an underlying instrument
less prone to huge, gapping moves. Remember however, that you can
always be exercised early so monitor your positions daily.

TECHNICALS:

The overall market seems likely to remain in a wide trading range
over the next few weeks and the long-term outlook is for a two-way
market with somewhat neutral bias. Secondary issues are performing
well but big-caps continue to suffer. The DOW and the S&P 500 both
remain above their 30 wma's and over 50% of all stocks are now in
stage II. The call/put ratio is slightly pessimistic so there may
be some upside testing before any further correction. Review the
OEX trading pit for more specific technical information on the S&P
100 Index.

**********************************************??Never, ever trust a central=
 bank in a foreign country with it's?currency under attack.??Remember the v=
ow from the central bank in Brazil on Thursday??"We will utilize every rese=
rve at our disposal to prevent the?disastrous floating of the Real". I gues=
s their reserves were?as limited as my wife's checking account since less t=
welve hours?later they announced they would float the Real on a temporary?b=
asis in order to protect their reserves. Sounds like a?contradiction to me.=
 So why did the markets rebound instead of?crash as analysts had predicted?=
??Ask ten analysts and you will get ten different answers but the?two most =
common are "it took a level of uncertainty out of the?market" and "relief t=
hat the free market forces would now determine?the level of the Real and no=
t artificial stability enforced by the?government". The first one makes no =
sense at all. On Thursday the?Dow crashed -228 points on worries that Brazi=
l MIGHT float. So?on Friday they floated and because there was no uncertain=
ty left?the market exploded? Lost me there. The second reason make much?mor=
e sense. Brazil has been fighting the flight of funds from the?country by r=
aising interest rates to a crushing 40% or more. How?would you like to have=
 that kind of credit card interest? How?can a country survive paying 40% on=
 it's debt? It can't, not for?long. The relief shown in Brazil markets was =
immediate and huge.?The Bovespa surged +1,690 points or +33.41%. That would=
 be the?equivalent of +3,123 point Dow day. (please, please, just let?me be=
 fully invested the night before!!) I bet they are still?celebrating in Bra=
zil today. Yes their money is worth less but?now they can at least kep more=
 of it. The remaining problem is?with Chile, Argentina, and the other close=
ly linked South American?countries. They will be watching the Real and if i=
t sinks fast?then they will be forced to devalue as well. The dominos are?a=
lready lining up. All eyes will be on the support given to?Brazil by the U.=
S. and the IMF in the coming weeks to see if?the Real can stand on it's own=
 or become a blackhole, sucking?everyone in South America down with it.??No=
w back to our reality. The market, for whatever reason,?exploded Friday, th=
e day before a long weekend, when it should?have been cautious. Remember th=
e oversold conditions we talked?about on Thursday. The rubber band analogy =
I used last week on?the +500 point gain also works on a -500 point loss. Wh=
en?markets get stretched so tight either way there has to be a?relief day w=
here things snap back to normal. We experienced?that Friday. I have been pr=
eaching the return of the January?bull market rally after the profit taking=
 for over a week.?Surprise, it is back! Those of you who bought the dip on?=
Thursday are looking pretty smart today.??The Nasdaq actually finished up f=
or the week! Tech stocks?rebounded strong and were really not supported by =
the Internet?stocks. Some Internets were up Friday but the majors were?stil=
l taking profits. Speaking of major Internet stocks, we?are starting YHOO a=
gain today for the split run. Yahoo dropped?-98 points in the last four day=
s but closed +$13 off it's?Friday lows. The 2:1 split is Friday Feb 5th, on=
ly three?weeks away. We know the Internets have had several downgrades?in t=
he last week but they were only downgraded on price, not?performance. Those=
 of you who have the ability to trade YHOO?should look for an entry point t=
his week. Don't blindly jump?in on Tuesday. Confirm lack of downward moveme=
nt first.??We had a conference at the office here last week with many?of th=
e newsletter contributors coming in from all over the U.S.?We were planning=
 the first Option Investor Seminar in February.?(details below) What really=
 came out of the planning process?was the need to educate traders on "trend=
 trading" (not trend?holding) and setting profit goals. While all this will=
 be?discussed in detail at the seminar there is a real need based?on the em=
ail we get to touch on some of the concepts here.??Let me try an analogy fo=
r trend trading. The market is like?the waves on the ocean. If you are stan=
ding on one of the?major surfing beaches you will see wave after wave come?=
crashing through. Between each major wave is a period of?calm which may hav=
e several smaller waves. If you have ever?stood in the surf you are familia=
r with the sensation called?undertow. This is when the water rushes back ou=
t to sea in?preparation for the next wave. Now picture yourself with a?desi=
re to surf. You have seen people do it. You go to a?surfboard shop and buy =
a board. You ask the salesman if?surfing is hard. No problem, he says. Lay =
on the board,?swim out in the surf, catch a wave, stand up on the board?and=
 surf back in. Easy! Now I ask you, can you surf? If you?are like most begi=
nner surfers you get out to the waves but?now you feel more like a piece of=
 driftwood bobbing in an?endless sea than a human mastering the art of surf=
ing. You?are battered, soaked, tired and more likely then not pretty?frustr=
ated with being abused by every wave you tried to?catch. Options trading is=
 like surfing. Trading, the salesman?says, is easy. You just open an accoun=
t, (board), jump in?the market (ocean), catch a wave (stock), buy some call=
s?(surf), and end up safely on the beach (profit). NOT!?Most beginning trad=
ers think it is this easy. Most end up?on the rocks (broke).??What we want =
to teach you is to be a successful trader, not?a buy and holder. When you a=
re learning to surf you probably?practice on hundreds of smaller waves. Eac=
h one moving you?only a few yards before you fall and have to start over.?L=
earning how to trade is the same way. You should try to?catch many small mo=
ves and practice improving your skills?before attempting the long run to th=
e beach. I am constantly?besieged by email on new people expecting to buy a=
 $3 option?and sell it for $15. That would be the equivalent of swimming?ha=
lf a mile off shore, catching a fifty foot wave and surfing?all the way to =
the beach on your first try. It just does not?happen. What we have tried to=
 teach people in the past it to?take a small profit many times instead of a=
 large profit once.??For those that are mathematically challenged let me il=
lustrate.?If you start with a $10,000 account and generate a 10% profit?eve=
ry week for a year, WITHOUT COMPOUNDING, after twelve months?you would have=
 over $60,000. If you COMPOUND the 10% then you?would have over $1,000,000.=
 At just 10% a week! Now before you?start firing off those emails I know yo=
u can't compound 10%?every week. First you may hit some losers now and then=
 but?you are also going to hit some bigger winners more often. Just?to illu=
strate. If you bought an option for $5.00 and sold it?for $5.50 that is a 1=
0% profit. Now how many times have you?bought an option and watched it go u=
p $1-$2 and then slip?back down again the next day? More often than not! No=
w, if?you had put in a sell for $6.00 that is a 20% profit and?probably wou=
ld fill the same day. If you did that twice a?week, how much would that be =
a week. CLUE 40% Now if you?could get only 10% or $.50 per week compounded =
over a year?it would be over $1,000,000. Is $.50 hard to do over and?over a=
nd over? Of course not. Is 40% possible? absolutely.?The real number is som=
ewhere in between.??It is only hard to do if you HOLD and not TRADE. How fa=
r are?you going to get if you just hold on to your surf board with?both han=
ds for dear life? You will be pushed to and fro?wherever the ocean (market)=
 takes you. Sometimes you will?be pushed to the beach (profit) or onto the =
rocks (broke)?or drift out to sea never to be seen again. (clueless)??Now t=
hat I have completely lost my train of thought let's?get to the point. Ever=
y stock ebbs and flows. Remember the?3-5-7 trend cycle from last week? Up t=
hree days, down one,?up five days, down three, up seven days, down five. Ev=
ery?stock will normally trade in one of these cycles. The trick?is to buy t=
he stock on the down side and sell it on the up?side. Again, you do not hav=
e to be in the market every day.?It is better to only be in the market WHEN=
 THERE IS PROFIT?TO BE MADE. Everything else is noise. Sometimes expensive?=
noise. Learn to play the trends. Watch a stock for several?days. Study the =
charts. Watch the intraday charts. Learn?how it moves. I traded TXN early l=
ast year for a month.?It would always jump up at the open, wander during th=
e day?and drop at the close. For weeks I would sell at the open?for a $.50 =
to $1.00 profit and then buy the same option?back at the close for almost w=
hat I had paid for it the?day before. Day in and day out. Cash flow. 10% a =
day.?(don't even bother to compound that) In this current bull?market there=
 are many, many stocks that you can make 10%?or more a day just trading the=
 trends. The larger your?account becomes the easier it gets. You can start =
taking?5% a day. For instance, look at a CSCO chart or an ASND.?Can you see=
 any way possible to not have made a $1.00 a?day, two or three days a week,=
 just trading those stocks???The positive trend is the key. Find a stock wi=
th a trend,?pick and option, WAIT for an entry point, set a limit sell.?Rep=
eat, repeat, repeat, repeat......??I want 10 volunteers. Pick a stock or tw=
o, practice the?above plan and send me your results. I will publish the?res=
ults and give each of you a years free subscription.?Obviously I will have =
15,000 emails tomorrow volunteering?and I can't take you all. The first 10 =
with verifiable?results will qualify. It does not matter whether you trade?=
one contract or one hundred. The key is the pattern. No?fair using past res=
ults. All trades must be after today.?Trade confirmations must be available=
.??When I publish these results you will never look at a?mutual fund claimi=
ng a 25% annual return again. How can?they brag about beating the S&P!! I w=
ould be embarrassed.??I have not seen any earth shaking economic news so fa=
r?this weekend and the Fed does not meet again till February?so I would exp=
ect the rally we had Friday to continue next?week. I am excited and you sho=
uld be also. Earnings are?starting to flow and we have many split candidate=
s in the?next 2-3 weeks. This is the perfect time to be in the?market. If y=
ou don't profit from it you should be in?mutual funds.??Good Luck???Jim Bro=
wn?Editor???************?JIM'S PLAYS?************?What a nightmare week! Ju=
st goes to show that the best laid?plans of mice and men sometimes go astra=
y. Everything was?looking so good moving into last week. We expected a litt=
le?profit taking and then off to the races again. Little did we?expect a mo=
nster dip caused by Brazil at the end of the profit?taking. The put-credit-=
spreads that were well on their way?to expiring worthless for a full profit=
, suddenly were in?jeporday of being a serious liability. My INKT 150 puts =
were?$30 out of the money on Monday and $10 in the money on?Wednesday! Ouch=
. Short cover madness. The 130-puts still?expired worthless but I bit the b=
ullet on the $150. Then?on Thursday the 50-contract MCHP $35 put credit spr=
ead was?safely out of the money with MCHP at $41.50. The bid was?$.06 x.19.=
 Thursday night MCHP announced earnings and missed?their estimates by $.01.=
 BOOM! Down $8.00 Friday morning!?The bid is now $3.50 for an option I wrot=
e for $.56.?Fortunately MCHP came back to close at $35.13. I covered the?50=
 contracts at $.38 30 min before the close and was happy?to get it. People =
emailed me last month and asked why I?had closed several put spreads severa=
l days early for .25?or less when I could have let them expire worthless. T=
his?was why. Always take a profit when one is available and you?will never =
lose money. Holding an option long term is like?suicide. The trade will blo=
w up on you when you least expect?it.??The $45 NEON put credit spread was c=
losed at .25 for almost?a maximum profit.??I closed the ATI calls for a sub=
stantial loss after the bidders?started dropping out. Had I held until Frid=
ay I could have?broken even.??I will probably get criticized for the follow=
ing but I have?suffered in the past from not selling in the face of seeming=
ly?very bad news and did not want to have history repeat itself.?When the f=
irst Asian problem occurred in Oct 1997 I was heavily?invested and did not =
sell. I thought it was no big deal and?would bounce back in a day or two. I=
 woke up at the open on?the biggest drop day to see the futures lock limit =
down at?-27 and Dow futures out of sight. It was a disaster and by?not sell=
ing at the open I lost almost three times as much.?So the point of the stor=
y was I did not want to be holding?if Brazil was going to explode the world=
 economy again.??I took a bloodbath Wednesday morning and sold at the low f=
or?the day. The good news was that I was in cash for the rebound.?Once I re=
alized that the bull market was viewing this as a?buying opportunity I jump=

As you work through these issues, please remember that even though the Mexico 
commercial group may not plan to offer many of their own products and may not 
expect many other products to appeal to their customers, the EnronOnline 
people will expect all products listed online to be available unless we can 
articulate a compelling reason to restrict them.

Carol,

I've been working with Jaime Williams and our outside tax advisors to 
determine the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products that 
Jaime has informed me will be offered to Mexican counterparties through 
EnronOnLine and, potentially, a separate ENA Mexican entity.  I should be 
able to provide the results by Friday or Monday.  Please contact me at ext.

Subject: Online Issues - Mexico

Jeff:
As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement 
online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we 
should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone 
trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights 
create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will 
be ENA.

I think this attachment is probably the treaty you want.  I'm sorry it didn't

Mark, congratulations on your promotion to Vice President.

On a more mundane matter could you have a clerk or legal assistant get me a 
copy of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the US and Argentina.  Our 
regulatory and commercial group wants to leave no stone unturned in their 
search for how to deal with the ENARGAS.


Dave:

Here is the agreement I received from London which I have revised to apply to 
the Chicago situation.  Let's consider this a rough draft at present.  It 
does identify some interesting issues regarding how this will work.  let's 
get together and go through it and see what we need and what we don't.  Let 
me know what time works for you.

Mark, I am forwarding a copy of OUC's ISDA along with a copy of their charter 
and their outside legal opinion on their ability to enter into financial 
hedges.  Could you please assign to the appropriate attorney to work on this 
ISDA.

John, I'm not sure if you are the approprite credit person or not to work on 
this. They mentioned that they have already exchanged credit information 
between OUC and Enron.  If you're not the right person, could you please pass 
it on.

I would like to push this process along to get an executed ISDA between OUC 
and Enron.  I believe that they could be a good counterparty for us.

Thanks for your help.

I would follow the Canadian model for the UK and would endorse Scott's views 
about the sophistication of the UK courts. Deals done on the ISDA form, where 
Engish law is agreed, will automatically bring the parties to the English 
courts. I think we should also consider the position under our continental 
power documents and perhaps think about crystallising in writing a policy on 
this area which is more trading oriented than the existing policy.

The response from Richard is that we are happy with UK courts so long as our 
counterparty is in the UK, but if we have a counterparty on the continent and 
there is any chance that submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of UK 
courts might not be fully enforced in the counterparty's country, we should 
go to arbitration.  In other words, we would prefer arbitration to ending up 
in court in a jurisdiction in Europe.

Let's add this to the list of topics to discuss when I'm in London.

My sense is that the market custom here is to use the English courts, not 
arbitration. I think the English commercial court judges are pretty 
sophisticated and would be able to work through the issues.

Since Paul is out this week, I haven't had a chance to speak to him about 
this. Let's wait to hear his views when he returns to the office. Thanks!

Subject: UK Courts vs. Arbitration for UK Swap Agreements

Richard:

In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration 
in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to 
judges or, God forbid, juries.  In Canada we are continuing to submit to the 
jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in 
civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts 
generally).  As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap 
agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK 
agreements.  Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts 
(where there are no juries in civil actions).  Should this continue to be our 
policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?  I 
would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely 
enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it.

Thanks,

Mark

Dear Mark

Do you know of any legal issue that there could be about adding our own time 
stamp to a stock quote from Reuters (so that people viewing the site would 
know when the stock quotes were last updated by us)?

Let me know if I should direct this question to someone else.

Thanks Mark

Jay
We may have a problem with adding our own time stamp.  First, I believe our 
agreement with Reuters limits our ability to modify their content and 
restricts what we can say about the current nature of the quotes (they are 
time delayed) and second, we don't want our time stamp to make people believe 
that the quote was even current as of that time - since it won't be.  It 
might be ok to have the entire quotes section headed by a line indicating 
when it was last refreshed.  Many sites providing quotes like this have a 
line (usually towards the bottom) indicating the delay period and most people 
using those sites know they have to refresh their screen to update them.  
Jason Peters is the expert on the terms of that agreement, so if you still 
feel like you need to add something you might check with him.

As I understand it, the answer is 'no'--we get a quote from Reuters but not 
the time stamp.  The time stamp that would appear is the one that we place 
next to it, telling the user when the quote was placed on the site.  So if 
you happen along at noon and you see 'ENE 70 9am', you know that you're most 
certainly not getting a recent price.

I think we handled this in Phase I through the Legal and Privacy Statement 
which is available through a link from each EnronOnline page, including the 
home page.  If memory serves, the advice (including the language for the 
Legal and Privacy Statement) came from Clifford Chance.  Justin will probably 
be able to fill you in on our thinking at the time.  Will that be sufficient 
for Phase II?  We can revise the Legal and Privacy Statement if that is 
necessary.

They were a company that was subcontracted out to do a promotional video for

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence

Here's a break down of the Wooden Private Office "E" station (Cherry Wood) 
vs. the Laminate Private Office "E" station (Off white laminate). All quotes 
are approximate and based on reusing our existing inventory, if available. 
Lead-time for both is approximately 3-5 weeks based on quantities.

Wooden Private Office "E" Station = $2100. each

Laminate Private Office "E" Station = $750. each

Feel free to call me if there are questions.

Thanks,

Attached is the story with my comments.

1.  I changed 'standard" to 'familiar' and deleted the reference to price 
discovery since these are elements of futures contracts, comparison to which 
we would like to avoid.  If the price reference is important, 'transparency' 
would work as a replacement for 'discovery.'

2.  The changes to the last paragraph are to avoid the suggestion that the PA 
and Reg. forms can be filled out online (they are available to be downloaded 
but must be signed and sent to us offline).

What do you know about the issue of electronic signatures?  Is this service 
or a similar service something we should further explore?

Dave,
Thank you for the prompt reply.
There are many areas where electronic signatures can reduce business costs
and enable new applications.  But, most importantly Enron and Enron Online
needs to know they can trust an electronic signature.  AlphaTrust can
serve as the 3rd party managing your electronic signatures including risk
management.  There are many costs associated with implementing an
electronic signature service with the polices and legal requirements.  And
typically there can be a 12-18 month time frame to implement.

AlphaTrust provides the infrastructure,
AlphaTrust provides the legal framework and fraud protection across all
jurisdictions including internationally,
AlphaTrust can enable your business to get started quickly.





I will call you next week to follow-up.  If you like we can coordinate a
call with your legal counsel and my CEO who understands the laws to a
great extent.

Thank you,
Randall Whitfield

Tana and I were unable to find anything useful here.  David Mitchell thought 
he might find something for us in his files and will send it to us but as he 
remembers it, we never got very far with the details.  He probably just 
advised that if we ever did set up a CTA that it should be completely 
separate - both in legal entity and staff - from our trading activities and 
should be Chinese Wall fenced  as well.  I'll send over whatever we receive 
from him and warned him that you might be calling.My comments:

It's not clear to me what it means to say that Joe Hockey "joined" in the 
launch (end of first paragraph).
They may be planning to update this just before release but the numbers in 
the fourth paragraph have increased (I think it's up to $90 bil.) .
The word "values" should probably be "value" in the last line of the fourth 
paragraph.

Attached is a first draft of a press release announcing the availability of 
Australian and Japan weather derivatives through EnronOnline.  We currently 
plan to issue this press release on May 26, in conjunction with a briefing 
event in Sydney.  However, there is a slight possibility that the 
announcement will be moved up to July 19.  Since there are a number of 
subsequent approval steps, your early review and comments would be 
appreciated.

Dave, please let me know whether you would like to run this by Louise now or 
have me make any recommended changes and send it to her directly, later.

Thank you for your attention to this request.  I will be in the office 
(1-713-646-6423) for the remainder of the week if you want to discuss this.

This request was previously made to Susan Flynn.  Confirm has had no response

Since you are the most Veteran member of the team would you mind advising as

This deal with Anadarko is a little tricky.  It is a Gas Daily Call Option

AtHome dialed Excite's number and Compaq is on hold....


AtHome agreed to purchase XCIT today for $7 billion. This was
a significant premium over the current stock price but when
you are an Internet stock this could be a one day move.

Rumors are flying that Compaq is preparing to make a major
Internet purchase maybe as early as tomorrow. Lycos is the
most mentioned possible target.

This Internet mania helped power the Nasdaq to another record
close and is credited with pulling the Dow out of another
valuation worry induced profit taking session. How can you
be bearish about the market in general when the tech stocks
are continuing to beat earnings estimates and blow away whisper
numbers.

Microsoft announced after the close and showed just how big
the $5 bln gorilla really is. The $5 bln was sales for last
quarter. MSFT announced $.73 vs estimates of $.59 and blew
away the whisper number of $.62. Microsoft was trading up +5.00
after the close. There was no split announcement and this could
be attributed to the trial publicity. They don't want to appear
too prosperous for the penalty phase. The conference call was
typically pessimistic as they tried to keep a lid on analyst's
estimates for the future. I would expect MSFT to gap open on
Wednesday.

The futures are up +6.50 at 7:10 ET and we give the credit to
MSFT and several other announcements after the bell. The fly
in the ointment could be the Alan Greenspan testimony tomorrow
in Washington. He is sure to be asked some "irrational exuberance"
type questions and the answers could be earth shaking. Some
analysts say Mr. G. has been criticized so severely by congress
for his previous market moving performances that future comments
will likely be constrained. Don't bet the farm on this. Alan
is tasked with many insurmountable projects one of which is
keeping the U.S. markets under control. The recent Internet
"froth" is something that other Fed governors have pointed at
in the past as a sign of a speculative bubble. So even though
the futures are up now, we may see some weakness before the
testimony. If we get by without any earthquake comments then
the week could continue up strongly. The Brazil problem could
even be a muzzle for Mr. G. Better to be quiet than roil the
markets and have to lower rates again next month to rescue them
again.

Clinton gets a major play tonight with the televised State of
the Union speech. He is under a strong spotlight as people look
for signs of cracks in the presidential armor. What should he do?
Pull out some heavy firepower! He is planning just that. Clinton
will unveil his support for a plan to take some Social Security
funds and put them into the market in a retirement savings account
program. Estimates in the $500-700 bln range are being tossed
about. This is not a new concept but his support for this popular
plan is new and timely given the other problems he is facing.
Maybe we should keep his feet to the fire longer if he is going
to do us favors like this. Not only would I rather my Social
Security was gaining ground in an account of this style but can
you imagine the market impact of a $700 bln inflow of cash?
Don't count your chickens yet but stay tuned for plan details
if it is ever approved. Opponents claim losses could occur if
a long term bear market were to appear.

I got considerable email about the 10% plan in Sunday's commentary.
Some good and some bad. Most of the good came from traders that
started putting this type of plan into action several months ago
when I wrote about it last. Most of them have multiplied their
accounts by several hundred percent. The negative mail seemed to
come from readers that were new to the newsletter and had small
accounts and were adamant that you should only settle for 200-300%
returns on every trade. We will see what kind of mail I get several
weeks from now when we start publishing the results from the readers
who are going to implement the plan. I had many readers email that
they were going to faithfully try it and report back. Good Luck!
The first ten who can show ten trades will win a years subscription.
Anybody can still play. Just send a recap of your completed plays
after 1/17/99 using the 10-20% plan from Sundays newsletter.

This is going to be an interesting week. Keep your options open
and make those trades. With the put/call ratio at .42 and the
advances only barely beating the declines 1506/1492, we are not
out of the woods yet. Tommorrow could be another record breaker
for the Nasdaq but the broader market internals are still weak.
Just three stocks in the Dow accounted for over +60 points today.
T +7.75, IBM +7.06, GM +4.69. The odds are real good that these
stocks will not be the leaders tomorrow and new leaders are hard
to find. Without these huge gains today we would have been very
negative. -46 without accounting for the positive impact they
had on other Dow components. Keep your fingers crossed.


Good Luck

Jim Brown

Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
************************************************************

Option Speculators Quiet ahead of State of the Union Address

With the State of the Union Address and Greenspan scheduled to
speak tomorrow, not much was revealed in the market today with
respect to market sentiment.  Pinnacle is still tracking what
option speculators do over the next couple of days for clues as
to where the broader market is likely to go.

We are entering a new expiration period and therefore some of the
indexes and put/call ratios will become volatile over the next
couple of days as options traders establish new positions.

Pinnacle is still concerned by the excessive Bullish sentiment as
tracked by Investors Intelligence latest poll - 60% Bullish, %30
Bearish.  This is the highest level for bullish sentiment that
we have seen for a while.

Pinnacle's short-term indicators are still flashing bearish
overtones over the near-term so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.  Any questions regarding
market sentiment can be directed at:

The Power of Expectation Analysis

It has often been said that the crowd is right during the
market trends but wrong at both ends.  Measuring and
evaluating the sentiment of the crowd, therefore, can give
savvy option traders a decided edge.

PICKS WE DROPPED
****************
When we drop a pick it doesn't mean we are recommending a sell
on that play. Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.
We drop a pick because something happened to change its
profile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we
don't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.
We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are
unfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we
want them to look at any current pick as a valid play.


CALLS:
******

None.


PUTS:
******

XCIT $110.00 +42.50 (+42.50) Gapped up on buy out news from
At Home (ATHN). Represents one of the biggest Internet deals
to date. Pinnacle, therefore, dropping XCIT. It does
underscore one of the benefits of buying a put instead of
shorting the stock. Only the premium is lost on the $42 gap.

BMCS $41.50 +1.44 (+1.44) Pinnacle dropping software firm
after BMCS closed above key $41 benchmark and the Software
Index (CWX) closed in record territory.



PICK NEWS - CALLS
*******************************************************
SUNW $105.31 +4.88 (+4.88)  This could be a huge week for
Sun Microsystems.  Already, the horses are off and running.
On Tuesday, Sun added +$4.88 to set another all time high in
intraday trading at $105.44.  In an awesome display of
strength, it broke and held above its former resistance level
of $104.50.  Maybe the move was propelled by some formidable
press releases.  Royal Philips Electronics NV and the Sony
Corp. will announce an alliance with SUNW.  The plan is to use
Sun's Jini, a form of the Java programming language, to develop
software that can network entertainment devices and appliances
by using the Internet.  The Sharper Image, Digital Video
Express, 1-800-FLOWERS, Egghead.com, Inc., and Brite Voice
Systems have all turned to Sun's highly reliable servers,
storage, and software products to handle their growing needs.
More than likely the stock is taking off because of Sun's
earnings announcements which are due out after the market
closes on Thursday Jan. 21st.  Earnings estimates for SUNW
are $0.66.  Along with a solid earnings report, we are
predicting a 2:1 stock split announcement.  SUNW last split
in November of 1996 when the stock was trading near $60.
With 950 mln shares authorized and only 380 mln outstanding
they have plenty of room for a split.  After MSFT's huge
earnings explosion, the techs should take off tomorrow,
but then again investor enthusiasm will be fighting
investor fear with Greenspan speaking on Wednesday.

MYG $64.69 +0.44 (+0.44)  Maytag is looking good so far this
week.  The turn around in the market on Tuesday seemed to
help Maytag add +$0.44 on the day.  Hopefully the market will
continue to stabilize and help MYG challenge its latest
resistance level of $66.00 which isn't too far away
considering Maytag inched up to $65.25 in intraday trading.
Maytag announces its earnings on Feb. 4th and remains one of
our split candidates.

FTL $18.00 +$1.31 (+1.31) Even though we are playing FTL as a
take over play, (on rumors), with this weeks news that the
clothing maker is now the exclusive apparel supplier for
all 56 Planet Hollywood Cafes, FTL still opened on a down
note.  But picked up the pace and shot up to $18.75 for
the daily high, then settling down to close at $18.00.
Rumors had a $23.00 buy out announcement coming on last
Tuesday but as we all know, it didn't show. FTL is still
showing volatility, so be careful with this one.

CCU $63.13  +$2.69 (+2.69)  CCU was added as a play this
weekend and did not disappoint us on the first day of trading
News about this new concept in Internet communications
(digital radio) is all around the street.  By investing
in the research that will carry Net surfing to new levels,
CCU might just catch that big wave.  CCU opened and tested
it's support of $60.00 by dipping its toes below the water
line at $59.62.  Then came up for a big gulp of air to
$64.00, and caught a good wave to finish at $63.12 on
the day. Protect your profits, while watching for tomorrow's
next call of "surfs up"!

EMC $102.13 +2.06 (+2.06) EMC just keeps going up.  It set a
new 52 week high today, and closed at the high.  There was an
interesting article at MSN MoneyCentral comparing EMC and its
rival NTAP.  An observation by the article was that every bit
of new e-mail, every sale over the Internet, and every extra
page view increases the need to build more storage into the
Internet.  It also pointed out that EMC has just begun selling
software to its customer base.  Software sales are expected to
grow from $400 million in 1998 to $1 billion by 2001.  EMC
reports earnings before the open on 1/26 (next Tuesday).

JBL $73.75 -.13 (-.13) JBL keeps bouncing around and off its 21
day moving average which is currently at $72.82.  We really
need something to get this stock going again.  We have not had
any news, and JBL doesn't release earnings until March.  JBL's
two main competitors, SLR and SCI, both went up today.  JBL has
been following these two, so maybe JBL will start moving up.
Otherwise, its chart is starting to flatten out and it looks
like its momentum is slowing.  Wait for confirmation of upward
movement before initiating any new trades.

UTX $109.00 .69 (-.69) UTX gapped open this morning and then
traded down the rest of the day.  There was an article today
about the run that UTX has been on since October in seeming
defiance of a slowing global economy.  UTX does about 55% of
its business overseas.  Analysts pointed out that the company's
forecast of 15% growth in 1999 has been one of the keys to its
recent run.  UTX releases earnings this Thursday.  Only play
UTX if the Dow is moving up, otherwise wait for the earnings
release on Thursday to see which direction UTX is headed.
There is the possibility of a split announcement with their
earnings but we don't feel that strongly about it.

QCOM $66.50 +2.63 (+2.63) QCOM announced earnings today of 65
cents per share and blew away the estimate of 59 cents per
share.  QCOM also reported the highest quarterly revenues in
its 13-year history.  Revenues were $941 million for the first
quarter of fiscal 1999, an increase of 20 percent over the
first quarter of fiscal 1998.  Net income for the first quarter
was $49 million compared to $37 million for the first quarter
of fiscal 1998, a 32 percent increase.  In other news, QCOM's
joint venture with Microsoft announced their first service
offering, named Revolv.  Revolv is a service that will provide
mobile professionals with secure access to information using a
variety of wireless or mobile devices form anywhere they
travel.  QCOM should have no trouble with its old 52 week high
of $67.38 tomorrow.

DELL $82.13 +3.13 (+3.13)  More un-noticed, great
news.  "Dell has become a force to be reckoned with in the
personal workstation market," said Tom Copeland,
workstation analyst at IDC.  "Dell's workstation market
share grew at 186 percent, substantially more than the
industry average of 36 percent, and far more than any other
vendor"(Business Wire). Dell is now tied with Hewlett
Packard as the number 1 producer of personal work stations.
They announce new products weekly without fanfare.  Dell
closed at a new all-time high today on average volume in
the wake of stellar NASDAQ gains.  Volume was 14 million
shares, a little light for our taste.  But we'll take a $3
gain any way we can get it.  Look for Dell to move up more,
market permitting.  Wait for small pullbacks to scale into
a position.  Earnings to be announced February 16.

CSCO $106.38 +4.69 (+4.69)  Cisco closed $0.12 off its
high of the day.  Nice show of strength on 21% higher
than average volume.  No earth shaking news, but
Cisco has announced 3 new programs to not just sell
equipment to service providers, but design, manage and
implement its installation for maximum efficiency and least
cost to the client.  More important to the bigger picture,
CSCO is the big beneficiary in developing the Internet,
including providing equipment for the AT&T/TCI deal.
Looking strong, but after 3 days of higher closings, keep
an eye out for the dip, and then make your move.
Resistance is $108.  Still a split candidate.  Look for
earnings February 2.

AOL $150.50 +4.00 (+4.00)  Not much AOL news since last
week.  Today's Internet spotlight held all eyes on @Home's
proposed purchase of Excite, which should have thrown some
competitive cold water on AOL, but it didn't.  Even on 60%
of average volume, AOL added $4.00.  We'll feel a lot
better when AOL adds volume to confirm the upward price
movement.  In the meantime, AOL adds more tension to the
rubber band as it consolidates toward a "snap" date between
now and earnings scheduled to be announced on January 27th
after 5:00pm ET.  AOL is also a split candidate at these
price levels (over $120).  We anticipate a split along with
earnings.  For the next couple of days, target shooting
your entry to coincide with the dip after opening should
get a better entry.  As always, confirm market direction
first.

WCOM $77.25 +2.19 (+2.19) Baby Bells lost another one in
court today in an attempt to over turn provisions of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 which are effectively
preventing from entering the long distance business.  Under
the Act, the Bell companies are prohibited from offering
long distance service to their local customers until they
have opened their local networks to competitors (Reuters).
Though this is beneficial for all long distance carriers,
WCOM appeared to be an indirect beneficiary of AT&T news.
Today's volume was 20% over average, a very good sign.  We
look for WCOM to test and break through resistance of $79,
having cleared $76 easily.  The more conservative play is
to wait until it breaks $79 and holds.  But in light of the
telco sector's momentum, we can make a case for jumping in
after confirming market direction.  Just don't try to catch
a falling knife if profit taking sets in.

T $91.50 +7.25 (+7.25)  Welcome to what seems like
the newest Internet play.  Michael Armstrong, AT&T's
chairman, is trying with measurable success, to turn the
Queen Mary on a dime, from a copper-based dinosaur to a
broadband fiber based communications powerhouse.  AT&T is
actually a big beneficiary of @Home's offer to purchase
Excite.  Here's why:  @Home's largest shareholder is TCI
who is about to be absorbed into AT&T.  With Excite, AT&T
now has a substantial "portal" to the Internet which can be
delivered over TCI's cable infrastructure.  AT&T had, from
what we could tell, its largest 1-day gain ever on volume
exceeding the average by 80%.  Resistance has been
obliterated.  The sky is the limit, market pending.  Watch
out for profit taking on such a large 1-day run-up, and buy
the dip.

MSFT $155.63 +5.88 (+5.88)  MSFT blew away earnings
estimates true to form, by posting a fiscal Q2 net of $0.73
a share, well ahead of the First Call mean estimate of
$0.59.  Revenues rose 36.8% to $4.9 billion.  As of this
writing, we have heard no news of a split just yet.  But in
after hours trading, the stock was up $9.00 in the $164
range.  For those of you with a position held over earnings
(which we normally don't recommend), congratulations.
Remember to protect your profits with stop-loss/stop-limit
orders.  Also, don't use a market order to enter a play in
the morning, you could be filled at the high of the day.
Instead, if MSFT sells off in the first 30-45 minutes of
trading, enter the play on the rebound.

PICK NEWS CONTINUED
**********************************************************
TLAB $84.63 -1.31 (-1.31)  No news to be found on
TLAB today, just old-fashioned profit taking on 1/3 less
than average volume.  This really is a "buy the dip"
opportunity.  We still like TLAB and expect further gains
when investors de-couple from today's Internet magnet.
Confirm upward direction before entering a play.

DIS $36.50 +.50 (+.50) Disney edged a little higher today.
A judge dismissed the $20 million that had been awarded to
Children's Broadcasting Corp. when Disney ended it's
agreement to sell national advertising for a Children's
Broadcasting deal with AAHS World Radio.  Meanwhile,
Infoseek, Disney's partner in the Internet portal GO
NETWORK (and 43% owned by Disney), has completed its
acquisition of Quando, another Internet company.
Infoseek's Ultraseek Server powers the web site search
capability of many top private and state universities, as
well as several corporations.  A report shows a drop of 1%
in all theme park attendance in 1998. However, for Disney,
that may not be too great a cause for concern. Its Magic
Kingdom saw a 23% jump in attendance only the year before.

NOKA $144.00 +5.38 (+5.38) Nokia blasted to a new intra-day
high today of $145.75, and set a new closing high as well:
$144.00.  Nokia has chosen to use the high performance,
highly secure processing products made by Chrysalis-ITS.
Separately, Dolphin Telecom, of France, has chosen Nokia to
supply and install the infrastructure equipment for its
Tetra digital wireless communications network in France.
Nokia plans to double production of mobile phones at its
plant in Bochum, Germany to meet increasing demand. The
entire telecommunications market is hot now, and Nokia is
one of the top ten providers of telecommunications products
in the world, and the leading maker of cellular phones.
Looking strong, Nokia is also a split candidate.

MU $73.00 +1.69 (+1.69) Micron gained $1.69 on the day,
even as Novellus dropped after reporting earnings only in
line with analysts' expectations. The pre-earnings run-up
for Novellus had been driven by investors' expectations.
Robert Maire, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin, and
Jennette, issued cautious statements about the semi-
conductor industry. He believes that it has not started a
full recovery yet and chip stocks are ahead of themselves.
Intel and Micron must not have gotten the news, for they
were both up today.  Intel's numbers showed a 12% surprise,
and Micron is reportedly doing well this quarter.  MU's
current quarter doesn't end until February, though, and
earnings won't be out until March--enough time for a bit of
an earnings run.

PRIA $35.50 +1.00 (+1.00) Up a full dollar is a decent rise
on a $35 stock.  In fact, this stock was only down one of
the last 5 trading days, and that was on a down market day.
PRIA has been steadily climbing since its early December
correction and it looks like it intends to keep going. The
same factors helping the semi-conductor industry will help
drive up this stock: increasing demand for computers and
other equipment that use chips, and a decrease in the
formerly overabundant supply of chips.

LXK $102.38 +4.31 (+4.31) LXK had a stellar day today with its
rise of 4%. This seems to be a pre-earnings run. We have
noted in past commentaries that LXK has had earnings runs of
an average of $6.00 over the last four quarters. It seems that
this quarter will be no different. There is added expectation
that LXK will announce a split. We have the earnings date as
January 25th. If we hear different we will update you. LXK had
an interesting article written about it's trials in selling
printers to China. The problem wasn't the printers themselves,
but the paper they were printed on. The paper was so difficult
that LXK sent reams of paper to their researchers and told them
to develop a printer that would print on the ancient paper. Shows
the extent at which companies are willing to go in this world
economy.

ATI $92.63 +9.25 (+9.25) ATI did as expected and gapped open
on Tuesday. The open was $95.75, over $3 above the close of
the day. ATI and VOD have stated the deal needs to be completed
by December 31st, 1999. The deal states that ATI shareholders
will get 1/2 share of VOD plus $9 in cash. This will cause the
value of the deal to change as time goes by. ATI is obviously
trading well below the true value of the deal, but this is
common until the deal is finalized.  If you want to play
the rest of this deal (since currently ATI should be worth
$101.25 based on VOD's close today):

*We suggest waiting for the next dip.
BUY CALL FEB-85 ATI-BQ OI= 6868 at $10.00 SL=7.50 ITM $7.63
BUY CALL FEB-90 ATI-BR OI=10024 at $ 6.88 SL=5.25
BUY CALL APR-90 ATI-DR OI=  658 at $ 9.25 SL=6.75

LU $114.06 +3.81 (+3.81) LU had a pretty good day on Tuesday
and closed just $.75 off its highs for the day.  We are now
just $6 from LU's 52-week high.  We have verified LU's earnings
date.  Earnings will be announced before the market opens on
the 21st of January (this Thursday). We are seeing a nice
earnings run which should continue until the earnings release.
Watch for pullbacks to initiate new plays. There are always
times to purchase, just be patient and buy the dips.

XIRC $42.00 +2.13 (+2.13) XIRC shot up today on the expectations
of it's earnings announced after the close today. We had the
earnings date as January 21st, so we apologize for the mis-
information.  For those of you that are holding XIRC, the
earnings came in at $.39 a share.  This is $.04 more than
estimates and a penny ahead of the whisper. If anyone is
thinking of buying into XIRC, wait for a pullback after the
gap open.  XIRC's earnings were $.11 same quarter last year.
XIRC unveiled high-speed ISDN data support for its Global-
Access RealPort Ethernet+Modem and modem-only integrated
PC cards. This technology connects notebook PCs at 128Kbps.

COF $131.50 +1.06 (+1.06) COF announced earnings today and
they came in right on estimates of $1.04. This originally
pushed shares of COF down slightly. As the day played on,
COF traded up and ended up at its high of the day. The whisper
number was the same as the estimate. COF is sitting right
around its 52-week high. If the market continues to trend up
then COF should be a leader. Their earnings rose from $.86 a
share in the same quarter last year.  We were a little bit
disappointed that they did not announce a split.  We are
guessing that COF's management does not have a split clause
in their compensation.  They receive some pretty big bonuses
if they can get COF's share price to $175 within the next
2 1/2 years.

CHKPF $55.50 +4.25(+4.25) CHKPF took off today and closed just
1/2 a point off its intraday highs. CHKPF blew by its prior 52-
week high on strong volume. CHKPF's earnings are on the 21st,
and we are seeing the effects of an earnings run. CHKPF has
historically blown away earnings estimates. CHKPF's last five
earnings surprises have gone like this: 13,22,28,23,78. These
are percentage surprises. Numbers like these cause an earnings
run. Though a split isn't eminent, they do have shares to do
a split.

ETH $49.56 +.63 (+.63) ETH traded in a range of $49.13 to $50.75.
Not a bad day considering that ETH is not in the technology
arena.  ETH announced earnings on the 13th of January and beat
estimates by $.02.  The general feeling out there is that
furniture stores had a great holiday season.  ETH is still $17
away from its 52-week high.  This leaves a lot of room to go.

YHOO $323.00 +6.00 (+6.00) YHOO had an interesting day.  YHOO
opened at $340, which was a premium of $23 above Friday's close.
YHOO traded as high as $345 and as low as $318.  YHOO got it's
boost from the purchase of XCIT by @Home.  This has stirred up
speculation that other consolidation is in the works.  YHOO has
had a strong correction over the last week and this could be
the start of a new Internet frenzy. This remains a risky play.
Wait for upward confirmation.  YHOO continues to be a blue-chip
of the Internet.  The price of Exodus Communications rose 34%
from the mention that it is in a deal with YHOO. Remember, YHOO
has a split coming up at the end of the month (about 3 weeks).

F - Ford Motor Co. $63.94 (+1.94)

Everyone knows who Ford is and what they do, but did you also
know that Ford is not only the second largest producer of
cars and trucks but is one of the largest providers of
financial services in the world?

Not over twenty years ago, certain analysts had all but
the nails in the coffins of the U.S. Automobile Industry.
"A dying industry" it was said to be, "no innovation", a
"lack of direction", "inefficient".  Let's get back to reality.
Ford Motor Company has taken on a huge European market and
done quite well thank you.  Their recent acquisitions of an
aluminum stamping company, the assisting of Poland, which is
the second largest auto production country in Eastern and
Central Europe.  Plus recent media reports of Ford taking
a 10% stake in Nissan.  Almost forces you to take notice of
a company with all this potential.  We have and we are adding
Ford as a new play.

First call has Ford reporting earnings on this Thursday,
Jan. 21, while we don't recommend holding over earnings,
this play has a couple of more days of a possible run up to
the announcement.  If it posts a positive surprise, you may
want to consider jumping back in if you miss the run up.

COMBINATION PLAYS   Merger-mania dominates the telecom group...
******************************************************************
U.S. markets closed higher Tuesday and the Nasdaq hit a new record
high amid optimism about President Clinton's State of the Union
address tonight. The DOW closed up 14 points at 9355 after falling
significantly earlier in the session. Internet/Tech stocks soared,
driving the Nasdaq up 60 points to 2408.20. Traders said rounds of
program trading linked to stock index futures sent stocks lower in
the early part of the volatile session. Post-market earnings and
positive expectations forced investors to speculate in afternoon
trading and that led to a closing frenzy. Traders and analysts are
amazed that investors continue to demonstrate bullish sentiment on
Technology, Internet and Telecom issues.

Our portfolio was quite active, first the new plays: ABI was our
conservative bull-call spread (FEB45C/50C) and the prices near the
open were favorable at $2.87 debit. HUM was the calendar/time play
and the opening price for the MAY20C/FEB20C was $1.25. GMSTF moved
higher right away but there was an opportunity near 10 am to fill
the spread (FEB40P/45P) at $0.50. ELN surprised us with a morning
rally but the best we could manage without "legging" in was $0.75
credit for the FEB80C/75C bear-call spread. COF wandered for most
of the day, the average price for the FEB105P/110P credit spread
was $0.62.

Other activities: We closed the ATI (LEAPS/covered-calls) spread
just after the open for $9.50 credit. There just wasn't any reason
to risk a loss with a successful merger (shrinking volatility/time
values in the options) expected to occur. LU was another morning
exit and we closed the debit position for $3.00, (a $1.25 profit.)
FTL finally started moving again and the positive activity offered
an easy exit for our FEB15C/20C bull-call spread. A closing price
of $2.38 was available and after watching it fall last week, we
decided to take the safe route; $0.87 profit. LUV was up almost $2
at one point and the FEB22C/25C spread closed easily for $2.25 to
achieve a profit of $1.00. OXHP was a calendar position and we
opened the FEB20C at $1.25 against our existing MAY20C for a new
debit of $1.50. WCOM was another open calendar spread and we sold
the FEB75C for $5.25 to reduce the cost basis on our LEAP to $5.62.
NXTL was the final play and our GTC limit of $5.00 was filled near
the end of the day to close the call option. A profit of $2.12 was
the overall outcome for the position.

Other notable portfolio movers included: GM, up almost $5.00, SUNW
up almost $5 and CPQ was $3 higher on news of a possible Web-deal.

Today's plays are mostly speculative positions based on smaller
Internet and Telecom stocks. That's where the action is right now
and the speculation is fairly cheap...

PTEK - Premiere Technologies  $11.38   *** Internet IPO? ***

Premiere Technologies provides enhanced communications services.
PTEK services include 800-based services, voice messaging,
enhanced document distribution and conference calling. Recent
speculation and heavy option volume concerning some of the new
technology from the company. Some say it involves USA.net and the
ability to listen to your email messages and post email via voice
from any touch-tone telephone. PTEK's communications management
technology may be used for their mail engine. Others are betting
that PTEK ownership of Usa.Net and Web.Md will create revenue if
either company goes public. The recent hype of internet IPO's
make this a favorable speculation play, using current momentum
and taking advantage of overpriced options.

PLAY (speculative):

BUY  CALL MAR-12.50 TQO-CV OI=18   A=$1.68
SELL CALL FEB-12.50 TQO-BV OI=2010 B=$1.06

OMPT - Omnipoint  $14.06     *** Telecom Takeover ***

Omnipoint offers digital personal communications services (PCS) to
16 million customers in the US as well as in 30 countries (via 45
international roaming partnerships) around the globe through GSM
(global systems for mobile communications) technology. Worldwide
PCS services are obtained by the use of a subscriber information
access card. Omnipoint also designs and sells phone handsets for
vendor partners including Ericsson, Mitsubishi, Motorola, Nokia,
Northern Telecom, Sagem, and Siemens. Just another small telecom
getting attention as the merger-mania continues. The short term
momentum has this stock over-extended but the risk is worth the
reward if it finds a partner. A March position gives us time to
sell-off some of the initial debit.

PLAY (speculative):

BUY  CALL MAR-15 QTT-CC OI=20   A=$2.25

the whisper number is moving higher. SCUR is expected to maintain
a 30-50% growth rate and now option interest is increasing with
rumors of a stock split. Paine Webber reiterated a "BUY" rating
with a conservative target of $30. The technical outlook is very
bullish with recent support around $20 and heavy buying pressure.

I think it's a good idea since the provisional application is on file - 
Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so 
he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and 
appropriate look and feel (I would guess near the copyright notice and 
roughly equivalent size).

Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from

If you need more, there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a 
new alternative for calculating termination amounts (we heard about it in 
Amsterdam) that I think will be particularly attractive to the energy

Excessive Optimism / Pessimism

Often times when companies release corporate earnings, the stock
will move/gap up or down depending on the level of expectation
built into the stock prior to the release date.  This level of
expectation can be measured, in part, by the Call/Put ratio and is
represented by our Pinnacle Index figure.  The average Pinnacle
Index is 2.0.  Therefore, an index appreciably higher than 2.0
reveals a high level of optimism while an index lower than 2.0
reveals a high level of pessimism.  For aggressive options traders,
we have highlighted companies reaching extreme expectation levels
below:

For example, the company with the highest and lowest expectation
reporting this week is Citrix (CTXS) and Bankers Trust (BT) with a
Pinnacle Index of 15.1 and 64, respectively.  This suggests that if
Citrix does not beat their estimate on Tuesday, they are likely to
sell-off.  Conversely, if Bankers Trust beats their estimate or
reports any favorable news, they are likely to move higher.

The Power of Sentiment Analysis

Last October (1998), Pinnacle Capital Advisors tracked corporate
earnings reports and advised subscribers about the impact that
excessive optimism and pessimism can have on the stocks's performance
following the release of its quarterly earnings report.  If you
recall, we identified several stocks that reached excessive sentiment
levels including Intel (INTC) and Pfizer (PFE).


Reporting                            Estimated   Pinnacle
Date        Company                        EPS      Index
--------------------------------------------------------------
Excessive Optimism:
10/13 INTL  Intel                          .79       5.2
10/13 JNJ   Johnson & Johnson              .70       3.7
10/15 AAPL  Apple Computer                 .49       3.6

Excessive Pessimism:
10/13 JPM   JP Morgan                     1.08        .4
10/12 C     Chrysler                       .87        .7
10/14 PFE   Pfizer                         .57        .9
10/13 GM    General Motors                 .98-      1.2
10/16 G     Gillette                       .30       1.3
10/14 MER   Merrill Lynch                  .56       1.5



The first is Intel (INTC).  The semiconductor powerhouse had
rallied ahead of its earnings report Tuesday night (10/13) and closed
at $83.88.  What's interesting is that they beat the street's estimate
by 9 cents and yet the stock gapped down the next morning (10/14).
And despite the 330 point Dow rate cut rally on Thursday (10/15), the
stock had trouble taking out its recent previous high of $85.88.  Here,
our sentiment analysis alerted subscribers that expectations had gotten
ahead of itself and that despite the good news, the stock had trouble
advancing.

We saw the opposite in the case of Pfizer (PFE).  This blue-chip
Pharmaceutical company had sold off more than 20% from its summer high
($120) to close at $95.50 before its release Tuesday night (10/13).
Here, Pfizer actually missed its estimated earnings by a nickel.
Although the stock initially gapped down the next morning, it quickly
rallied and closed higher. Our message: it's all about understanding
and managing expectations.


Pinnacle Index

What is the Pinnacle Index.  It is simply the put/call ratio at key
overhigh benchmark levels.  Typically, there should be two (2) calls
for every one (1) put.   So when this ratio reaches extremes levels,
it can presage key turning points in the stock.  The average Pinnacle
Index, therefore, should read 2.0.

One of the key components that separate OptionInvestor.com from any
other advisory services is our sentiment indicator or Pinnacle Index.
The Pinnacle Index is designed to measure the level of overhead
resistance at key overhead benchmark levels. This analysis can give
savvy option traders a jump on other traders.

It's important to note that the Pinnacle Index, like many
sentiment indicators, is a contrarian indictor.  This means
that the stock can and will go higher or lower despite what
our sentiment indicators might suggest.  However, our
experience has shown that the market is subject to a
precipitous sell-off if the Pinnacle Index reaches extreme
levels.

Rick Buy asked me to chat with Sally Beck about this and apologized for not 
having consulted with Legal before submitting the report.  He indicated that 
the results were not cast in stone and should not have been characterized, at 
least in connection with legal documentation, as mandates.  Sally has been 
out of the office but promised to call me this week once she had settled back 
in and explain the origins of these suggestions.

Thanks for all the docs - I'll store that in a folder until they make me 
clean out all my files again.

What I really need, though is the current North America versions - which have 
changed since last September.  Does someone down there have a Word version of 
the current ETA and PA for NA?There have not been any revisions to this version.  If someone else needs to 
receive/review, please let me or Leslie know.

Mark,
     I was wondering if you had an opportunity to look up the abritration 
provision that you favor. Any help you could provide would be greatly 
appreciated. Thanks Janet 
As I mentioned in my voice-mail, this needs to go somewhere that users might 
actually see it - e.g. a news ticker story.  Simply adding it to the Legal & 
Privacy Statement, while helpful, is not sufficient.




EnronOnline will assist users, upon request, in arranging for direct access 
connection (such as a "T1" line or other means of direct access) to 
EnronOnline, as an alternative to internet access.   Direct access 
connections might enable users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is 
currently possible through internet access.It turns out they're talking about something completely different.  I can 
fill you in on it next time we get together.

To make matters even more confusing, there are two Mark Taylors.  I believe 
the message you forwarded to me belongs to the Mark Taylor at EI (based in 
London).  Unfortunately, I can't forward your message to him directly (there 
seems to be a problem with the attachment).  If you still have it, can you 
send it to him at "Mark EI.London Taylor"?You're right, we have not agreed to the final sentence with any of our other 
counterparties.  I doubt that the EOL people will let us do it (though we can 
always ask).  I have sometimes gotten counterparties comfortable with this 
issue by suggesting that the master user id and password should be held by 
someone in the back office, the control group or even the legal department so 
that when a trader leaves the master user can immediately shut them off.  It 
seems to me that this puts the risk and responsibility for dealing with 
rogues where it belongs - why should we be at risk if one of their traders 
decides to damage the company?  Having said that, I think that even without 
the last sentence requested we are probably in that position - if we have 
actually received the notice and request for termination of the password and 
don't do it, it would be very hard to defend if we kept doing trades and they 
can show they weren't authorized.

Section 6(a) shall be revised to provide that Enron shall use reasonable 
efforts to cancel CP's master user password and/or user IDs upon receipt of 
notice from CP.  Notwithstanding anything in Section 6(e) to the contrary, 
all such notices must be sent by certified mail to Enron at the following

EnronOnline is conducting a pilot program involving direct access connections 
(such as a "T1" line or other means of direct access) to EnronOnline, as an 
alternative to internet access.   Direct access connections might enable 
users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through 
internet access. My back office suggestion is that the master user id and password be held by 
the back office.  The master user has the ability to open and close sub-user 
(i.e. individual trader) user ids and passwords.  So if a trader leaves, the 
back office master user can immediately turn off the user id for that trader. 
 They can react much more quickly than we can and certainly faster than 5 
days.  I suppose the remaining risk there is that the back office person is 
the disgruntled employee.

		 Subject: Re: Kennecott ETA

I agree that it's their responsibility for dealing with rogues.  However, 
Kennecott's position is that all they can do is notify us and rely on us to 
cut off access once they terminate an employee.  They cannot ensure that the 
employee doesn't write the password on his or her palm to take it with them.  
Apparently, they have had some bad experiences with disgruntled traders.  
Thus, their proposal that their notice must be by certified mail and the 
proviso that we have 5 days to act on the notice.

I have a question regarding the back office suggestion -- are you suggesting 
that no individual trader be given an id but rather you give the id to 
someone in the back office and the trader has to call that individual to 
actually submit a trade.  If that's not what you intend, even if the back 
office or control group holds the password, if the trader knows the password 
to get into EOL, what's to stop him or her from continuing to access EOL 
after leaving the company.  The back office can notify EOL that the password 
should be cancelled, but if we don't act on the notice, what is left for the 
CP to do.

Who should be my EOL contact on this issue and other ETA issues?

The only changes were in the definition of Floating Price - otherwise this is 
the same as the "no-out" version we prepared last week.
Sally did not realize that the recommendations as drafted had referred to the 
master agreement process at all.  She indicated that if she had noticed that 
she would have deleted the reference and will revise the recommendations to 
that effect now.  The net result is that the only change regarding financial 
trading documentation will be to designate someone on the confirmation desk 
in Calgary to handle derivatives confirmations.  Jeff Sorensen will 
coordinate with Peggy Hedstrom.I will be leaving at noon on August 4.  Please add to the calendar.Any chance you can help with this?

Prepay team;

Here's the latest on the restructurings that we thought we might be doing 
earlier in the week:

Molly and Chase have worked out an arrangement whereby we can post collateral 
under the existing deals without adversely affecting our cash position.  
Therefore a fast-track restructuring will not be needed at this time.  Chase 
and Teresa will negotiate an addendum to the credit annex allowing us to 
re-hypothecate collateral, and Molly is currently working out the operational 
issues associated with doing so.

We still intend to restructure the existing deals over the next few months or 
so; I'll advise as we get closer.

Best-
Davis

It depends on what we need it for - if it is just to get the counterparty's 
financials, the Credit Group has a form they can send out without legal

Subject: Workload Responsibiities in Argentina

Andrea and Fabian;

Over the past few days, Randy Young, Mike Guerriero and I discussed the 
proper manner to have the both of you working as an integrated legal team in 
Argentina.  According to Mike, the below listed activities are being pursued 
in Argentina:

Wholesale Origination
Retail Origination
EES
EnronOnline
Power Trading
Gas Trading
Weather Derivatives
Energy Finance
Networks

Although I would be comfortable to leave the workload division up to you, I 
would like to suggest the following (bearing in mind that there is never a 
clear understanding about "where you draw the line"):

Andrea:  Wholesale and Retail Origination; EnronOnLine; Power and Gas 
Trading; Weather Derivatives; Energy Finance.
Fabian: Wholesale and Retail Origination; EES; Energy Finance.

Please correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that there is not a 
significant difference between Wholesale and Retail Origination deals in 
Argentina.  In view of this, I would suggest the two of you assist all 
Origination deals (regardless of being a Wholesale or a Retail deal).  Also, 
both of you should be involved in Energy Finance as I believe such deals 
would arise from Wholesale and Retail Origination transactions.  In short, 
both of you would do legal support to "Origination", however, Andrea would 
focus on Trading and Fabian would concentrate in EES type of deals.

In addition, Fabian would manage Luiz Watanabe's workload in Argentina, but I 
would leave this to Luiz to structure and implement.

Kindly let me know if my thoughts make sense to you and please return to me 
with your comments asap.

I have not made any reference to "Networks" as I have no idea what it relates 
to ...  Is this related to Enron Communication ?

As a final note, please be advised that our baby should arrive on Thursday, 
July 23.  As of such date, I will be available by e-mail and cel phone only.

Rgds,

Sami


I believe I approved this yesterday.  If further action is required, please

Sorry about the delay.

I know we subscribe to various information services from Bloomberg and 
Reuters, but I am not aware of any relationship we have with Thomson 
Financial - then again that's not too surprising.  I suggest you talk to the 
people in investor relations and maybe the Info Central people who may have 
subscribed to such services.  The only way I would have heard about them 
would be if they were to be used for EnronOnline or in the highly unlikely 
event that they had consulted me on the subscription contracts.  Please feel 
free to call if I can be of any other help.

		 Subject: FirstCall Information Service

Mark

I understand that you oversee the legal issues/contracts relating to our 
financial trading activities and consequently was hoping you might be able to 
assist us in regard to the following query that relates to sourcing data from 
external financial information providers.

I work in EnronCredit.com as a Telecommunication analyst and am interested in 
accessing the above information source which is provided by Thomson 
Financial.  FYI, "FirstCall" allows online realtime access to a wide variety 
of debt and equity focused investment house/broker reports.

We originally had access via a trial that was apparently initiated by a "C. 
Weber" who was based out of Houston but who has subsequently left the company.

Unfortunately, access to this service has been withdrawn by Thomson Financial 
here in London on the basis that we are a "corporate" and not a "financial" 
or "fund manager".  Thomson Financial are now offering us a reduced 
time-delayed service ("Investex") which is not sufficient for our needs and 
consequently we would like to reestablish the FirstCall service or a service 
providing similar or superior functionality.

Prior to meeting with Thomson, I would very grateful if you could enlighten 
us on any of the following:

- Whether Enron has any relationship and/or agreements in place with Thomson 
Financial in the US;
- If the latter is the case, which services we receive from this data 
supplier;
- If this is not the case, which alternative but similar data services we do 
receive.

I believe that if we can establish that we already receive the FirstCall 
service in the US it would greatly strengthen our case for receiving it here 
in the UK.  Alternatively, if we do not receive this service in the US it 
would be extremely valuable for us to know what alternative, but similar, 
sources of information are available, in order that we might have another 
option should Thomson Financial prove to be inflexible on the issue of 
supplying FristCall.

Should you have any queries in relation to any of the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me either by return or on the direct number below.

Thanks for your help with this.

Regards

Here is the FSA letter with my comments inserted in red.  I have tried to 
make it a bit stronger by deleting references to our positions being merely 
"arguable."  The language I deleted in the first part of 3.4 I thought was 
unnecessary and just point out doors that may remain open for the SFA.  The 
language added in 3.5 was an attempt to show how much EEFT does vs. 
EnronOnline.

Is there a reason we are referring to Net Works rather than EnronOnline LLC?  
It is also a Delaware limited liability company.  Are we afraid it may have a 

I also wonder if the discussion of EPOL's involvement in 2.2 and 4.2 is 
really needed since the ETA is entered into on EEFT's behalf.  If this has 
not yet been raised by the SFA, it doesn't seem necessary to flag it for 
them.  My position would be that EEFT is a party to that agreement whenever 
it is necessary in connection with an investment.

		 Subject: Stopped anti-energy amendment!!!

Today we were successful in killing an amendment that was offered by Rep. 
Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) in the House Banking Committee during its markup of 
the Commodities Future Modernization Act of 2000.  This amendment would have 
stricken language that provided an exclusion from CFTC jurisdiction for all 
non-agriculture transactions (energy, metals, broadband).  The amendment 
failed, largely due to pressure from Enron, by a vote of 20-12.  Rep. Ken 
Bensten (D-TX) joined Chairman Leach in speaking against the amendment.  

In more positive movement, yesterday the House Commerce Committee passed its 
version on the bill including a provision that exempts metal trading 
multilateral trading facilities from CFTC jurisdiction.

Congress goes into recess tomorrow and we will have a better sense on how the 
Rules Committee plans to reconcile differences between the versions of the 
bill later this week.  The Senate is still the unknown.

Call me at any question - Chris

PICK NEWS - CALLS, continued

PRIA $36.25 -.69 (+1.75) Yesterday, PRIA gapped up and set a
new 52 week high of $37.50 shortly after the open. It finished
slightly higher on the day. Today, however, it succumbed to
market pressure and headed lower with the rest of the chip
sector. (We are including PRIA in the chip sector, since it
makes the automation systems that chip makers use in their
clean-room manufacturing operations.) Even though PRI
Automation was lower today, it is still up from its close on
Tuesday, and that shows a lot more strength than many of the
other technology stocks are showing. This stock keeps a low
news profile - it's momentum is what we are watching. Earnings
are January 28th.

NOKA $145.00 5.00 (+6.38) After rising to a another new 52
week high of $155.38 by mid-day yesterday, Nokia sold off,
along with the rest of the market. Today, though, it lost $5.00
in a market that saw most of the telecommunication and tech
stocks sell off sharply.  There was no bad news on Nokia to
point a finger at; investors simply wanted to lock in profits
when they saw the market moving down.  Nokia is supplying the
products that will hasten the coming wave of digital data
transmission over mobile phones.  We are playing Nokia both
on momentum, and as a split candidate.

Earnings are due out before the open on  January 29th, and
that represents a strong possibility for a split announcement.
If it doesn't occur then, we may have to wait until the
shareholders meeting at the end of March.
(We doubt we'll have to wait for the shareholder meeting.
NOKA has unlimited authorization for shares outstanding).

DELL Computer $84.19 -1.13 (+5.19)  Pump up the volume!
The market got that message in yesterday's action sent Dell
up over $3 on 25 million shares.  Average is 19 million.
If Microsoft has blowout earnings, Dell is partially
responsible and should have big earnings too.  Today, Dell
lost just $1.13 on 20 million shares; actually a victory in
light of the 70 point loss on the NASDAQ today (remember
Dell is the 4th most weighted stock in the NASDAQ 100).
Dell still offering little news.  When they do, the news is
big, though (recently) sometimes unnoticed.  For those with
patience, Dell should ultimately give us one of the better
plays, market willing.  Wait for pullbacks, then the bounce
to scale into a position.  Earnings to be announced
February 16th.

CSCO - Cisco Systems $101.13 -4.81 (-0.38)  What goes up
must come down, or so the clich goes.    We stated
Tuesday, "looking strong, but after 3 days of higher
closings, keep an eye out for the dip".  Dip happens.  CSCO
closed flat yesterday at $106.13 after rising as high as
$109 inter-day, at what looked like would be an excellent
week.  CSCO couldn't hold the new high yesterday and gave
up all of this week's profits on 19 million shares in
today's trading.  No analyst has chosen to downgrade CSCO,
but off-handed remarks, like "overextended", pop into news
service comments.  Still an excellent play when fund managers
put that 401K cash to work.  Resistance is $108.  Still a
split candidate.  Look for earnings February 2.

AOL - America Online $141.00 -7.50 (-5.50)  Whoosh!  That's
the sound of the rug being pulled from underneath the
Internet stocks.  AOL suffered too.  Honestly, it could be
a lot worse.  AMZN and YHOO are down approximately 46% and
40% respectively from their highs, while AOL's price looks
more like consolidation.  AOL is sitting near its 30 day
moving average and should bounce off it if the internet
sector doesn't experience complete meltdown from here.
With internets already well off their highs, a lot of air
has now escaped the bubble.  A further huge sell-off is not
as likely.  Bottom line:  AOL has rapidly growing real
earnings from an outstanding Christmas and is a split
candidate at these price levels (over $120).  We anticipate
a split along with earnings to be announced January 27
after 5:00pm ET.  Only 4 trading days left.  We think an
earnings run has got to start soon.  Confirm market
direction backed by strong volume before playing, or target
shoot for a better entry.  Still an Internet; iron stomach
and ice in the veins required. [almost every commentator
about the internet stock meltdown today made an exception
for AOL.  They all felt that AOL would comeback and was
the best play in the entire sector]

WCOM - MCIWorldCom $73.88 -3.63 (-1.18)  Not much news to
report, just Brazil/China/Greenspan jitters and profit
taking.  We still like WCOM as a fast growing
internet/broadband play.  Big Three long distance
providers, WCOM included, are winning court battles against
Baby Bells and eating their lunch in the process.  WCOM is
sitting above support of $72.  Real resistance is at $79.
Weighted at number 5 in the NASDAQ 100 makes WCOM a target
for fund managers with $9 billion in fresh cash.  Today,
Morgan Stanley upped the price target to $95.  Confirm
market direction before playing.  As we said Tuesday, don't
try to catch a falling knife if (more) profit taking sets
in.

T - AT&T $88.06 -3.44 (+3.81)  Tuesday, we cautioned,
"Watch out for profit taking on such a large 1-day run-up,
and buy the dip".  We hope you protected your profits.  The
dip may not yet be over.  AT&T held up relatively well in
yesterday afternoon's and today's sell-off by gaining $0.38
yesterday and losing only $3.44 today, both on heavy
volume.  This indicates real strength since T was up $7.50
in Tuesday's trading - the market could have taken it all
back, but didn't.  Though largely forgotten today, AT&T is
a big beneficiary of @Home's offer to purchase Excite.
Here's why:  @Home's largest shareholder is TCI who is
about to be absorbed into AT&T.  With Excite, AT&T now has
a substantial "portal" to the internet which can be
delivered over TCI's cable infrastructure.  Today Morgan
Stanley raised their price target to $105.  Near term
resistance is $91.75, it's all-time closing high; $96
thereafter.  Wait for market reversal and confirm direction
before playing.

MSFT - Microsoft $158.31 -4.31 (+8.56)  What a day for MSFT
on Wednesday in the wake of blow-out earnings; up as much
as $12 to $167.75 inter-day from Tuesday's closing price of
$155.63. Justice Depart or not, MSFT is firing on all
cylinders.  Look mom!  No material effect on earnings!
Despite giving some back in today's down-draft, fund
managers can't argue with a 73% earnings increase and will
put new cash to work shortly, keeping demand (and volume)
high, which should push the price further.  Salomon Smith
Barney raised their price target to $200 while reiterating
their "buy" rating.   We view this pullback as a buying
opportunity.  As always, confirm market direction before
playing.

TLAB - Tellabs $84.25 +0.50 (-0.31)  No news again, but
we'll take trading volume with a price increase in the face
of overall market loss any day.  That's what we got with
TLAB.  TLAB had a bad day yesterday, giving up a $4 gain
inter-day, to close with a loss of $0.88.  Today was a
different story as TLAB experienced a 21% increase in
volume with a small gain while the rest of the market
headed bearishly south.  Since Lucent exceeded earnings,
TLAB should have a strong showing too, when they announce
after the closing bell January 25.  We surmise that
Lucent's earnings news ($.05 over estimates) coupled with
yesterday's dip presented a buying opportunity continuing
the earnings run.  We think it will run further but caution
against holding through earnings since, 70% of the time,
they fall back after the announcement.  Confirm market
direction before playing

MYG $63.75 -0.19 (-0.50)  Maytag really needs the market to
string a few positive finishes together.  Our rock is
weathering.  Its resistance level of $66.00 isn't far away.
But, market weakness is making the breakthrough a real
challenge.  Maytag is on our split candidate list and
earnings are approaching.  Feb. 4th is the expected date.
Wait for market momentum to aid MYG in ascending to new
heights before scaling into new plays.

SUNW $98.25 -7.13 (-2.19)  Do you want the good news or the
bad news first?  We will go with the good news.  As we
predicted, SUNW announced a 2:1 stock split along with it's
earnings that beat the street by a penny and crushed last
year's Q2 number.  Their net income for the second quarter
also increased 22% over last year's results.  The bad news
is profit taking in anticipation of the announcements dropped
SUNW -$7.13 on Thursday at a trade volume level that was four
times its norm of 6.88 million.  In after hours trading, the
stock continued to fall.  As reported by Joe Kernen from CNBC,
the additional plunge may have been due to confusion.  Some
thought that SUNW would miss the estimates and sold.  In an
article published just today, their CFO predicted months ago
not to expect SUNW to have earnings that beat their first
fiscal quarter.  Others thought that SUNW would crush
estimates since they are in such a hot sector.  Built up
expectations led to disappointment in the reality and may
have contributed to the sell-off.   In any case, SUNW is now
way off its intraday high of $115.75 hit on Wednesday.  Once
investors realize that SUNW is still in great shape, the stock
should resume its upward course.  If the market turns and works
its way uphill again, this pull back could be to our advantage
and a great time to buy on the dip.  Wait to see Sun's upward
trend re-established.

LXK $99.88 3.81 (+1.82) LXK held up reasonably well for most
of the day, but couldn't hold on at the end and lost over 3%.
LXK will announce earnings before market on Monday the 25th.
This date has been confirmed with LXK's investor relations.
We feel there is a good chance of a stock split announcement,
though there are no guarantees.  For those of you that have
watched the earnings announcements this last week, you have
probably noticed the punishment many stocks have taken on the
announcement. It seems many have bought the anticipation and
when a stock fails to beat the expectation, they are being
punished. This makes holding LXK over earnings a risky play.

XIRC $40.75 +.13 (+.87) XIRC held up extremely well today
considering the carnage the NASDAQ took.  XIRC traded as high
as 41.88 before falling off for a small gain.  XIRC did gap
open on Wednesday, but fell with the market. After announcing
great earnings on Tuesday, XIRC should continue to trend
higher, market permitting.  XIRC's 10-dma is around $39.00.
XIRC option prices should deflate slightly for those interested
in buying in.  This tends to happen after an anticipated event
like earnings.

COF $131.00 4.00 (+.56) COF has held up extremely well in
comparison to the market. On Wednesday, COF traded as high
as $140 before closing at $135. COF is an example of a stock
that didn't have the huge expectation to blow away earnings.
This, in turn, gave COF the opportunity to rise after the
earnings announcement. When the market firms, COF should
continue to move higher and should eclipse its high of $140.
COF's 10-dma is around $129.00.  COF's sector sidekick PVN
did well today after beating estimates yesterday.

ETH $48.75 +.06 (-.19) ETH hasn't done much this week, but did
hold strong in a negative market on Thursday.  This strength
was possibly derived from the statements from the CEO that
there is a "tremendous pent-up demand".  ETH also stated they
are targeting a strategy to have quicker delivery.  This all
points toward a positive future. ETH is still $18 from its
52-week high.


PICK NEWS - PUTS

AVT $45.50 -.81 (.75) Stock experiencing continued weakness off of
recent earnings warning. Stock now under short and long-term moving
averages. Lots of overhead. Could to retest 52 week lows at $35
if the stock trades below $45. Tighten protective stop loss - $48.

BAC $65.69 -.31 (1.13) The financial sector under pressure because of
Brazil. Stock gave up -.56 on Tuesday (1/19). Recommend
staying with position while BAC stays below $65.

BDX $36.81 1.56 (2.95) Medical device maker reported a 16 percent
rise in fiscal first-quarter profits, matching wall street expectations.
The company also forecasted faster sales growth in fiscal 1999, fueled
by its prefillable syringe and infusion therapy business. BDX upgraded
by Merrill Lynch. Tighten protective stop loss - $38.

CPB $44.06 .44 (-1.07) Moved up over key $44 level during DOW
sell-off but still under pressure and overhead at $49.
Tighten protective stop at $46.25.

DD $54.25 .25 (2.75) Stock beginning to break down again
under its declining moving average. Tighten protective sell
stop to $56.25.

EK $65.25 2.88 (3.25) Stock gave up another 2.88 today after
Polaroid reported Thursday a 4Q98 loss of more than $75 million,
closing out a difficult year for the stuggling maker of instant
cameras. Stock still trading below key benchmark support of $70.
Stock also downgraded by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

ERTS $46.50 +.44 (-.00) The stock up fractionally during Thursdays
tech sell-off. Still sitting precariously at it 200-day
moving average. Tighten protective sell stop to $49.25. ERTS
Thursday reported 3Q98 results of $1.15 vs. .84. Whisper number
of $1.18 per share for earnings due. Pinnacle believes that holiday
enthusiasm, if any, will be short-lived by the realities of an
increasing complex and competitive market for entertainment software.
If ERTS trades below $44, could retest prior low of $34-39.

HSY $58.00 -1.75 (3.26) Stock breaking down again and
trading below key $62 benchmark. Tighten protective stop to $62.25

LLY $78.06 4.19 (-2.94) A leading healthcare management
services provider recent topped out at its 52-week high of
$91.31 and showing classic signs of a failed rally trading
above its 50, 100 and 200-day moving averages. Stock breaking down
again after recent rally. Stock now just trading
above key $77 benchmark. Tighten protective sell stop to
$80.25.

MCHP $31.18 1.56 (3.94) Stock breaking down again and now trading
below $33. Tighten protective stop to $35.25.

MRK $146.31 -2.56 (-.81) Keep an eye on MRKs key benchmark
at $145. If MRK trades below this key benchmark, it could
re-test support at $136 at its 200-day moving average. MRK trading
very close to key benchmark level after Thursdays market sell-off.

PKN $94.19 -.06 (-1.19) Beginning to sell off after consolidating
tightly in upper range ($90-98). We still anticipate a sell-off and
retracement to $86.

RMBS $86.75 3.19 (2.75). Stock traded lower today after the high
flying chip company whose technology speeds the action of Nintendo
game machines, said its near-term earnings faced a slowdown.

WLA $67.19 2.13 (2.63). Stock traded higher after gapping down
Tuesday (1/19) following Salomon Smith Barneys downgrade. Stock
trading near key $67 support benchmark. Tighten protective sell
stop to $70.25.



NEW CALL PLAYS
**************

VOD  Vodafone Group PLC $190.31 4.31 (+14.31)

The vote is in, and Vodafone Group is the UK's #1 mobile
telecommunications company, serving about four million
customers. It operates analog and digital cellular networks
offering voice communications, messaging, paging, and mobile
data services. Vodafone sells its cellular phone services
through three distribution businesses: Vodafone Retail,
Vodafone Connect, and Vodafone Corporate. The company provides
cellular services in 12 countries outside the UK; international
operations account for 28% of total revenues. Vodafone will
nearly double its size with the purchase of US-based AirTouch
Communications.

For those of you living in a cave or that were abducted by
aliens, VOD recently merged with ATI. The deal calls for ATI
shareholders to receive 1/2 share of VOD plus $9 in cash. Simple
math says it's better to trade the stock that moves point for
point, not a half for a point. Vodafone's phones are owned by
1 in 15 people in the U.K.  The deal with ATI has been applauded
by most, thus the nice run that VOD has had even though it was
the purchaser. VOD took a dip today and this might present a
good buying opportunity. Watch for a direction on Friday.

A European official stated that the VOD-ATI merger is a perfect
fit. The only problem seemed to be in Germany, where both
companies have ownership in competing firms.  VOD has mentioned
they are willing to sell the ownership they have in one of
the companies.  Projected annual sales for the combined company
is around $10 billion.  Pretty impressive.

QWST - Qwest Communications $59.38 -.88  (+3.07)

The Colorado based Qwest Communications International is the
fifth largest local and long distance telephone company in
the United States.  It is also secures broadband
Internet-based data and provides voice and image
communication capabilities to businesses and consumers.
It is currently expanding its reach into Mexico and most of
Europe. In the US, QWST is building its Internet
Protocol-based fiber-optic network which will connect
over 130 cities by mid 1999.

The telecom service sector has been on Wall Street's good
side as of late.  U.S. telecommunication companies are
expected to meet or slightly beat estimates due to the
increased demand for phone lines, Internet access, and
other phone services.  Qwest is projected to announce its
earnings in three weeks on February 11th.  Even though QWST
was set back slightly on Thursday in a weak market, we feel
Qwest has the potential to make a run.  Wait for confirmation
of positive movement before positioning yourself for earnings
movement.  [note: Zack's has earnings date as the 11th.
QWST's investor relations said they have not released a
date yet.]

News:  Qwest has recently formed relationships with several
companies.  The most recent is with Verio Inc.  QWST was
awarded a contract worth up to $60 million to provide Verio
with additional broadband capabilities.  Qwest will also help
Ford, the car company, with its domestic and international
communication needs.  Hometown Connections and Qwest will work
together to provide community owned electric utilities voice
and data telecommunication services.  Qwest will also invest
$15 million in Covad Communications Group Inc, a company that
provides high-speed digital communication services, to extend
its ability to provide users with nationwide connectivity.

COMBO PLAYS
***********
U.S. stocks ended mixed on Wednesday, as technology issues rallied
on Microsoft Corp.'s strong earnings report, but the Dow fell back
from early gains to close with a loss. Investors grew cautious in
the trading session when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
warned that financial markets were still fragile and a drop in U.S.
exports posed a risk to the economy. He said that recent gains in
stock prices may be difficult to sustain, based on the relative
growth of corporate profits. The late session sell-off was boosted
by computer driven trading programs and some technical selling as
the market dropped through support levels. Strong earnings at MSFT
helped push the Nasdaq to a record high. The Nasdaq index closed
with a gain of 7 points after being up 59 points in early trading.
The strength of MSFT's earnings was surprising and welcomed news.

Our Tuesday spreads were all available near the recommended entry
points. PTEK was the first of the speculation plays and the debit
for the MAR12C/FEB12C was $0.50. OMPT was the next position and
the MAR15C/FEB15C spread traded near $0.87 debit for much of the
morning. Our initial entry was slightly better at $0.81. SCUR was
a bullish debit spread and the FEB20C/25C opened and traded near
the target price of $3.50. Our position was not quite as good at
$3.75. The last position was RHD and although the stock price fell,
the debit for the MAR15C/17C bull-call spread remained near $1.12.

Other portfolio activities: LEVL shot up almost $3, allowing us to
take the early exit at $4.38 credit and a $1.12 profit. PCS also
moved $3 higher but that won't help us as it is now in danger of
closing well above the sold strike for this month. Remember, we
lose our edge (in a calendar spread) when the stock price moves
significantly higher in a short time. Both positions become deep
in-the-money with little time value and we have to roll-up to the
next higher strike at the end of the month.

Wall Street stocks fell Thursday as fears over the global economy
reined in the U.S. bull market. High technology issues suffered as
a sell-off in Internet stocks sent the Nasdaq tumbling. The DJIA
closed unofficially down 71 points to 9264.08 and the Nasdaq index
fell 70 points to 2344.89. The Dow had mounted a late rally from
the day's lows, cutting losses by half, before succumbing to the
general malaise. Worries about Brazil, earnings and the trade
deficit got the better of stocks and profit-taking also had an
affect on the downward movement.

On Thursday, the spreads portfolio weathered the storm as did most
of us traders. Some of the positions were obvious candidates for
"double-downs" but none were in danger of being closed-out. The
most significant moves came from AOL, AAPL, and DIS. Although some
positions were down, (SUNW and WCOM) those were actually favorable
when compared to our "sold strikes". Others that survived the day
included GM, PCS and OMPT. Hopefully, it will get better tomorrow!


NEW PLAYS -

Diagonal Spreads - In these plays, the purchased position has a
longer maturity than the written option as well as a different
strike price. Be sure your understand the necessary collateral
requirements (if any) before opening a position.

CTXS - Citrix Systems  $89.00     *** Earnings Slam! ***

Citrix Systems is a supplier of thin client/server application
server products and technologies that enable the effective and
efficient enterprise-wide deployment of applications designed for
Windows operating systems. The WinFrame software allows networked
computers, (even non-Windows-based computers such as Macintoshes,
UNIX machines, pre-Windows PCs, and stripped-down "thin clients")
to run Windows-based applications from a central server. Citrix's
3,000 clients include Sears Tire Centers, Hewlett-Packard Europe,
and Canadian wireless telecommunications provider Bell Mobility.
IBM, Sharp Electronics and Microsoft, (which owns about 6% of the
company) also licenses Citrix's technology.

On Wednesday, Citrix said it earned $0.52 a share in the fourth
quarter, $0.03 more than the consensus estimate from analysts. The
report came after CS First Boston reiterated its "strong buy" on
the compnay but the stock fell $13 anyway. The stock held ground
on Thursday is now trading right at the 30 dma. This stock should
eventually rebound and continue its upward momentum.

RDRT - Read-Rite  $18.93     *** Positive Earnings ***

Read-Rite is the world's #1 maker of magnetic recording heads used
in hard disk drives. It also makes thin-film magnetoresistive (MR)
tape heads used in quarter-inch cartridge tape drives. Read-Rite's
heads, which record and retrieve information from the surface of
computer disks, are sold to disk drive makers as head gimbal
assemblies (recording heads combined with suspension arms) or
headstack assemblies (modules of multiple-head gimbal assemblies).
Read-Rite is increasingly basing its products on high-capacity
technologies such as MR. Key customers include Western Digital
(its largest customer), Quantum, and Maxtor.

On Wednesday, the company posted a profit of $0.02 a share in the
fiscal first quarter. Analysts expected a loss of $0.17, according
to the consensus of six brokers polled by First Call. The company
also reported strong sequential growth in the quarter, with sales
up 31% from the third quarter. Some consolidation is in order but
the stock price looks poised for further upward movement.

LVLT - Level 3 Communications  $44.19     *** Telecom ***

LVLT is a telecommunications and information services company that
plans to build and operate advanced fiber networks across the U.S.
using Internet technology. Acting as a stepping stone for Craig
McCaw will take Level 3 Communications to the next level. Level 3
is developing a national fiber-optic network, which an investment
firm and McCaw-controlled Nextel and Nextlink will stake for $700
million in return for network capacity. Level 3 will use Internet
technology to offer local and long-distance services, provided
initially through an 8,000-mile network leased from Frontier. LVLT
also provides computer outsourcing and systems integration through
subsidiary PKS Information Services. A spinoff of a construction
firm, the company owns large stakes in Kiewit Coal, Commonwealth
Telephone Enterprises of Pennsylvania, and RCN (telecom provider).

The company just announced Tuesday that it will begin providing
select telecommunications services in the Boston metropolitan area
as part of its national city roll-out. The plan is to construct
local city networks that directly serve businesses in 25 cities
within the next three years. The company plans to offer service
capabilities over its own fiber facilities in 50 U.S. cities.
Additionally, the company is currently building an approximately
16,000 mile long distance national network to interconnect these
cities.

Coverage was initiated by Salomon Smith Barney in early January
with an "Outperform" rating.

SEPR - Sepracor  $99.62     *** LEAPS/Covered-Calls ***

Sepracor develops and commercializes improved chemical entities
that are new, patented forms of existing pharmaceuticals. These
products can offer reduced side effects, improved safety, new uses,
and improved dosage forms over traditional compounds. Sepracor is
developing pharmaceuticals to address asthma, allergies, pain,
urological disorders, sleep disorders, periodontal disease, and
depression. It developed Allegra as an alternative to Seldane (the
FDA withdrew its approval of Seldane in 1997). The company is also
developing antihistamines similar to Claritin and Hismanal. SEPR
has licensed to J&J the rights to an improved version of Propulsid
heartburn medication.

Sepracor said last week, it planned to begin clinical trials on
hopefully safer versions of drugs now on the market, including
obesity drug Meridia and J&J's antifungal drug Sporanox. They also
said the ambitious plan signaled determination by Sepracor, which
previously has licensed its patented drug formulations to large
pharmaceutical companies, to conduct its own clinical trials and
thereby become an independent drug developer and marketer.

The fundamental outlook for 1999 is very good and the long-term
chart reflects an excellent bullish pattern.

PLAY (conservative/long-term):

BUY  CALL JAN00-100 LGD-AT OI=4   A=$25.25
SELL CALL FEB-100   ERQ-BT OI=361 B=$5.25
NET DEBIT TARGET=$19.50 TARGET ROI=100%

Note: In the long-term calendar spread, we are reducing the net
cost of the LEAP by the amount of credit from the sale of the
nearer term call. If the near-term call expires worthless, we will
sell the MAR call to further reduce our debit. If your short-term
position is ITM on the last day of the strike, you need to buy it
back so that you DON'T have to exercise the long-term position. In
that case, your LEAP is going up in value also and on the last day
of the strike period, the short call will shrink down to intrinsic
value so you will be ahead in the play even after you buy it back.

The Internets all suffered from circuit failure with investors
today.

Bearish comments from George Soros, Ralph Acompora and Barton
Biggs along with restrictions placed on trading Internet stocks
by the brokerages all worked together to slam the prices back
to last years levels.

Every other news article on CNBC and in my email today was about
the bursting of the Internet price bubble. Think for a minute,
how much would have heard about the overvalued Internet bubble
if it was never reported on CNBC? I doubt it would even be a
topic at the dinner table without their daily "extensive"
coverage. Don't get me wrong. They do a good job reporting on
the market but they have a negative bias toward these stocks.

In any event the leaders all dropped double digit numbers with
the exception of AOL. The largest Internet blue chip, AOL, did
drop as low as -9.50 but had recovered to -$5.00 until the
market drop at the close. It finally settled at -7.50.

AOL has firmly established itself as the favorite of analysts
who follow this group. With 23,000 new subscribers every day
AOL has power. We view this as a buying opportunity before
next weeks earnings.

The real culprit today was profit taking on worries over the
global currency problems. Brazil's lower house passed the
pension reform law last night but the Bovespa dropped -6% at
the open. The Real lost value again on the open market and
started putting pressure on other world currencies. The large
market drop at midday was caused by a rumor that China or
Hong Kong were going to devalue based on losses in Brazil's
currency. The rumor was so strong that China made a formal
statement that denied it completely. (remember my comment
last week about never believing anything from any country
under currency attack. They will say anything to protect their
options.) After the denial the market recover significantly
from the days lows. Fear of the dark manifested itself with
global rumors still circulating and profits still on the
table. Another rumor that Greenspan was going to leave office
also put a scare into the markets. Even though the market
holds it's breath every time My G. speaks, they still respect
the work he has done in the last few years.

The Nasdaq got hammered. The sixth biggest point loss ever.
Down -80 at one time it rebounded in late afternoon to only
-38 but when the bottom fell out at the close it sank to -70.
Put this in perspective. It had just set another record high
yesterday. The Nasdaq was up +215 in the last three weeks.
It has been going straight up since the October 8th lows.
It was due for a sell off.

Chart http://www.optioninvestor.com/marketwrap/0121nasdaq.gif

Remember in the Wednesday commentary on the website we talked
about the Microsoft gap open on earnings. I warned again about
holding over earnings and the dire consequences. I advised
watching LU, IBM and SUNW today for signs of the gap down
effect. The results are in! IBM +2.50 in regular trading,
beat the street by +.02, failed to announce a split and traded
down -7.50 in after hours. Lucent announced earnings that beat
the street by +.04 and issued strong profit forecasts for the
next two quarters. They did fail to announce a split and
analysts felt the current sales were lacking. Lucent dropped
-8.56 today after gapping down -6.00 at the open. SUNW
announced after the close and beat the street by +.01 and
issued a strong profit forecast AND announced a 2:1 split.
SUNW had suffered strong profit taking during the Nasdaq
sell off today and was down almost -9.00 at the low of the
day. The most active stock on the Nasdaq today with 27 million
shares, SUNW closed at 98.63 in after hours trading, gaining
+.38 after the close. Because SUN suffered so much today
and announced a split they did not suffer after hours but
could drop tomorrow. The stock split will help but the
timing is in March, a long way off.

The point here is "everybody beat estimates but IBM and LU
got killed in afer hours and SUNW will probably suffer
tomorrow." It is just not safe to hold over earnings.

The S&P Futures dropped -17 points in the last hour of trading
on global worries. Since the close they are only down -.30.
If we do not have a negative global currency event overnight
then we could get a strong rebound in the morning. The key
word here is "could". We could also suffer another round
of profit taking in front of the weekend. Many traders will
want to get flat before the close so plan your trades
accordingly.


Good Luck

Jim Brown

Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
****************

Thursday, January 21, 1999

Are you Complacent?  Are you Fearless Buying the Dip?

Are any of your long positions unprotected?  If you answered yes
to any of these questions, you are among the growing number who
will feel the sting of the next market sell-off.

Many of our trusted sentiment indicators are suggesting that if a
sell-off materializes, the general investing community will have
NO fear of buying the dip, particularly after the favorable
experience of last October's strong and profitable advance.  But
if the rallies DON'T hold, most investors won't recognize the
trap until it's too late.

Write these numbers down and commit them to memory.

Dow Jones Industrial Average / 9,400
Market Volatility (VIX) / 30.0%

First, If the Dow Jones Industrial average has trouble getting
back over 9,400, begin developing a balanced attack and build
some hedge positions.  The market broke into record territory in
the first week of January on strong volume, yet failed to hold
the gain.  This is a bearish development.

Next, the Market Volatility Index (VIX) is a powerful short-term
sentiment indicator that will help presage what will happen next
in the market.  The VIX closed Thursday at 31.95 - above the 50
day moving average.  Everyday above 30% means that the recent
declining trend on the VIX has been broken.

Pinnacle Capital Advisors was among the first advisory firm to
alert investors that the VIX had violated a key benchmark on
Monday, January 11, 1999 which preceded the 145 point sell-off
the next day.  Pinnacle believes that this action marked the
near-term top.

The final straw will be the value of our Pinnacle Index on the
S&P 100 (OEX) and S&P 500 (SPX).  If these begin to climb, it
means that option speculators are ignoring early warning signs
and buying excessive out-of-the-money call options believing th
at the market will reach higher levels.  This is when savvy and
experienced investors will know its time to go to cash and get
short.

Pinnacle's short-term indicators are still flashing BEARISH
overtones over the near-term so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.  Any questions regarding
market sentiment can be directed at:

The Power of Expectation Analysis

It has often been said that the crowd is right during the
market trends but wrong at both ends.  Measuring and
evaluating the sentiment of the crowd, therefore, can give
savvy option traders a decided edge.

Great Expectations - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors

The Power of Sentiment Analysis

On Tuesday (1/19), we provided a closer sentiment analysis on
companies reporting earnings this week and alerted subscribers
that several companies revealed excessive optimism as reflected
by our Pinnacle Index.  It's worth taking a minute and looking
at how each of the following stock's reacted after they released
their numbers.  All the companies gapped down or sold off
precipitously even though many reported favorable news.  The
bottom line:  It's all about expectations.  Pinnacle Capital
Advisors will be providing another analysis this weekend.

PICKS WE DROPPED
****************
When we drop a pick it doesn't mean we are recommending a sell
on that play. Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.
We drop a pick because something happened to change its
profile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we
don't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.
We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are
unfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we
want them to look at any current pick as a valid play.


CALLS:
******

QCOM $59.50 2.50 (-4.38) Go figure.  QCOM announces great
earnings and beat estimates, and then trades down after the
announcement.  The downgrade QCOM received Wednesday morning
certainly didn't help the situation.  A weak market today added
to the losses.  Since the run into the earnings announcement
wasn't followed through, we are going to drop QCOM as a pick.

DIS $34.56 1.44 (-1.44) We picked up Disney last week
because of its multiple upgrades and because it had become
a bit of an Internet play with its GO Network portal site
launch.  Unfortunately, Disney came late to the party in
the Internet game. The internets have been selling off all
week, and analysts are talking about the bubble bursting.
Although Disney hit $36.00 today, it ended the day at only
$34.56 - down $1.44. We are dropping it for lack of
performance.

YHOO $265.00 22.19 (-52.00) It doesn't seem that YHOO is
ready to reverse paths as of yet.  We just don't see any
news pending that will possibly start YHOO up again other
than its stock split coming up.  This could change at any
time, but a few internet earnings announcements of late have
just met estimates and this just isn't enough to keep these
stocks afloat.  We'll watch for a reversal and possibly add
YHOO back when the split run starts, if ever

CHKPF $40.25 -4.75 (-11.00) Watch out below!!!  CHKPF is being
dropped.  CHKPF met earnings estimates on the 20th.  This just
didn't cut it.  CHKPF has a history of destroying earning
estimates and this just took the wind out of their sails.  The
company also sees 1Q revenues in the single digits.  Though
this may be an extreme sell-off, the near term prospects just
don't seem positive.  CHKPF hopefully didn't catch any of you
off guard when it moved it's earnings announcement up a day.

LU $106.94 -8.56 (-3.31) We can't seem to get this one right.
We have decided to drop LU in case the big drop today was
more than an over reaction.  LU announced earnings before the
open today and beat analyst estimates by a nickel, then
proceeded to go down close to $9. Go figure.  It seems that
investors are concerned about the addition to income because
of some accounting issues with the pension play.  What people
are failing to realize is that this practice was figured into
the estimates and also caused LU to show better earnings in
the past to keep up with competitors accounting methods.  We
feel it's too risky to guess on this falling knife.  For those
that like LU, waiting for a bounce off the bottom could be
very profitable.

ATI $94.13 3.75 (+10.75) Since ATI's price is basically
contingent on the price of VOD, we have decided to drop ATI
and pick VOD. ATI will increase approximately 1/2 of what VOD
increases.  We feel ATI is a still a good play, so don't sell
current holding in ATI just because we are dropping it.  We
just feel we might as well get more bang for the buck.



PUTS:

NONE




PICK NEWS - CALLS
*****************

UTX $113.94 +1.94 (+4.25) UTX reported earnings today of $1.16
per share which beat the estimates of $1.11 per share.  This
represented an 18% increase above the same quarter a year ago.
Strong showings in its aircraft and refrigeration businesses
were factors in the increase.  What probably helped the stock
more than the earnings announcement was UTX saying that it has
hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives for its
automotive components business.  The automotive components
business is consolidating, operating profits are falling and
revenues are flat.  The Street liked that announcement.  After
the gap up this morning, UTX traded down in what looked like
profit taking.  We would wait for some upward movement before
initiating any new trades

CCU $60.00 -$4.25 (-$0.43)  Well now everyone is getting
into the act. CCU announced this week, they had opened up
their 3D interactive mall which allows shopping from
your desktop for just about anything. Actually, it is not
really CCU, but National Media.  National Media is owned
by Jacor who in turn is merging with CCU.  So in an indirect
way, CCU has got it's own Internet play.  They expect 15,000
stores to join them.  The difference in their mall compared
to the others is, each store is downloadable separately,
saving disc space on your PC and your time at the mall.
You will stroll into the mall, go to the store of choice,
pull an item from the shelf and purchase it on line.
Weakness in today's market didn't help us take any big
steps up again, but CCU showed strength anyway.  CCU opened at
its high of $63.50, dropping to $59.00.  The rest of the
market held it back and made it rest on it's support at a
close of $60.00 for the day.

F $62.06 -2.63 (+$0.06) Ford announced it's earnings today,
nearly a 7% rise in 4th Qtr earnings.  F posted its 11th
consecutive quarter of beating the street estimates and
reporting earnings of $1.35 a fully diluted share.  Up from
$1.6 billion or $1.27 a share a year ago. Ford says, they
more than doubled their cost cutting goal by reducing costs
by $2.2 billion last year.  Ford's operating profit was up
10%, this means about 160,000 U.S. employees will receive
profit sharing checks averaging $6,100 on March 3rd.  Stocks
did close generally lower today and F was no exception.  F
opened at $64.00 just below it's high of $64.31 finished off
of it's low of $61.56 to $62.06.  We may see a continued up
trend after the market digests the figures and regains it's
momentum.

FTL $17.81 -$0.31 (+1.13) What is going on with FTL?  We're
asking the same question. Wednesday's and Thursday's call
options again, showed signs of increased volatility.  Some
take over plays happen over night, and others want to tease
you into doing something rash.  We peeked in on the insider
trading and found none to speak of.  In some cases the
principles are advised not to do anything that would cast
suspicion, one way or the other if something is in the
works.  On todays' trading, FTL had a good open at $18.25,
clawed its way to $18.75 amidst a downturn in the S&P and
settled at $17.81 for the close. Be careful, with a weak
market, even if this is a takeout, it could be postponed
for a better time and price.

EMC $96.00 4.00 (-4.06) EMC set a new 52 week high on
Wednesday, and then started trading down.  It tried to recover
towards the end of the day today, but to no avail.  In the
news, Staples, the world's largest operator of office
superstores, announced that they have standardized their data
storage needs on an EMC system.  The reasons they gave were to
more effectively manage rapid business growth, reduce
information management costs, and improve customer service.  We
have done some more research into EMC announcing a split with
earnings next week, and it doesn't appear likely.  They do not
have enough shares authorized and their shareholder meeting is
not expected until April.  Repeat  No split announcement
with earnings.

MU $69.81 3.19 (-1.50) Almost the entire tech sector was
down today.  Intel, Texas Instruments, and Micron Technology
all lost ground.  ALTR suffered from two downgrades, even
though it's earnings beat consensus estimates, and that helped
pull the sector lower.  Even upgrades today on both TXN and
MU did not help these stocks.  Warburg Dillon Read raised MU
from hold to buy.  It's analyst, Gregory Mischou, upped his
1999 earnings estimate to $.12 from a loss of $.11, and his
fiscal 2000 forecast from $1.95 to $2.31. He believes MU
could trade up into the mid-90s in the current market. Intel,
which has already invested in MU, has just established a
relationship with Samsung, and may do so with Hyundai as well.
It wants to insure Direct Rambus DRAM production in the
future, and hopes to expand cooperation in the next-generation
memory chip industry.  The Koreans have been drastically
cutting production.  The chip sector is still recovering from
a dismal year, and its turn-around is showing up in increasing
chip stock prices. They may trend lower with the Internet
stocks.  However, confirm upward movement in the sector and
in MU before initiating new plays. Current quarter ends in
February.

JBL $73.13 -.06 (-.75) JBL actually held up pretty well today.
As we discussed on Tuesday, its chart is starting to flatten,
and it looks like its momentum is slowing.  JBL's 3, 10, and 21
day moving averages have all converged at this point.  A lot of
times a momentum stock will base for a period, and then start
its move again.  Wait for confirmation of upward movement
before initiating any new trades.

I have received a bill from LeBoeuf for work done in June on the ACE 
insurance matter for a bit over $36,000.  This included around 23 hours by PB 
Wright ($12,000) and 38 hours by SD Avitabile ($13,000).  Does that sound 
right to you?  I have to allocate this to the business units - should it all 
go to East Power Trading? Please add Sara Shackleton (sara.shackleton@enron.com) from the ENA legal 
dept. financial trading group.

Please be advised, I am planning to take the week of Vacation, 8/7-11/2000, 
unless this creates a conflict within the group.

I will notify, Brenda Whitehead so she can arrange coverage for my desk, as 
soon as I receive your approval.

Thank you for your consideration.

Taffy

I'm sorry I've been so hard to get ahold of lately.  Will you be available 
this afternoon - say around 3:30 or 4:00 (I'm pretty well booked until then).Which makes it hard to call.  If you get this I'm at 713-853-7459 or you can 
e-mail back your number.  Sorry about that.Justin:

Do you know whether we have acquired any companies with CFTC registrations of 
any kind (e.g. Commodity Trading Advisor or Futures Commission Merchant)?  I 
was wondering who was responsible for compliance matters if we have.

I hope you're well and all my best to Fran.

MarkLooks fine to me.

Mark and I are both unable to attend at that time. 

Can we reschedule for either 11:00 or after 3:30 Houston time?

I assume also that Andrea will attend. I would very much like her input, as I 
understand she is the one who raised the enforceability issue.

Subject: EOL Passwords

Mark and Dave,

 Last week, we met with a local "Certifying Company" called GIRE. Their 
service is based on the "Asymmetric Password Method" . We believe that using 
their services in the process of granting passwords to our local clients will 
contribute significantly to the enforceability of our transactions from a 
legal stand point. We would like to discuss this issue with both of you to 
determine if it is worth while to consider this alternative.
Is everyone available at 12:00 noon Buenos Aires, 10:00 am Houston?. Please 
confirm.

Regards

Patrick

Big blue beat estimates but investors turned red on Friday.

The bluest of the blue chips turned red on Friday after beating
analysts estimates. Even though they posted a win on the surface
the numbers behind the numbers painted the true picture. IBM made
$.04 a share on hedging currency. What this means is the currency
of other countries went up in value compared to previous levels
and IBM either made money on their currency hedge instruments or
the currency their customers used had gone up in value over
the value assigned when the deals were first done. If you agreed
to pay 1 million Baht for a computer when the Baht was worth 125
to the dollar and by the time the computer was delivered the Baht
was worth 100 to the dollar then IBM would get a windfall profit
of +20%. The difference between 125 and 100 to the dollar. (The
numbers used are for example only and not accurate) So IBM did
not do anything to earn the extra money except be in the right
place at the right time. IBM also had less sales than expected
which did not go well with analysts.

After the smoke cleared IBM had lost -$17 for the day. -$16 bln
in market cap. IBM accounted for over -70 points of the Dow loss
for the day.

SUNW on the other hand beat estimates by $.01 and announced a
split and only closed down -.44 for the day. It really was not
the fault of SUNW. The Nasdaq was hell bent on following the Dow
down even though it made several nice runs to positive territory
during the day. Sun had a backlog of $770 million in orders and
more coming in every day. The CEO said sales were expected to
increase as much as +20% this year. We expect SUNW to continue
upward with any Nasdaq rally.

The Clinton problem took a hard turn on Friday. With Republicans
starting to defect and looking for an easy way out to avoid more
negative press, the prospects of a dismissal look better every
day. This would help the market some as "no change" is typically
considered good news. The Byrd motion for dismissal is not likely
to pass but it set the tone for the future votes.

The real culprit again on Friday was the fallout from the Brazil
problem. Continued rumors of other countries possibly devaluing
their currencies put a cautious tone in the market ahead of the
weekend. Even though many very knowledgeable analysts said the
possibility of China or Hong Kong devaluing based on the current
Brazil problem was "very, very remote" the more safety conscious
investors were moving to the sidelines before the close. The
Brazil Bovespa recovered from earlier losses to close down only
-131 or -1.8%. All the European exchanges had closed down on
Friday as the increasing worry had investors taking profits there
also.

Is the U.S. market going down as some bears are saying? We don't
think so, YET. Without a "tail wagging the dog" news event this
week we feel that positive corporate earnings will continue to
move the market upward. Interest rates are going to remain flat.
Inflation is flat, the economy is growing. We have no reason to
sell off. The wild card is the Brazil crisis. The DOW, OEX and
RUT are all sitting at support on their moving averages. The
market is down -522 points in the last two weeks. We are due for
another technical "relief" rally this week. With all the negative
news out Friday the fact that the Dow only lost -73 points (if
you take out IBM) is remarkable. The Nasdaq had recovered from
a -38 point early loss and traded +15 until the end of the day
"fear of darkness" sell off. This is remarkable. The buy the
dip mentality is alive and well. There was strong buying at the
close on Friday as well as the early morning dip. As long as
buyers keep filling in the holes we will continue to build a
stronger base here. Again, the wild card is Brazil and the other
Latin America countries. A news flash on Monday morning could
wipe out the market in a heartbeat. Until the Brazil Real gains
some strength traders should consider playing smaller positions.
You can still capture some gains but have less at risk should
lightning strike.

We are at a pivotal point in the market. With all the major
averages setting on support it will take more bad news to push
us down and less good news to make it go up. There is still
lots of buyers in the market. As CNBC reported Friday there
is a huge "book" of buy orders at $2-$3 less than current prices
for many blue chip stocks. As long as these limit buy orders
stay on the books the chances of a substantial drop are slim.
Institutions want to buy but not at the top of the market. They
are using the "target shooting" approach we always suggest.

The target shooting approach to opening a position is simply
placing a limit buy order at -25 to -50% less than the current
ask and waiting for a dip to fill your order. Sometimes you
can wait days for a dip but in the current market climate we
are seeing dips almost every day. Normally the dips are too
quick to react with manual orders but if you have an existing
limit order you can get filled when it happens and sometimes
at the low for the day. For instance the SUNW FEB-100 Call
had a low for the day on Friday of $5.00 and a high of $8.00.
It closed at $6.50. The previous close was $7.50. A limit
order for -25% less than the previous close would have been
$5.63. You would have filled at $5.63 and could easily have
sold again for a +15% to +25% profit.

The AOL-140 Call closed Thursday at $14.00. A -25% limit order
would have been $10.50. On Friday the low for the day was $10
and the high was $14.88. You would have filled at $10.50 and
could have easily sold again for +20 to +30% profit the same
day.

Most traders would have bought at $13 or more after AOL started
back up. They would be thinking. OK, now it is moving, I will
jump in now. While this is not a bad idea it is not as good
as buying cheap. Once you make a decision to buy AOL or SUNW
or whichever stock you want, then the next decision is WHERE
to buy. If you use this method you will make fewer plays
because not all options will dip -25% in one day but the plays
you do make will be much more profitable. You will normally
be buying in at the low for the day. Would you like to be in
a position cheaper than everybody else?

We have had several serious rumors that Microsoft is going
to announce a 2:1 split this week. While the MSFT CFO had
said in an offhand remark several weeks ago that he would
"like to wait" until the $200 range before they split again,
I am being covered in emails that claim they will split
either Monday after the close or sometime during this week.
I have never had the volume of email on a split rumor that
I had on MSFT this week. I own MSFT currently and would
really be a happy trader if this comes to pass.

Watch the news Sunday for signs of the Brazilian flu and
plan your trades accordingly for Monday.


Good Luck

JIM'S PLAYS

The week started out great with Microsoft blowing away earnings
and gapping open the next day. I had broken a cardinal rule and
held over in anticipation of a split and got the earnings gap
as a surprise. THIS IS A VERY BAD IDEA!! I was forced to hold
some SUNW over earnings as the market was dropping too fast
and my limit orders never filled. Ouch! Fortunately Sun did
not do the IBM thing and actually traded up on Friday. If we
can get a Nasdaq rally Monday I might be able to get out of
the position alive. Other than the those two major trades
early in the week I did almost nothing. Friday I bought the
dip on faith and still feel pretty good about it. Now if
only Brazil does not blow up over the weekend.

This looks like a pretty good week but what you don't see
is the large loss I am currently holding in SUNW. If Sun does
not rise from the ashes this week the next Sunday recap will
be very ugly.

Market Sentiment
By Pinnacle Capital Advisors

Market's Momentum Lost

Don't look now, but the powerful market has lost its momentum and
we are beginning to see several classic failed rallies develop.
You would expect the financial and airlines sectors to roll over
given that these have been under pressure and trading below
their declining moving averages.  But what about Drug and
Healthcare? These sectors have been trading higher and should
follow the Technology sector into new territory, right?  Wrong.
Pinnacle turned Bearish on these sectors this weekend over the
near-term after violating key benchmarks of (DRG /740) and (HCX
/ 720), respectively.

More problematic is the Russell 2,000 (RUT). Not only is the
small cap coming up short of last July's high, but excessive
call buying by option speculators is occurring at out-of-the
money overhead benchmark levels as reflective by our high
Pinnacle Index (14.7) for the Russell 2,000.

The Power of Expectation Analysis

It has often been said that the crowd is right during the
market trends but wrong at both ends.  Measuring and
evaluating the sentiment of the crowd, therefore, can give
savvy option traders a decided edge.

Great Expectations
By Pinnacle Capital Advisors

Great Expectations

With another wave of key corporate earnings reports due out this
week, we have highlighted below the companies that will likely
have the greatest impact on the overall market.  Keep close
track of these companies.  If they beat expectations, we are
likely to move higher.  If not, we are likely to re-test our key
support levels again.

Options traders playing the Technology sectors, watch Microsoft
on Tuesday.  Microsoft will likely dictate the climate for
the technology sector for 1Q99.

Excessive Optimism / Pessimism

Often times when companies release corporate earnings, the stock
will move/gap up or down depending on the level of expectation
built into the stock prior to the release date.  This level of
expectation can be measured, in part, by the Call/Put ratio and is
represented by our Pinnacle Index figure.  The average Pinnacle
Index is 2.0.  Therefore, an index appreciably higher than 2.0
reveals a high level of optimism while an index lower than 2.0
reveals a high level of pessimism.  For aggressive options traders,
we have highlighted companies reaching extreme expectation levels
below.

For example, the company with the highest and lowest expectation
reporting this week is Realnetworks (RNWK) and Baker Hughes (BHI)
with a Pinnacle Index of 12.2 and 1.0, respectively.  This
suggests that if Real Networks does not beat their estimate on
Tuesday, they are likely to sell-off.  Conversely, if Baker
Hughes beats their estimate or reports any favorable news, they
are likely to move higher.

The Power of Sentiment Analysis

Last October (1998), Pinnacle Capital Advisors tracked
corporate earnings reports and advised subscribers about
the impact that excessive optimism and pessimism can have
on the stocks's performance following the release of its
quarterly earnings report.  If you recall, we identified
several stocks that reached excessive sentiment levels
including Intel (INTC) and Pfizer (PFE).


Reporting                            Estimated   Pinnacle
Date        Company                        EPS      Index

Excessive Optimism:
10/13 INTL  Intel                          .79       5.2
10/13 JNJ   Johnson & Johnson              .70       3.7
10/15 AAPL  Apple Computer                 .49       3.6

Excessive Pessimism:
10/13 JPM   JP Morgan                     1.08        .4
10/12 C     Chrysler                       .87        .7
10/14 PFE   Pfizer                         .57        .9
10/13 GM    General Motors                 .98-      1.2
10/16 G     Gillette                       .30       1.3
10/14 MER   Merrill Lynch                  .56       1.5

The first is Intel (INTC).  The semiconductor powerhouse had
rallied ahead of its earnings report Tuesday night (10/13) and
closed at $83.88.  What's interesting is that they beat the
street's estimate by 9 cents and yet the stock gapped down
the next morning (10/14).  And despite the 330 point Dow rate
cut rally on Thursday (10/15), the stock had trouble taking
out its recent previous high of $85.88.  Here, our sentiment
analysis alerted subscribers that expectations had gotten
ahead of itself and that despite the good news, the stock had
trouble advancing.

We saw the opposite in the case of Pfizer (PFE).  This blue
chip Pharmaceutical company had sold off more than 20% from
its summer high ($120) to close at $95.50 before its release
Tuesday night (10/13).  Here, Pfizer actually missed its
estimated earnings by a nickel.  Although the stock initially
gapped down the next morning, it quickly rallied and closed
higher. Our message: it's all about understanding and
managing expectations.


Pinnacle Index

What is the Pinnacle Index.  It is simply the put/call ratio
at key overhigh benchmark levels.  Typically, there should be
two (2) calls for every one (1) put.   So when this ratio
reaches extremes levels, it can presage key turning points in
the stock.  The average Pinnacle Index, therefore, should read 2.0.

One of the key components that separate OptionInvestor.com
from any other advisory services is our sentiment indicator
or Pinnacle Index.  The Pinnacle Index is designed to measure
the level of overhead resistance at key overhead benchmark
levels. This analysis can give savvy option traders a jump on
other traders.

It's important to note that the Pinnacle Index, like many
sentiment indicators, is a contrarian indictor.  This means
that the stock can and will go higher or lower despite what
our sentiment indicators might suggest.  However, our
experience has shown that the market is subject to a
precipitous sell-off if the Pinnacle Index reaches extreme
levels.

If we can find an attorney in Houston, I would be all for moving forward with 
it.  The truth is that a 2 day delay will not ruin the relationship.  Since I 
am on vacation today and tomorrow, I would ask George to investigate Houston 
lawyers.  George I think we use Mark Taylor but please confirm this with

Apparently we are short of lawyers this week.  Will it be OK to get back on 
this next week or do you want to show it to a lawyer in Houston ?

George and I agree that we should not consider signing the LOI now, but 
should sign the CA so that we can share information and hold further 
discussions to jointly develop the nature of the relationship.  In the LOI 
sent, they are making declarations that we have not fully flushed out, 
therefore, we are not prepared to sign that.

Hope that helps.

Thanks.

Before I get legal and PR to look at this could you give me a bit more 
background on the potential arrangement with NextSet. I dont understand where 
the need for training will come in. 

I know that generally Enron has a policy of not being seen to endorse a 
client's products. PR may therefore have a problem with giving NextSet the 
ability to put our logo on their site. How important is this likely to be ?

Gillian and George,

Thanks again for stopping by this morning.  Per our conversation, I am
attaching a mutual NDA and a standard LOI.  With the former in place, we
should both be able to get a little deeper into the technology to see if
there is a strong fit between our respective companies.  I would be very
interested to introduce our CTO with your technology counterpart the next
time he is in town.  Feel free to schedule that meeting through me.  All the
best.

I saw this on the internet & thought I'd pass it along.....

Eating fish does contribute to your intelligence, particularly before and 
just after you're born. 

A researcher at the University of Connecticut has found that some fish are 
high in a certain chemical that's vital to brain and nerve cell growth in 
fetuses and newborns. 

Babies can't make enough docahexanoic -- or DHA -- a fatty acid that helps 
the brain develop. They must take whatever their mothers give them, either 
through the umbilical cord or by breast-feeding after they're born. And note 
that baby formula isn't fortified with DHA. 

Women who eat cold-water species, like salmon, trout, sardines and tuna, give 
their babies a better chance at maximizing brain tissue development, the 
research found. Other fish high in the chemical are herring, swordfish and 
mackerel. It would be nice if they could give us a counterparty name - I've never heard 
of Jerry Peskuchi.

Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on.

Did you get this?  I didn't see your name on the addressee list.

  Leading online platform signs agreements with HoustonStreet Exchange
and True Quote

  EnronOnline, Enron Corp.'s giant online platform,, has made the first
Commodity in what may become a consolidation of competing electronic
trading exchanges in the energy industry.


  Enron Net Works, the division which operates EnronOnline, last week
signed cooperative agreements with HoustonStreet Exchange and True quote
LLC.

  And industry sources confirm that EnronOnline is negotiating similar
deals with several other exchanges, including Houston-based Altra Energy
Technologies and RedMeteor, as well as e-Speed, an exchange backed by
Dynegy and, Williams.

  HoustonStreet Exchange, headquartered in Portsmouth, N.H., was
recently ranked among the top 20 dependent energy exchanges by AMR
Research, a Boston consulting firm which put Altra in first place.

  True Quote, based in Louisville, Ky.,  a startup trading platform
being developed by APB Energy -- an over-the-counter brokerage firm --
along with PG&E National Energy Group, EnForm Technology and Microsoft
Corp.

  EnronOnline is the world largest commodity trading platform, but users
an only trade with Enron. Rather than being a true trading exchange,
industry insiders describe it as simply an online extension of Enron's
business.

  But in EnronOnline's first six months of operation after being
launched last November, the value of transactions conducted on the,
system surpassed $50 billion at a rate of $1.5 billion a day. The
platform offers trading in a wide variety of commodities, from most
forms of energy to bandwidth and paper

  MORE EYEBALLS

  The agreements EnronOnline has struck will enable the company to post
the prices at which it will buy or sell natural gas and electricity on
HousonStreet.com and TrueQuote.com Neither HoustonStreet nor TrueQuote
prices, however, will appear on EnronOnline. Customers on those two
sites who click on an Enron quote will be instantly linked to
EnronOnline, where the trades will take place.

  "As Louise (Kitchen, president of EnronOnline) said, extending their
pricing to more eyeballs will build more transaction volume for Enron,"
says Paul Bourke, president of Altra. "The question is whether it will
build volume for the other exchanges.

  "We are talking to Enron," Bourke adds. "We are intrigued, and we are
attempting understand what the business benefits to Altra would be."

  He says an Enron-Altra deal would be "more complicated" than those
involving other exchanges because of Altra's significant liquidity in
natural gas. Altra is the leader in online natural gas trading.

  While none of the exchanges would reveal what, if any, financial terms
are involved in the agreements--other than to say there is no sharing of
commissions --Bourke says he expects that if Altra and Enron finalize an
agreement, Enron would take a small equity position in Altra. He
speculates that this is what Enron did with HoustonStreet.

  Brian Pieri, vice president of Red Meteor, says the value of
EnronOnline to the other exchanges is that "they bring' tight-bid
offers, which is something the exchanges have to work hard on. And more
people will make the bid offers even tighter."

  This means buy and sell prices are close together, which helps market
liquidity.

  Asked if the additional liquidity and trading volume that Enron might
bring to the other exchanges wouldn't just further fragment the market,
Pieri compared the whole online trading scene to a sixth-grade dance.

  "The boys are all on one side of the room and the girls are on the
other side, and nobody is dancing. Somebody has to start and then
everybody else joins in. Enron brings more validity to this very new
situation," Pied says.

  "All of the exchanges are trying to build liquidity, of which Enron is
the king," says Bill Swanton, an analyst with AMR Research.

  Swanton predicts that the energy exchanges will consolidate within the
next six to eight months, and the ultimate surviving exchanges will not
be owned by any single player.

  "You need an independent exchange. I can't imagine Enron will end up
running it. The trading community won't be satisfied with that," he
says.

  Swanton points out, however, that Enron "will attract attention they
don't want if they force, some of these guys out of business."

  But HoustonStreet's CEO, Frank Getman, takes a different view of what
the Enron deals mean.

  "Web-based energy trading exchanges are no longer about liquidity,
thanks to these EnronOnline data deals," he says. "The game is now about
functionality and value-added services."

Sorry for the delay in catching up with my e-mails. Yes, MG London Inc is the 
clearing member of NYMEX/COMEX and is FCM & CTA. The only other MG companies 
who have any exchange/regulatory registrations are in the UK and are 
Metallgesellschaft Ltd (LME & SFA, also LIFFE to come), MG Brokers Ltd (LME &

Jon,

Grateful if you could complete the picture for me and for Mark Taylor.    Is 
MG London Inc. the entity that is the Clearing Member of NYMEX + a Futures 
Commission Merchant and Commodity Trading Advisor?   Do any other (MG) 
entities have similar registrations, and if so, what are these?

Thanks

Do you know whether we have acquired any companies with CFTC registrations of 
any kind (e.g. Commodity Trading Advisor or Futures Commission Merchant)?  I 
was wondering who was responsible for compliance matters if we have.

I hope you're well and all my best to Fran.

Position 2 = number of analysts recommending "moderate buy"
Position 3 = number of analysts recommending "hold" or "neutral"
Position 4 = number of analysts recommending "moderate sell"

PICKS WE DROPPED THIS WEEK

Remember that historically, when we drop a pick it will go up
10 to 15% the very next week. It is part of Murphy's Law.
Just because we drop a stock as a pick does not mean we are
advocating a "sell" on any position you have. We are simply
dropping our recommendation as a new play. Existing plays
can and do continue on and are usually profitable.

JBL $70.00 (-3.88) JBL closed under its 30 day moving average
on Friday.  Its chart has flattened out and it looks like it
has lost all momentum.  JBL has had a nice run since October,
but we are going to have to drop them as a pick.

MYG $63.63 (-0.62)  It is time to say good-bye to our
good 'ole friend Maytag.  For the past two weeks, MYG has
struggled in the weakened market.  It sure would have been
nice if Maytag had managed to keep its incredible streak alive.
But, the -143.41 drop in the market on Friday snuffed out any
chance of MYG rallying.  For the first time in eight
weeks it finished with a net negative.  Even though Maytag
announces earnings on Feb 4th and the possibility of a split
remains, we feel that Maytag has lost some of its steam.  We
are dropping it as a pick for the time being.

TLAB $79.63 (-6.31) Ciena, the flea, puts Tellabs in the
doghouse.  Seems like every time we get a good play on
Tellabs, rumors circulate that Ciena is again in
acquisition talks with them.  Ciena goes up $4 on the rumor
while TLAB pays the $4 penalty.  TLAB is still a great
company, but until the Ciena rumor goes away or the market
decides it likes the idea of a merger, we can't recommend a
play.  Thus we are dropping TLAB for now.

COF $128.69 (-1.75) We are dropping COF this week.  COF had
a sub-par week and just hasn't been performing like we would
expect it to.  Providian Financial has performed much better
and is COF's key competitor.  It is likely most of the damage
is sector related.  The banks are always weak whenever there
is economic worries overseas.  COF suffers with them despite
the fact that they have virtually no overseas exposure.  COF
did announced earnings that were right on estimates.

ETH $48.00 (-.94) We are dropping ETH in favor of some quicker
moving plays.  ETH has had a strong run, but has turned down
now for three straight days.  ETH had a nice earnings push and
was able to get as high as $50.75 on the 19th, but since then
has tapered off.  ETH CEO did mention that there is a lot of
pent up demand for their products and when this comes to
fruition, we might see a move to the upside.  Of course this
could just be a consolidation after the strong move.

FTL $17.81 (+1.13) While the possibility of a takeover is
still there, FTL has hit a ceiling in it's enthusiasm.
For the last couple of weeks it's been trading sideways.
We feel it may be stuck in a holding pattern while waiting
on news of an offer.  If you are still interested in playing
you might consider the May options thus giving yourself
more time.  However, if volume is any indication, current
month Febuarys have been popular.  Monday mornings have
become the popular time to announce news of mergers and
buyouts.  Something could be brewing for the Jan. 25th.

F $60.88 (-1.13) After a 10% rise in operating profits,
a 100% increase in their cost cutting success, and their
11th consecutive quarter of beating the street's estimates
and their stock drops almost 4 points.  It is quite likely
that the Dow's 215 drop Thursday/Friday was a catalyst
for the decline but we expected better from this automaker.

CCU $59.06 (-1.37) Dropping 2 days in a row after setting
a new 52 week high, CCU has succumbed to profit takers.
We understand the need for consolidation and pullbacks
after a strong run, but breaking through it's 10 dma is
not a good sign.  Depending on how the market performs
next week, we will either see a large bounce back up
through its 10 dma or a continued slide.  Increased
interest in competitor AMFM's merger or acquisition
activity may drive interest back into this sector but
we are cautious and willing to trade this play for a
stronger one.  Nimble traders should watch for
opportunities.  This stock is prone to strong 3-5-7
day cycle trading.

PUTS:

Eastman Kodak (EK) - $65.50 .25  (-3.50)
Big winner for OI subscribers after stock gave up more than
$15 over the past two weeks.  Stock reached our target of $65
and now trading at prior support level.

Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS) - $47.75 +1.75 (.75)
Stock trading and holding above key support level of $45.
Will revisit play if ERTS violates support.

Eli Lilly (LLY) - $80.25 2.31 (-1.00)
Stock rallied more than $2.00 during Friday's (1/22) broad
market sell-off.  Stock sold more than $15 before firming
above it 200day moving average.  Appears to have found support
at $75-80.

Rambus (RMBS) - $88.69 -1.94 (-.82)
Stock traded up nearly $2 during Friday (1/22) sell-off.
Stock now trading near 100-day moving average.

NETWORKING
**********
CSCO - Cisco Sys. $102.81 (+1.13)(-5.00)(+13.88)(P7W +28.11)

Cisco is the leading networker and is expected to help
build the next generation Internet. Their goal is to allow
people to access or transfer information without regard to
differences in time, place or type of computer systems,
voice or data.  About 85% of the routers used to decipher
and direct data traffic on the Internet are made by Cisco.

CSCO will gain tremendously from the AT&T/TCI merger since
they will build the equipment needed to harness the mass
appeal of broadband services.  Similarly, in an agreement
signed this week, Cisco will provide technology to Daxian
Electronics so that Daxian can build cable modems under the
Cisco brand to develop cable broadband services in China.
China already serves 100 million cable customers, just 10%
of the market.  Wow!  What potential to connect Chinese
citizens with local and long distance phone service,
Internet, data services, video conferencing, etc.  CSCO
will earn royalties from the transaction too.  Also, a
reminder from a Reuters news release, Cisco continues to
grow 35% per year while the market grows 15%.  CSCO is
truly leading the development of the Internet by helping
cable and phone companies complete "the last mile", or the
distance between the cable in the street an your home.

With as volatile a week as we had on NASDAQ, CSCO held up
well.  It is time we watch for CSCO's earnings run.  Plus,
the network giant is once again a split candidate.  They
are due to announce earnings after the close on February 2nd
where we expect them to announce a split.  It's unusual that
they would split so soon after their 3:2 in September.
Historically though, CSCO splits in the $80-100 range and
they have enough shares authorized to give us another 3:2.
Greet price dips as a buying opportunity, confirm market
direction and use stops.  Day trading CSCO can usually earn
you 5-10% on any given trading day (if you pick the right
option), but you have to watch it and use limit orders (target
shooting works too).  If you do, at least be disciplined.

Internet
********
AOL - America Online $140.44 (-6.06)(+0.00)(-8.63)(P6W +83.56)

America Online is the largest online Internet access
service in the world.  Membership now exceeds 15 million
users.  Its Chairman, Steve Case, said more new users
signed up with AOL on Christmas Day than any other day in
the company's history.  With estimates of 16 million users
by the year 2000 and growing advertising revenues AOL has
been called the blue chip of the Internets. (If only they
could get their mail problem resolved!)

A case of throwing the baby out with the bath water.
Almost every analyst we hear from regarding the "long
overdue" sell-off of Internet stocks qualifies it with,
"But AOL is the exception".  This was not a good week
overall for the internets; tough on AOL too, though they
showed good strength in adding back $5 from their $135 
opening on Friday morning.  Frankly, we struggle at times
playing AOL during it's consolidation phase.  We still think
that with earnings just 3 trading days away, with the
expectation of a split announcement, buyers will step in to
raise the price and give us a healthy run-up.  AOL reports
23,000 new customers logging on daily, and over $1 billion
sales through its site for the Christmas season.  Weekly,
they add new advertisers paying dearly for the exclusive
privilege of appearing on AOL.  Ever notice those companies
don't report how much it costs them?  It's a lot and we
expect it to be nicely reflected in an earnings surprise.
AOL is well over historic split territory, usually $120-
$130.  They have enough authorized share to give a 3:1, but
2:1 is more likely. Earning are expected after 5:00 p.m.
ET, Wednesday, January 27.  Given the recent pounding
stocks take after announcing great earnings, we strongly
caution all traders to re-analyze their risk to hold over
an earnings announcement.  Just because we expect great
numbers and a split doesn't mean that their earnings won't
turn sour or that a split may fail to materialize.  Confirm
market direction and use stops.  Intestinal fortitude
required.

In the news this week, Prodigy, once a strong AOL
competitor, threw in the towel on 208,00 subscribers of its
Prodigy Classic service because it will not be Y2K
compliant.  Wednesday, AOL reported that they drew 54.5% of
all Internet users at some point in the month of December.
MSFT trailed by 6 percentage points.  AOL Japan reported
200,000 total subscribers.  The real news, not in print, is
about earnings and possible split.

Telecom
********
WCOM - MCIWorldCom $74.88 (-0.18)(+0.06)(+3.25)(P5W +9.31)

Telecommunications behemoth, MCIWorldCom, is the recent
offspring between a marriage of formerly #2 long distance
provider MCI and #4 provider WorldCom.  Now the newly
formed giant of giants is duking it out with AT&T as they
stake their claim in the local phone service, international
service, cellular, paging, and Internet access arenas.
WorldCom's $37 billion purchase of MCI last September
qualifies it the 7th largest merger or acquisition in 1998.
WCOM is one of the largest Internet backbone providers in
the world.  If you're reading this letter, somewhere in the
transmission, WCOM fiber brought it to you.

WCOM, the 5th largest component of the NASDAQ 100, was down
slightly on the week, which we think is good news given the
Brazil/China/Greenspan jitters.  Buyers stepped in with
heavy volume of 11-18 million shares daily to offer support
in the $73 range.  Average daily volume is 10.7 million
shares.  Technical indicators are not looking so great
right now, except for the strong bounce off Thursday's low.
Resistance is $80.  Market permitting, we expect the bounce
to continue and look for nice profits as WCOM tests $80
again.  If it breaks $80 with good volume, the sky is the
limit.

Noteworthy this week, UUNET, the ISP (Internet service
provider) division of WCOM announced they would be the
service provider for Gateway Computer customer's Internet
service.  Gateway said it chose UUNET because it was the
first company to offer commercial access to the Internet,
and it continues to maintain the industry's most reliable,
rigorously managed and most widely deployed network
(Reuters).  Reuters also noted in a different release that
WCOM was one of Fidelity Magellan's top 10 holdings.
Analyst have also said, "earnings will benefit from the
company's strong position in the fastest-growing segments
of the industry, such as data, Internet and international.
Still getting mileage from award of the GSA contract and
baby bells unfortunate court rulings preventing the baby
bells from entering the long distance market in their home
areas.  This spells good news and continued earnings growth
for the big 3 long distance providers.

QWST - Qwest Communications $60.13 (+3.82)

The Colorado based Qwest Communications International is the
fifth largest local and long distance telephone company in
the United States.  It is also secures broadband
Internet-based data and provides voice and image
communication capabilities to businesses and consumers.
It is currently expanding its reach into Mexico and most of
Europe. In the US, QWST is building its Internet
Protocol-based fiber-optic network which will connect
over 130 cities by mid 1999.

It was nice to see that QWST continued the upward trend it
established early in the week.  We initiated coverage of
this company in Thursday's newsletter.  On Friday, it
affirmed our beliefs by finishing the day up +$0.75 even
though the markets were extremely shaky.  The most recent
date we have for earnings is listed in Zack's as being on
February 11th.  Confirm upward movement before initiating
any new plays.

News:  Qwest has recently formed relationships with several
companies including Verio Inc., Ford, Hometown Connections
and Covad Communications Group Inc.  All of the contracts
formed revolve around improving communication capabilities.

T - AT&T $88.25 (+4.00)(+9.31)(+1.19)

AT&T, the mother of all phone companies isn't just a long
distance company any more. Through growth and acquisition,
they now provide data transmission, video tele-
conferencing, PCS/wireless/cellular, Internet, paging and
local phone services via microwave, fiber and copper
infrastructure throughout the U.S. and international
markets.  Their annual revenues in excess of $55 billion
dwarf their nearest competitor, MCIWorldCom, by 5 times.
Their 1998 acquisition of TCG (formerly Teleport
Communications Group, the nations largest competitive local
exchange carrier) and IBM's data services division will add
substantially to their revenues.  Pending a merger with
cable giant, TCI, revenues could grow even more.  Michael
Armstrong, AT&T's CEO, has investors believing that AT&T is
no longer a copper wire dinosaur heading-up the telecom
extinction list.

This is an earnings and momentum play.  Up $4.00 on a down
week, T is behaving more like a tech stock with $6 daily
swings.  Technicals look great and will look even better
when the market shakes off its jitters.  T traded as high
as $96 inter-day Wednesday to give us tremendous profits.
We hope you protected them from the backslide using stop
loss orders.  Given AT&T's turnaround with Michael
Armstrong at the helm, we think AT&T will show excellent
earnings and revenue growth.  There is some confusion with
earnings announcement date shown as January 26 by Zack's.
This is most likely inaccurate.  First Call lists no report
date.  AT&T shareholder relations says, "between February
23-25".  We'll report it to you when AT&T clarifies the
pictures.  In the meantime, with AT&T's current strength,
dips should be met as a buying opportunity.

Some great news: AT&T may sell it's WorldNet ISP division
to @Home for $1 billion in @Home stock.  At Home would then
fold WorldNet's 1.3 million subscribers into its customer
base of 330,000, with the goal of converting the AT&T users
to its much faster, cable-based service.  AT&T, however,
essentially would retain control of it's online service
because it's about to acquire voting control over At Home
with its pending $41 billion purchase of the second largest
U.S. cable TV operator, Tele-Communications Inc.  TCI owns
a 58 percent voting stake in At Home and 28 percent of its
common shares (CBSMarketwatch).  With @Home buying Excite,
AT&T would then have the content to compete with the likes
of AOL.

For those new to our publication (veterans, please forgive
us), three weeks ago, AT&T got the green light to merge
with TCI thus creating a huge bandwidth pipe (lots of
transmission capacity) over "the last Mile" or that short
distance between the street and your phone jack.  It's
estimated that it costs $1200 per home for a typical
utility to trench and install any transmission equipment.
That's why even though the fiber optic cable runs down your
street, you can't yet access it.  It's too expensive to get
it to you.  Soon, you'll be able to bypass that fiber in
favor of AT&T/TCI cable.  It's already there.  Translation:
increased revenues.

NOKA - Nokia $144.56 (+5.94)(+3.63)

Nokia is a supplier of telecommunications systems and
equipment and is the world's leading maker of cellular
phones. It's telecommunications and mobile phone sales are
growing rapidly, and margins are higher as well.

We dropped Nokia on Jan. 10th as it began a correction and
picked it up again in last Sunday's letter.  It rewarded us
with a 16.81 jump in price by mid-day Wednesday, before
losing two thirds of that to market weakness the rest of the
week.  Nokia was still up $5.94 on the week.  The
entire telecommunications industry is very strong now, as
investors realize that it is one of the sectors with the most
exciting growth prospects.  As one of the premier companies in
that sector, Nokia is especially strong.  It continues to
announce new contracts to supply its cutting edge products to
companies throughout the world, and plans to double
production at one of it's German plants to meet demand.

We are recommending Nokia as a momentum play and also as a
split candidate.  It's last split announcement was followed be
a long, powerful rise in the stock price. Earnings will be
announced before the bell on Friday, January 29th. Although we
believe that a split announcement is likely, remember what
happened to several other stocks that either did not beat
estimates by a wide enough margin, or did not announce the
expected split.  There is opportunity to play Nokia before the
earnings are released. You could pick them up again Friday
morning if the company announces a split, and the earnings
are as strong as we expect. Holding over can be rewarding but
is always risky.

VOD - Vodafone Group PLC $187.38 (+11.38)

The vote is in, and Vodafone Group is the UK's #1 mobile
telecommunications company, serving about four million
customers. It operates analog and digital cellular networks
offering voice communications, messaging, paging, and mobile
data services. Vodafone sells its cellular phone services
through three distribution businesses: Vodafone Retail,
Vodafone Connect, and Vodafone Corporate. The company provides
cellular services in 12 countries outside the UK; international
operations account for 28% of total revenues. Vodafone will
nearly double its size with the purchase of US-based AirTouch
Communications.

VOD took a down turn with the rest of the market on Friday.  We
don't view this as anything other than profit taking.  If and when
the market resumes it's uptrend, we feel VOD will be a big winner.
Analysts have seemed to like the recent merger announcement of
VOD and ATI.  On the 19th, one analyst raised VOD from neutral
to outperform.  The combining of these two companies has very
little overlap.  This is good news for the current stock price,
because very little overlap means the quicker earnings can be
increased.  When you look at a chart of VOD, you'll notice the
choppy nature of the chart.  VOD has a lot of gaps at the open.
This is due to the nature of an ADR(American Depository Receipt).

*OI is low because the stock moves so quickly.

SEE DISCLAIMER IN SECTION ONE

It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office 
used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new 
office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out 
your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will 
probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you 
as much notice as possible.

Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet?Yes - please go ahead and forward a copy to Ed.  I don't think Mark Holsworth 
needs to be involved in this one.  Unfortunately, I don't know of anything 
directly on point other than the agreement we negotiated the last time (I

Jon,

I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX 
Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory 
issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM 
entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity?

[Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & 
Cromwell paper]

Thanks.

Subject: FX Transactions

We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
change MG's status.

Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
"arranger" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
solutions:

1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco 
Inc.
2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd 
(depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two).

The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
and Switzerland.

Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
you need any further information, please let me know.

Many thanks.

The whole schedule has yet to be determined.  I'm still waiting for final 
seating charts from the other groups so I can figure out how to most 
efficiently get people moved into their new homes.  We'll let you know as

Mark, I understand that I'm moving too.  When?  I'm going on vacation 
starting August 26th and will be out that entire next week and also will be 
out on August 18th to finish up my dental work.  I've already asked Joya to 
let me know as soon as she does regarding firm dates so I can get Carol 
packed and know where to send her things.  Please advise.  Thanks, Suz

Suzanne:
FYI.  Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?  I may be able to 
help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there.  
Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked 
or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.  If 
the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would 
prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to 
worry about it.  Let me know what you think.  Sorry to impose but I tried to 
do as much as I could before I left.

It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office 
used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new 
office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out 
your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will 
probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you 
as much notice as possible.

Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet?


My only concern is the 8 hours out of date reference.  As of when?  It might 
not be 8 hours old when they go to press so do we mean when it is being 
read?  Would it hurt to say something to the effect of "By the time you read 
this" as a lead in?  Are we sure that even this is accurate?  How long from 
press run til the first copy hits the street?

SNC - Snyder Communications, Inc. $37.75 (+2.44)

Snyder Communications, Inc. designs develops and implements
innovative and value-added outsourced marketing services.
The company's marketing programs are designed to target
high-value customer segments through database management
services, proprietary product sampling, publications,
sponsored information display in prime locations, field sales
representatives, inbound and outbound teleservices and related
services.  Snyder also provides proprietary distribution
channels, customer care and retention services.  The company
has international operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland
and Hungary.

SNC is right at previous resistance.  If it can break through
and hold above $38.00, it could have some room to really go.
SNC doesn't announce earnings until February 10th.  In the past,
SNC has announced nice earnings surprises.  The last seven
surprises have gone like this: +4%,9%,11%,6%,15%,33%,14%.
Earnings are figured to increase by 65% over the prior year
period.

Snyder Communications, Inc. announced on the 14th of January
that it has extended an earlier contract sales relationship
with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  This latest
two year pharmaceutical sales contract builds upon earlier
agreements under which Snyder Healthcare Sales, a division
of Snyder Communications, has provided targeted national sales
support for Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals since 1997.

Software - Sector
*****************
MSFT - Microsoft $156.25 (+6.50)(-0.13)(+11.19)(P6W +25.07)

From their own words, "Microsoft Rules." Although it's
current reign is being rocked with revolution, the Evil M-
pire (as some programmers and anti-Internet Explorer
browser patriots call it), has been fighting the Federal
government on anti-trust grounds for months. The line to
take their turn and bad mouth the bully was long and
distinguished. The fact is, MSFT is good at what they do.
They are the world's #1 software company (Y2K compliant or
not!) and their operating systems dominate the PC
landscape.

To those who closed their eyes and held their breath
through earnings, congratulations on a great play!  If you
sold prior to the announcement you still did very well.
MSFT gave us blowout earnings of $0.73.  The street's
whisper number was $0.64.  See, no material effect on
earnings.  Technical indicators are still positive, but a
pullback from its 1-day $13 spike after earnings should be
expected.  MSFT may drift a bit during this period of
market turmoil.  But be ready when the market firms, as
fund buyers have fresh cash to buy the big cap tech stocks.
MSFT will be their #1 target after its muscular
demonstration of earnings growth.  This post-announcement
drift won't last and presents a buying opportunity.  Rumors
are circulating that MSFT may still give us our previously
predicted split this coming week.  It comes from a
reputable source in addition to the usual suspects, but
should still be treated as a rumor.  We've also heard that
Microsoft's CFO, Greg Maffei, would rather wait to split
the stock until it reaches $200.

We will keep you apprised if it happens.  In the meantime,
the trial goes on.  MSFT's man took the stand today in the
company's defense.  To wit, Dow Jones News quotes Mr.
Maritz, "Competitors such as International Business
Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Sun Microsystems
Inc., focus primarily upon selling their operating system
products as part of relatively expensive new computer
systems, necessarily limiting their sales volume, and
thereby reducing incentives for other software developers
to create applications that run on their operating system
products.  Conversely, Microsoft provides a platform that
is compatible with a range of products, offers its product
at a low price and continually innovates.  Ironically, the
very thing that makes Windows valuable to computer
manufacturers, software publishers and customers is now
under attack in this lawsuit."  Well said.

ORCL - Oracle Corporation  $49.88 (+2.75)

Oracle is the leading developer of database management system
software, which lets multiple users and applications use the
same data at the same time.  Its flagship database software
runs on everything from notebook computers to mainframes.
Oracle8, a faster, more flexible version of the firm's database
software, provides support for a system of network computers -
stripped-down, low-cost computer terminals operated through a
control server.  Oracle also makes application development
productivity tools and computer-automated software engineering
products, among others.

ORCL gapped open on Tuesday in reaction to the IBM
announcement (see below).  After setting a new 52 week high
early on Wednesday, it traded down for the rest of Wednesday and
Thursday on what looked like profit taking.  It then bounced
nicely off of its 10 day moving average on Friday.  Since late
November, ORCL has been getting a little ahead of its 10 day
moving average, then pulling back to it, all in a nice upward
trend.  Last week this movement was a little exaggerated with
IBM announcement, but ORCL might be a good candidate for some
target shooting around its 10 dma.

In the news last week, ORCL announced that it is teaming up
with IBM to offer its software on IBM hardware.  The offering
will be targeted at manufacturers and will be available
sometime during the 1st quarter.  It will feature ORCL's
manufacturing and financial applications running on IBM's
Netfinity and RS/6000 servers.  In other news, Morgan Stanley
raised their price target for ORCL to $58 and maintained its
outperform rating.

WAG - Walgreen Co. $58.44 (+1.44)

Walgreen's is ranked #1 in the US among drugstore chains.
It has more than 2,600 freestanding stores located throughout
the US and Puerto Rico.  They even have the infamous
"drive-through" service in case you're just too sick to go
into the store! On January 13th, they announced a 71% increase
in first quarter earnings above that of last year's Q1 report.
Prescription drugs account for almost half of their sales.
Over the counter medications and general merchandise ranging
from food an beverages to toiletries make up the other half.

A little over a week ago, Walgreen Co. reported strong first
quarter earnings and a 2:1 stock split scheduled for Feb. 12th.
We waited until WAG showed signs of a steady uptrend before
adding them as one of our plays.  Walgreen's finished the week
up +$1.44 and held firm in the rocky market waters.
This could be the beginning of the split run.

No new news for Walgreen's this week.

*************
PRIA -PRI Automation, Inc. $35.88 (+1.33)(+4.87)

PRIA designs, develops, manufactures, and markets factory
automation systems for the cleanroom manufacturing operations
of semi-conductor makers and OEM equipment suppliers. Last
year's $178.2 million in revenues reflects the big downturn
in the semi-conductor industry, but that is changing. The
1998 glut of chips has been depleted, and demand is strong
again for these products.

Although it hit a high of $37.50 in Feb, 1998, PRIA stock had
lost about 75% of its value by the time the market bottomed
in October. However, it has been climbing fairly steadily
ever since, except for a brief correction in December. With
the chip industry recovering, it follows that a company in
PRIA's business will benefit. This is a momentum play in an
improving industry.

PRIA is a quiet company, with little news. Earnings are due
out Jan. 28th.

MU - Micron Technology $70.50 (-.81)(+7.68)

Micron Technology makes semi-conductor memory products, PCs,
circuit boards, memory modules, and system level assemblies,
and has a market capitalization of $17.6 billion. Revenues
for MU declined last year due to lower selling prices of PCs
and semi-conductor products. This was a result of too much
product industry wide and too little demand, but the company
is recovering now, as demand increases.

An overabundance of chips sent prices down from $200 a year
ago to below $60 in May, but they have recovered to near $90
now, as the surplus has dried up. A decreasing supply is
partly the cause. The Koreans, for instance, have been
cutting production. But the demand for chips is also
increasing because sales of PCs are on the rise. PC maker
Gateway reported strong earnings on Thursday after the bell.
Intel, the semi-conductor sector heavy-weight, showed a 12%
earnings surprise in its just-ended quarter. Micron's quarter
doesn't end until February, but it appears to be doing well.

Analyst Gregory Mishou, at Warburg Dillon Read, upped his
1999 earnings forecast to $.12 from a LOSS of $.11, and
raised his 2000 estimate to $2.31 from $1.95. He believes MU
could trade up into the mid-90s in this market. After hitting
a new high of $78.25 on Wednesday, MU pulled back with the
rest of the market. It was up slightly on Friday, however. If
the stock continues to move up on Monday, this may be an
opportunity to move into options on MU.

XLNX - Xilinx, Inc. $78.19 (+5.31)

Xilinx is one of the top makers of field-programmable gate
arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs),
integrated circuits that customers can program to perform
specific functions.  The company also provides the software
necessary for programming its chips.  Xilinx's chips are used
by electronics makers in the telecommunications, data
processing, industrial and medical instrumentation, military
and aerospace, and networking markets.  The company minimizes
its overhead by contracting out its chip manufacturing to
companies in Asia.  About a quarter of Xilinx's sales are in
Europe.  Main rival Altera has a nearly equal market share.

XLNX had an interesting week.  On the 20th, XLNX announced
record earnings along with a 2:1 stock split in March.  This
pushed the shares as high as $87.63 on the 20th.  The last two
trading days saw a little bit of profit taking.  It looks like
XLNX might fill the gap open it made on the 20th and start a new
run.  A good risk reward ratio would be a bounce off the gap on
the 20th.  This is at the $75.00 range.  XLNX might also just
turn and go up if the NASDAQ continues its record move up.
(the split is set for March 11th)

On the 20th, six different analysts upgraded XLNX.  This is a
very good sign for the future.  These analysts would have
downgraded the stock if they thought the stock was to highly
valued already.  XLNX noted in their earnings report that
revenue from telecommunications companies increased substantially.
This is a good sign.  The telecoms are a fast growing industry
and this should help XLNX's future earnings.

********************************
LXK - Lexmark Intl $99.25 (+1.19)(-2.50)(+.06)(+7.25)(+1.31)

Lexmark has good peripheral vision. Lexmark International
Group is a leading maker of computer printers and related
products, which generate more than 80% of its sales. Its
printer line includes laser printers (designed primarily
for corporate networks and desktops) and ink-jet printers
(for home and business use). Unlike many of its competitors,
Lexmark develops and manufactures it's own printers, which
results in fast product cycle times. The company also makes 
supplies for IBM and other name brand printers and typewriters.
Lexmark's products are sold in more than 15,000 retail outlets
in more than 150 countries.

LXK held up pretty decent this week, considering the market.
LXK has it's earnings announcement before market on Monday (25th).
This has been confirmed with investor relations.  LXK is sitting
right on its 20-dma for the 2nd week in a row.  For those looking
to get in on the split, wait for a pullback after the gap
open.  If LXK disappoints, we feel its time will come to an end.
This earnings season has been disastrous for many companies that
seemed to have announced good earnings.

LXK news has been non existent for the last week.  In general,
the technology sector has held up.  LXK has held up slightly
better than its industry.  It all depends on the announcement
Monday.

EMC - EMC Corporation $98.50 (-1.56)(+6.50)(+8.56)(+3.38)

EMC is a Fortune 500 company that designs, manufactures,
markets an supports high performance storage products.  The
company's products store retrieve, manage, protect and share
information from all major computing environments, including
UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe platforms.  EMC markets its
memory products under the name Symmetrix.  EMC and its
enterprise storage systems have developed a clear cut
technological edge over its competition.  The company has been
able to successfully leverage its leadership position in the
mainframe storage area into the lucrative, faster growing open
systems market.

In the news last week, Staples, the world's largest operator of
office superstores, announced that they have standardized their
data storage needs on an EMC system.  The reasons they gave
were to more effectively manage rapid business growth, reduce
information management costs, and improve customer service.
Also, there was an interesting article at MSN MoneyCentral
comparing EMC and its rival NTAP.  An observation by the
article was that every bit of new e-mail, every sale over the
Internet, and every extra page view increases the need to build
more storage into the Internet.  It also pointed out that EMC
has just begun selling software to its customer base.  Software
sales are expected to grow from $400 million in 1998 to $1
billion by 2001.

Last week was EMC's first losing week in the last 5 weeks.
Then again, the techs were under some heavy selling pressure
last week.  EMC set a new 52 week high on Wednesday, and then
traded down.  There was a scary gap down at the open on Friday,
but EMC recovered nicely.  EMC reports earnings before the
open on 1/26, and as we indicated last week, we don't believe
there will be a split announcement with earnings.  After
further research, EMC does not have enough shares authorized
and their next shareholders meeting is not expected until
April.  Also, please note that the option root on some EMC
options has changed.

XIRC - Xircom Inc. $42.00 (+2.12)(+1.38)(+4.50)(+1.25)

Xircom makes adapters that connect portable PCs to corporate
networks, the Internet, and commercial online services. The
company's products include adapter/modem cards (CreditCard
Ethernet+Modem), network adapters for portable PCs (Pocket
Ethernet Adapter, Pocket Token Ring Adapter), and modem-only
PC cards (CreditCard Modem). Xircom sells its products to
original equipment manufacturers and through a worldwide
network of distributors, value-added resellers, and computer
retailers. Over half of its income is from foreign sales.
Intel owns 11% of Xircom; chairman and CEO Dirk Gates owns
about 5%.

XIRC announced earnings on the 19th of January that were $.05
above consensus estimates and a penny ahead of the whisper.
On the 20th, XIRC traded as high as $44.50.  We feel when the
market resumes its bullish stance, XIRC will be a strong
mover.  XIRC bounced off its 10-dma Friday for the 3rd time in
5 days.  A close right on the high of the day on Friday also
shows some internal strength.

No recent news on XIRC.  Here are some of the actual figures
announced with XIRC earnings.  Net sales increased 83% over
the prior year period.  Net income increase 354%, to $.39
from $.11.  The RealPort family of Integrated PC Cards now
accounts for about 40% of revenues.  Pretty impressive.

SUNW - Sun Microsystems $98.00 (-2.44)(+9.56)(+5.25)(+2.32)

UltraSPARCs, Netra servers, SPARCstations, and Solaris (for
Unix) are all products of Sun Microsystems.  Sun is also the
creator of the Java computer language.  They are also the
recent partners with AOL in the Netscape merger.

This past Wednesday, SUN traded as high as $115.75.  But
severe profit taking and differing opinions drove the stock
to as low as $96.44 before their earnings announcement on
Thursday.  Even after announcing positive earnings, a 22%
increase in revenues, and a 2:1 stock split, SUNW's stock
wasn't able to recover.  Sun had actually attempted to shrug
off all of the profit takers and reached $100.25 in intraday
trading on Friday.  But, it then lost those gains and closed
down -$0.25.  Maybe the unstable market contributed to the
drop.  Maybe it had to do with BancBoston Robertson Stephens
downgrading the stock stating a drop-off in bookings, backlogs,
more competition, and revenue reports that weren't up to par
with their expectations.  However, S&P rated them an
accumulate and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rated them a strong
buy.  They were happy with the "sharp rise" in earnings which
were in line with their expectations and the positive future
outlook of the company.  In any case, we would like to see the
market and Sun Microsystems turn around before initiating any
new plays on the split news.  Friday's lack of any serious
profit-taking on top of Thursday's action and earnings
report is an encouraging sign.

Other News:   SUN will officially unveil their Jini technology
on Monday.  Excitement is building over the possibilities of
networking electronic devices by using the new language.
Eight companies, including Sony and Sharp, will collaborate
with SUN to develop the ability for HAVi compliant devices to
use the new Jini.

I spoke with Stacey Carey today after the ISDA call.  I reiterated that we 
have been willing to support the process so far on the understanding that we 
would prefer a bill that gives us parity with financial products and, failing 
that, the minimum we can accept is a bill which exempts (preferably excludes) 
energy commodities and hopefully metals from the Act.   She confirmed that 
ISDA will continue to push for the exemption or exclusion.

The comments from Treasury to Chris Long recently underscore that our "Phil 
Graham card", to the extent we have one, is a significant political strength 
for us and we should not play the card until we need to.  Stacey agreed with 
a statement made by Don Moorehead on this morning's call that Graham will not 
start to move in the process until the House has produced a viable bill.  
Given that we should probably not seek his help until a bit later in the 
process - possibly mid September.

Do you think that a bill favorable to energy will be passed over the strong

significant change if Treasury is not longer against us -- but it is a little 
hard for me to believe that it is real.  Should I try to make a trip to

Hi Brent, I have been in contact with Dale Neuner regarding the creation of 
the Product Types for Argentina, by now he has all the necessary information. 
We will need your approval on the wording that was suggested for the long 
description and other legal sign-off. I have already gone through the product 
descriptions with Andrea and no mayor comments came up. Regarding Natural Gas 
products, her comments were that we are creating a Firm product with TOP 
100%, but that is OK. Then on the additional information like delivery 
points, term, currency and unit of measure, all those alternatives have been 
given to Dale for him to load into the system.
Please give me an update on your timetable for these issues.
Regards

PatrickThanks for your note and glad to hear you're feeling better.  Yes we are all 
very sad about Jim's baby.  Many years ago my sister had a child who was born 
two or three months early and lived for several days - long enough to be held 
and loved - but his lungs were apparently just not developed enough and they 
couldn't save him.   I know how painful that was for them.   And I have to 
admit that experience made me very anxious when things didn't go perfectly 
for you guys that first few days. 

I received papers from Julia regarding your options a week or so ago which I 
didn't send along because the next day Julia said HR had made a mistake in 
everybody's package and HR was sending replacement documents - I haven't 
received the replacements yet but will ask.

Stephanie has started and seems to be fitting in as far as I can tell at this 
stage.  We're all super busy but more or less keeping up with the critical 
stuff.  We'll look forward to seeing you soon.(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, any master agreement o=

Received a call this morning from Tim Reyes with Alcoa.  He is wanting to 
find out if his master contract will come into play when utilizing 
EnronOnline.  He is also wanting to add products to his master if they are 
not currently included.  He was hoping to talk with someone today.

I know that master contracts are utilized by EnronOnline but customer wanted 
to know what products his master covered.  He also mentioned that he did not 
have a copy of the master contract between Enron and Alcoa.

DELL - Dell Computer $83.00 (+4.00)(+1.19)(+4.62)(P3W+6.00)

Dell is the largest direct sales PC manufacturer in the
world, listed at 125th in the Fortune-500 and 343rd in the
Global-500 of top companies, with $16.8 billion in sales
over the last 4 quarters. Dell has consistently
outperformed any other major stock for price performance.
Dell is up +1200% in the last five years and has split
their stock five times in the last three years, two times
in 1998 alone.  Dell is a low price, high margin producer
because it has only 6 days of inventory and doesn't have to
pay its suppliers (some who manufacture in Asia) until 8
days later. Since Dell gets paid before it manufactures a
box, they have a huge cash float-can you say "83% return on
equity?"  In late December, they announced a multi-year
marketing deal with AOL to place AOL on all Dell desktops.
In its server business, Dell managed a 62% year over year
sequential revenue growth.  With over 200 product and
service awards earned during 1998, Dell has not forgotten
its manufacturing and marketing prowess

Veteran readers may recall our obituary to DELL written in
October.  For those who missed it, "It is not often we have
to write an obituary for a great play but for those of us
still in denial, Dell may be dead.  We still think Dell is
a great company.  Great earnings, great sales, growing at
+50%, opening new markets.  We think the problems are
many."  We assumed that the shares in float, now totaling
about 980 million (that's "m", not "b"), had split so many
times, so as to dilute the stock's ability to have big
daily run-ups or even bigger earnings per share surprises.
We reasoned it now takes an additional $10 million of
earnings to create $.01 per share surprise.  Dell used to
surprise us by $.05 routinely-pretty hard now to hide $50
million quarterly from Wall Street, especially for an
earnings surprise.  In essence, Dell's ratio of daily
turnover compared to shares in float couldn't move the
price as much.  To add insult to injury, Dell really
flattened out after its last split run to $69, where it
fell back to languish in the $60-$66 range.  In early
November, DELL spiked up  to $72 in anticipation of another
earnings surprise but couldn't hold it after the
announcement.  So we dropped it despite its sound
fundamentals.  Now, Dell's back.

From their 10Q filed with the SEC December 14th, we glean
the following: During the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal 1999, enterprise unit sales increased 112%
and 165%, respectively, compared to the third quarter and
first nine months of fiscal 1998, and increased
sequentially 13% over the second quarter of fiscal 1999.
Notebook unit sales increased 141% and 123% in the third
quarter and first nine months of fiscal 1999, compared to
the same period of the prior fiscal year, and increased
sequentially 16% over the second quarter of fiscal 1999.
Net revenue increased in all geographic regions in the
third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 1999 as
compared to the same periods of fiscal 1998. Net revenue
for the third quarter of fiscal 1999 compared to the third
quarter of fiscal 1998 increased 46% in the Americas, 68%
in Europe and 49% in Asia-Pacific and Japan. Net revenue
for the first nine months of fiscal 1999 compared to the
first nine months of fiscal 1998 increased 48% in the
Americas,67% in Europe and 39% in Asia-Pacific and Japan.

Nowadays, this stuff barely makes the news.  We think their
price would be higher if it did.

Wednesday, Dell's volume swelled to over 27 million shares,
well above its 19 million share average, raising the price
$2.19 to an all-time closing high of $85.31.  If Dell can
break this, its next resistance is $88.13, set in Wednesday
intra-day trading.  Thursday and Friday, Dell fared much
better than the overall NASDAQ giving back only $2.31 on
lower than average volumes.  This shows investor
unwillingness to part with the stock, though we could sure
use more high volume trading days.  As evidenced by Dell's
tie for the #1 position in PCs and workstations, we can
only offer an educated guess that Dell contributed
significantly to Microsoft's stellar earnings.  What's good
for the goose is good for the gander, and we expect this to
be well-reflected in Dell's earnings too.  Heck, Gateway
impressed the market with upside surprise earnings. So will
Dell as news of Dell's success's get more notice running
into earnings, scheduled Tues., February 16, after the
close.

It is not likely you'll hear this from the Wall Street
Journal, Baron's or CNBC.  So we'll spread the word.  While
Hewlett Packard still rules the NT space, price deflation
is favoring direct seller Dell, which claimed 20% of the NT
market in the September period, nearly double its previous
share (motley Fool).  Hewlett-Packard and Dell, which had
zero market share in the beginning of 1997, are in a
virtual tie for first place in both units and revenue for
the personal workstation segment (Reuters).  That knocked
Compaq out of the number two slot, as its market share
plunged from 34% to 17% (Motley Fool). Dell will integrate
@Home's broadband Internet service experience with cable-
ready and Dell Dimension desktop PCs (PRNewswire).  Dell
will be the first major computer vendor to offer the
multiple award-winning Digital Flat Panel Solution Pack
from Number Nine Visual Technology. Thursday, they
announced ImageWatch(SM), a program that provides early
notification of technology changes to Dell corporate and
institutional customers, available at no charge.

Dip buying is warranted, but confirm upward market movement first.

Biotech  - Sector
*****************
AMGN - Amgen $114.63 (+5.75)

Founded in 1980, Amgen is a global biotechnology company that
develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics based
on advances in cellular and molecular biology.  With sales of
$2.34 billion, it is the largest of the biotech companies and
is more than twice the size of its nearest rival.  Amgen's
products include the billion-dollar blockbusters Epogen (EPO)
and Neupogen, as well as Infergen.  Epogen is used to treat
anemia in patients with kidney failure or patients undergoing
chemotherapy.  Neupogen is used to stimulate the immune system
and Infergen treats chronic hepatitis.  Many other drugs are
in the pipeline, but the most important new drug is NESP--a
next-generation drug to succeed EPO.

On December 22, 1998, Amgen won a critical court ruling over
Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), which gave AMGN exclusive rights
to NESP.  As a young, struggling company, Amgen had sold the
rights to Epogen (EPO) to JNJ, and JNJ claimed NESP, the new
successor to EPO, was just a revised version of the same
drug, and was covered under the EPO sales agreement.  EPO is
one of the top selling drugs in the world.  It's three makers,
JNJ, Roche, and Amgen sold over $3 billion of the drug last
year.  EPO must be injected three times a week and is done in
a hospital setting.  NESP is injected only once per week and
may eventually be used by the patient at home. It will almost
certainly replace EPO when the final phase of ongoing human
testing is completed, and it could give Amgen $1 billion in
annual sales.  Amgen is also working on Major new drugs for
weight loss and Parkinson's, but they are 4-5 years away. EPO
shows skeptics that Amgen really does have important drugs
in the pipeline.

*AMGN announces earnings on Jan. 27th (according to Zack's).
They last split 2:1 in 1995 near $100.  They have 750 mln
shares authorized and only 254 mln outstanding.  A split
is a definite possibility.

Amgen set an intra-day high Wednesday of $115.44, it's only
resistance. Even when the rest of the market was diving
Thursday and Friday, AMGN  was looking strong.  This stock
has been considered a possible take-over target at times in
the past, but has wanted to remain independent.  Now Amgen
has the ability to do the acquiring, if it desires.

VIA.B - Viacom Inc. $82.56 (+3.25)

Viacom Inc. is an entertainment company centered around
"fun stuff."  It owns networks like MTV, VH-1, Nickelodeon,
Nick at Nite, and Showtime.  It dabbles in Comedy Central,
United Paramount Network, and the All News Channel.  It has
stakes in book publishers, Blockbuster Video, Paramount
Pictures, movie theaters, and music/theme parks.  It even
syndicates it's popular TV show creations like the "Melrose
Place" and "Beverly Hills 90210."

Strictly a momentum play, Viacom has been in a great
long term uptrend from it's October lows.  It has graciously
provided several dips along the way for patient investors.
We would suggest the same.  However, it's latest run
is looking very strong (not a hint of trouble with last
week's market worries).  Maybe investors are jumping
in now for an early start on any earnings run (due out
in about a month).  Surprisingly, A.G. Edwards' multiple
downgrades on this stock has had no effect.  Why they
have it out for this company we don't know.  Fortunately
VIAB (or VIA.B) has been able to shrug them off without
penalty.

No earth shattering news for Viacom this past week.

UTX - United Technologies Corp. $114.56 (+4.88)(-5.00)(+5.94)

UTX makes a variety of products, from elevators to air
conditioners. Its subsidiary Carrier is the world's largest
maker of heating and air-conditioning systems.  It manufactures
and services heating, ventilating, and refrigeration equipment.
UTX's Otis is the world's #1 elevator manufacturer; it also
makes and services escalators, moving sidewalks, and shuttle
systems.  Its subsidiary Hamilton Standard produces engine
controls, environmental systems, propellers, and other flight
systems. Another subsidiary Pratt & Whitney makes engines for
both commercial and military aircraft.  The company's Sikorsky
unit makes helicopters

In the news last week, UTX reported earnings of $1.16 per share
which beat the estimates of $1.11 per share.  This represented
an 18% increase above the same quarter a year ago.  Strong
showings in its aircraft and refrigeration businesses were
factors in the increase.  What probably helped the stock more
than the earnings announcement was UTX saying that it has hired
Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives for its
automotive components business.  The automotive components
business is consolidating, operating profits are falling and
revenues are flat.  The Street liked that announcement.

UTX set a new 52 week high on Thursday, and then traded off in
some profit taking.  After the close on Friday, UTX was
downgraded from a buy to a hold by CIBC Oppenheimer.  We don't
know how this will affect UTX on Monday, but we would wait and
see before initiating any new trades.  Also, you need to
remember when trading UTX that it is a Dow 30 component and is
very Dow sensitive.  UTX has two things going for it next week.
One, UTX did not trade down after its earnings announcement
like a lot of stocks have recently.  Two, the Street likes the
fact that it is attempting to sell its underperforming
automotive unit.

DH - Dayton Hudson $59.94 (+3.00)(P3W +4.87)

Dayton Hudson is the parent company of Target Stores, which
accounts for approximately 75% of the company's sales.
Target is the #3 large-format, discount department store
behind K-Mart and Wal-Mart, #2 and #1, respectively, and
the focus of Dayton Hudson's expansion.  Target (pronounced
"Tar-zhay" in some circles) differentiates itself by
offering more upscale merchandise than either K-Mart or
Wal-Mart, but with prices similar to the K-Mart/Wal-mart
genre.  Dayton Hudson also operates Mervyn's California and
Marshall Field's.  All told, Dayton Hudson operates over
1100 stores under the 3 formats, generating almost $28
billion in 1998 sales.

Dayton Hudson's chart reminds us a bit of Maytag with a few
more gyrations.  The chart, with the exception of the mid-
December negative spike and recovery, shows a great
trajectory.  Technicals including MACD, momentum,
stochastics and RSI are all in positive territory.  Last
week, DH showed lots of strength by rising $3 to $59.94, a
new closing high in the overall market downdraft.  That it
held at this level on heavy volume shows strong buying
activity and new support.  Its only resistance is $61.50
reached in inter-day trading.  DH is not a fast mover, but
is a steady performer and a safer play for the less risk
inclined among us.  1189 institutions own 89.5% of the 395
million shares in float leaving about 40 million shares in
daily float; very little percentage-wise for the small
investor.  Earlier in the month, DH announced plans to buy 
back $1 billion of its stock, or about 16.8 million shares
at its current price; should make great action when the
volume picks up.  In Thursday trading, a block of 500,800
shares crossed at $58.75-more support.  Market permitting,
this could be a nice long ride.

Of note, Target "unveiled an exclusive collection of
products for the home designed by highly acclaimed
architect Michael Graves.  Products include clocks,
utensils, small appliances, picture frames, lawn and garden
furniture and much more," according to a PRNewswire
release.  On July 25, Target also plans to open 24 new
stores including its first stores in New England, which
will bring its total to 884 stores.  15 others will open on
March 7.  Total store openings for 1999 should exceed 70.
December 1998 sales increased 11.7% over the previous year,
with 6.5% same store gains over the same period.  We like
this kind of new as it makes the future look pretty good

PUTS, PUTS, PUTS

Put plays can be very profitable but have a larger risk than
call plays. When a stock is falling the entire investment
community (except the shorts) is hoping it will reverse and
start back up. The company management is also doing everything
they can to shore up their stock price. The company issues
press releases, brokers talk it up, analysts try to put a
positive spin on everything. Then of course there is the death
knell, the "buy recommendation" simply because the price has
dropped to some level that analysts feel attractive again.
Buyers who like the stock wait until it appears a bottom has
been reached and then jump on it in a feeding frenzy. They may
already have a large position and are averaging down. Many
factors can stop a free falling stock in mid drop.

Technology

Company Description:
Avnet, Inc. is a distributor of electronic components and

10/2/98, sales rose 13% to $1.58 billion.  Net income fell
63% to $15.7 million.

Play Description:
Downward trending gross profit margin is due primarily to the
competitive environment in the electronics distribution
marketplace as a result of the global industry correction
cycle as well as the increased sales of computer products,
including microprocessors, which have lower gross margins
than other products in the Avnet's product line.  Avnet needs
to overcome new organizational structure to better focus on
its core businesses to better serve the needs of customers
and suppliers.  Recent news of a "significant" slump in
December sales of core products in its electronics and
computer marketing groups will result in fiscal Q2 EPS of
about $0.75, missing the First Call mean estimate of $0.91.
Stock failed on recent rally at key price point of $60 with
downside gap large enough to drive a truck through.  Stock now
under short and long-term moving averages.  Lots of overhead.

large state within the country last week decided to halt
payments on its debt to the central government.  Some of this
concern carried over to U.S. markets, knocking financial
stocks off highs hit earlier in 1999.  The Bovespa has been
weak, and concerns about Brazil will cool the financial

Earnings were offset by a $90.9M charge forrestructuring and
the write-down of impaired assets.

two brokerages concerned about the medical equipment
company's growth rate downgraded the stock. The maker of
medical supplies, devices and diagnostic systems (BDX) saw
shares fall 3 1/16 to 33 3/4 after analyst Ann Barber of Credit
Suisse First Boston cited disappointing first-quarter sales.
Becton Dickinson said Thursday sales rose 10 percent,
shy of Barber's 13 percent projection. Barber, who cut her
rating on the stock to "hold" from "buy," also pointed to a
weakening trend in the company's diabetes business.  Scott
Wilkin at Warburg Dillon Read, also downgrading BDX to "hold"
from "buy" cited "sluggish" sales growth in the first
quarter. Wilkin said Becton Dickinson's earnings of 29 cents
a share was "in line" with his estimate, but "was aided by a
lower corporate tax rate and an unexpected gain in other
income."


Wilkin cut his 1999 earnings estimate for the company to $1.56
a share from $1.57 and his 2000 estimate to $1.75 from
$1.81.Stock

		 Subject: Re: EnronOnline

Mark: 

Implementation of the EOL project in Brazil had been postponed for a while 
because of regulatory matters. The Market Rules were still being discussed 
and had not been approved by ANEEL, making it impossible for us to implement 
EOL, from a regulatory standpoint. Recently (about a couple of weeks ago), 
ANEEL issued Resolution 290/00, approving the Market Rules, subject to 
certain amendments. The amendments will be implemented in stages over the 
course of the next few years. After Resolution 290 was issued and the 
regulatory issues were partially resolved, the EOL team decided to work on 
the project again. I am now in the course of adapting the ETA, GTC and 
Password Application for use in Brazil. I will probably have drafts for 
comments within the next 10 days. I am not sure about the time estimate for 
completion of the project as a whole. I believe Remi can give you a better 
idea of the schedule.

I will forward to you in a separate e-mail the legal opinion that we received 
from outside counsel, addressing the issues in the memo prepared by your 
team. Also, I take the opportunity to let you know that I am leaving Enron by 
the end of August. From September on, the contact people for the EOL project 
will be Remi and Ricardo on the commercial side, and Sami Arap on the legal. 
In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I can be of any further 
assistance.

Campbell Soup Company (CPB) - $44.31 .25 (-.81)

Campbell Soup Company is a global manufacturer and marketer of
branded convenience food products operating in three business
segments: Soup and Sauces, Biscuits and Confectionery, and
Foodservice. Campbell Soup Company is the world's largest
maker and marketer of soup with fiscal 1998 sales of $6.7
billion.

Warm weather, flat sales, inefficient supply chain, and
company's ability to achieve costs savings and capacity
utilization are being called into question by analysts.
Increased marketing and selling expenses, increased store
level inventory levels, encroachment from private label (store
brand) products, reduced consumption levels and a recent
announce of new cost-cutting initiatives will cause fiscal
1999 earnings to fall short of analysts' estimates by 18 to
23 cents per share.  Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.,
which tracks such estimates, had expected the company to earn
$2.13 a share during the year, which ends July 31. Campbell
earned $1.90 a share in the prior year. Campbell Soup Co.
said it now expects U.S. soup consumption to rise by only 1
to 2 percent in the second quarter from the previous year,
not 4 to 5 percent.

Stock recently failed at $59 and then broke key support at
$54.00 on news of earnings shortfall. Excessive call buying
recently is bearish and may provide continued overhead
resistance.

Play: Earnings Warnings

Update:
Stock recovered some last week but still trading below gap
price of $45.  Could sell off more if broad market comes
under pressure.

industry segments: Chemicals, Fibers, Polymers,Life
Sciences, and Diversified Businesses.  For the 9 monthsended
9/30/98, total revenues rose 1% to $19.29B.  Netincome from
continuing operations before extraordinary itemand
applicable to Common fell 37% to $859M.  Revenuesbenefited
from acquisitions. Earnings were offset by a$651M
increase in purchased in-process R&D charges.

Pricing pressures from overcapacity continue to weigh on the
chemical group.  Street has been busy cutting the group's
earnings estimates for the next couple of quarters, as
troubled economies in Asia and Latin America suggest that
demand/pricing conditions won't improve any time soon.
Commodity chemicals such as ethylene hardest hit, with prices
falling by as much as 50% over past year.  Stocks have seen
some buying interest in recent weeks on hopes that lower
interest rates will jumpstart sagging global economy.  But
gains appear more a function of underlying market strength and
light bargain hunting than any sea change in expectations for
a sustained earnings recovery.  Chemical companies are
cutting jobs and reducing production to adjust to challenging
conditions.  Comparison periods will also become more
attractive by mid-CY99. However, until that time there is no
reason to suspect the group to do anything but underperform
the market.  Given existing oversupply, declining earnings
growth, slowing worldwide economic growth and the market's
preference for momentum over turnaround situations, DD could
be under pressure over the near-term.  After advancing $7
over the past couple of weeks, DuPont signaled a failed rally
at its declining 200-day moving average.  Target - $53.

Play: Failed Rally

Stock moved up fractionally during Friday's (1/22) broad sell
off. Stock still below declining moving averages.  Tighten
protective sell stop to $58.25.

Hershey Foods (HSY) - $59.00 1.00 (-2.25)

ershey Foods (HSY) manufactures, distributes, and sells a
broad line of chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery,
pasta and grocery products.  For the nine months ended
10/4/98, net sales rose 4% to $3.2 billion.  Net income rose
5% to $230.9 million.  Revenues reflect higher sales of core
confectionery brands and incremental sales from the
introduction of new confectionery products.  Earnings also
reflect reduced marketing costs for existing brands and lower
selling costs in foreign markets.

Play Description:
Stock continues to struggle following analyst downgrades and
Q4 weakness. Margins are likely to be under pressure with
increased costs. Stock simply seems to be out of favor and
relative strength is declining. Likely to test lows at $48.

Play: Failed Rally

to eliminate the company's older, less-efficient manufacturing
capacity and to manage inventory levels. Analysts recently cut

Perkin-Elmer Corporation (PKN) - $91.31  -2.88 (-4.06)

Perkin-Elmer Corporation (PKN) develops, manufactures and
markets life science systems and analytical instruments for
the pharmaceutical, biotech, environmental, agricultural,
forensics and chemical industries. For the three months ended
9/98, revenues rose 16% to $375.8 billion. Net income fell
21% to $17 million. Revenues reflect higher sales of biotech
products in the U.S. and Europe. Earnings suffered from
higher R&D, merger charges, decreased interest income, a $3.1
million loss at Tecan and a higher tax rate.

PKN operates internationally, with manufacturing and
distribution facilities in various countries throughout the
world and derives approximately 53% of its revenues from
countries outside of the United States. Results continue to
be affected by market risk, including fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates and changes in economic conditions in
foreign markets. Company is in the process of reorganizing
the Company's capital structure to help move Perkin-Elmer
toward a market leader in biomedical and genomics
information. They are currently evaluating strategic
alternatives for our analytical instruments business.

Distribution among top institutional shareholders is taking
place as stock is likely to trade back into trading range of

Warner Lambert (WLA) - $67.94 .94 (-1.88)

Warner Lambert is a manufacturer of ethical pharmaceuticals,
biologicals, capsules, consumer health care products and
confectionary products.

Shares of large U.S. drug companies are being hurt by profit
taking and concerns about proposed changes to the Medicare
payment system.  Recently, a Bipartisan Commission opened the
door for Medicare to cover prescription drugs for
beneficiaries, a recommendation that if adopted, could put
pressure on drug companies.  Recent inquiries regarding the
safety of Rezulin received nationally televised attention and
may give rise to  investor concern.   Also, it may be
difficult to sustain the growth rates for Lipitor, Rezulin
and Neurontin products that WLA has enjoyed this past year.

Top side consolidation since July may be difficult to overcome
in extended market conditions.  Given that the drug sector
has and will continue to be a strong performing sector, we
recommend a modest sell-off price targets of $55 to 60.

Play: Failed Rally

Update:
Top side consolidation since July may be difficult to overcome
in extended market conditions.  Still trading below key 100

COMBO PLAYS
***********
U.S. blue chips stocks fell sharply Friday as worries about the
Brazilian currency crisis and poor revenues at the world's biggest
computer maker drove traders to an aggressive sell-off. The DJIA
closed 143 points lower and has shed all of its gains for the year.
Concerns that Latin America's economic instability and Brazil's
currency devaluation could hurt other countries sent investors out
of stocks and into bonds, seeking safety in U.S. government assets.
To make matters worse, IBM's earnings were good, not spectacular,
and revenues were disappointing due to poor hardware sales. IBM
also failed to announce a generally expected stock split, making
investors even more unhappy. Analysts are saying the main problem
with our current market is that optimistic investors are expecting
earnings to come in better than what they're actually going to be
and this will probably cause a near-term market downturn. We shall
soon find out!

Our new spread positions were all available near the recommended
entry points. CTXS was the first candidate, and although the stock
price continued to slide, the play (MAR90C/FEB95C) was still
favorable at an initial debit of $4.87. RDRT was also lower at the
open and the debit for the MAR17C/FEB20C bullish diagonal spread
was $1.75. LVLT was a bull-call position with a conservative bias
and the price for the MAR37C/MAR45C spread was $4.62. SEPR is our
new long-term play and the volatile trading offered a couple of
opportunities to enter the position, (JAN00-100/FEB100C) at $19.25.

Other activities included a closing play on CIEN as the stock price
gapped-up $4 amid speculation it may again be a possible takeover
target and rumors it may land a large contract. PCS continues to
move higher in the "hot" telecom sector and we are monitoring the
positions closely. They are now both deeply ITM and there is always
the chance of early exercise. Good Luck!

The calendar (or time spread) is profitable if the value of the
position exceeds the initial debit (or cost-basis) at the end of
the expiration period for the long position. However, because we
track the plays based on the current closing cost/value, the gains
for time spreads will rarely be reflected until the play closes.
Each month, as we sell a new call against the long position, the
net cost should decline or the position value should increase.

NEW PLAYS
*********
MRK - Merck Company Inc.  $139.00     *** Earnings Slam ***

Merck is the #1 drugmaker in the US and is tied for first in the
world with Glaxo Wellcome in prescription drugs. They develop
products for both humans and animals; almost two-fifths of its
sales come from treating ailments associated with American eating
habits, (high cholesterol, hypertension, and heart failure). In
addition, Merck has the top-selling US drugs for hypertension
as well as newer, promising drugs for AIDS treatment, male balding
and migraine headaches. Also under development is a new arthritis
drug.

The drug developer fell $7.31 on Friday after it said it will stop
testing its MK-869 drug for use as an antidepressant. The company
hoped to develop the drug, which it will still test as a treatment
for nausea in cancer patients, as a hedge against the impending
loss of 4 major patents in 2001. The split run (2/16/98, 2-1) may
have some effect but the SOR date is Monday (after the close) and
we see this one falling short of the sold strike in mid-February.

EMC - EMC Corp.  $98.50     *** Technical/Disparity Play ***

EMC Corp. and its subsidiaries design, manufacture, market and
support a wide range of storage-related hardware, software and
service products for the open systems, mainframe and network
attached information storage and retrieval system market. The
company is the #1 maker of many of these components. EMC markets
its memory products under the name Symmetrix. Other products let
users manage remote data and share information across networks of
different computers. EMC continues to broaden its product line,
strengthen alliances, and expand its global presence to create
more platform-independent systems.

We just like the chart and the small disparity for a (relatively)
free-money play.

SKYT - Skytel  $26.38     *** Telecom ***

SkyTel Communications (formerly Mobile Telecom Tech.) is one of
the leading providers of worldwide wireless messaging services,
marketing primarily to business users. The company offers a wide
range of messaging services to its users. Subsidiary SkyTel Corp.
provides paging and messaging services including pagers, two-way
alphanumeric text messaging and two-way interactive messaging.
SkyTel also provides messaging services in in Central and South
America through its Mtel Latin America subsidiary. SKYT recently
added more specialized content to its information services with
the addition of Asian market updates, real-time stock quotes,
sports scores, company news, ski reports and horoscopes. Coverage
was initiated early this month by ABN AMRO with an "Outperform"
rating and we like the long-term outlook for the chart.

SELL CALL FEB-25.00 MMQ-BE OI=3012 B=$2.38
NET DEBIT TARGET=$1.87 ROI(max)=33%

Note: In the long-term calendar spread, we are reducing the net
cost of the long option by the amount of credit from the sale of
the nearer-term option. If the near-term call expires worthless,
we will sell the MAR call to further reduce our debit. If your
short-term position is ITM on the last day of the strike, you
need to buy it back so that you DON'T have to exercise the long
term position. In that case, your long position is going up in
value also and on the last day of the strike period, the short
call will shrink down to intrinsic value so you should be ahead
in the play even after you buy it back.

PLCM - Polycom  $26.75     *** Telecom ***

Polycom makes long-distance teleconferencing products for use on

system enables people in different locations to view and edit
documents on a simultaneous, interactive basis. Its SoundStation
audio-conferencing system, provides two-way voice communication
without typical speakerphone distortion. Subsidiary ViaVideo
Communications offers ViewStation, a Web-based videoconferencing
system that features a voice-tracking camera. Reported awesome
earnings last week, net revenues grew 140% for the year to over
$100 million. Technically, an outstanding chart with some recent
support around $21 but it may need to consolidate before moving
higher. That will be just the thing we need to benefit from this
time spread.

NRC - NAC RE Corp  $48.56     *** Technical Time Spread ***

NAC Re is a holding company whose subsidiaries offer property and
casualty reinsurance. Subsidiaries NAC Reinsurance, Greenwich
Insurance Company, Indian Harbor Company, and NAC Re International
Holdings provide both treaty reinsurance for categories of risk
and facultative individual risk reinsurance to primary insurers of
casualty risk. Most U.S. commercial property-casualty insurers,
battered by an unrelenting price war and increases in catastrophe
losses, were expected to post flat to lower earnings in the fourth
quarter. This may also be the case for NRC but we think the stock
price will hold near the current range for the next few weeks.
Technically, NRC is making feeble attempts to break-out of it's
stage III top but with little volume support. Its 150 dma is the
current resistance (around $49) with support around $45. It will
take some work to exit the current sideways trend and that's just
what we need to make this play profitable.

PLAY (conservative):

BUY  CALL MAR-50 NRC-CJ OI=160 A=$4.87

NET DEBIT TARGET=$1.00 TARGET ROI=50%

CNTO - Centocor  $39.93     *** Butterfly Spread ***

Centocor makes therapeutic, diagnostic drugs for cardiovascular
problems, cancer and other diseases. Three of their products are
approved for sale in the US: ReoPro prevents blood clots during
angioplasty, Remicade treats the bowel disorder Crohn's disease
(and is being tested for efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis),
and Panorex treats cancer. ReoPro is sold in the US and Europe by
Eli Lilly. Centocor's drug Avakine is in the final US testing
stages for treatment of Crohn's disease. The company owns the US
and Canadian marketing rights for Retavase, a cardiovascular drug
developed by Roche Holding. Centocor is also selling its oncology
diagnostics business to focus on therapeutics.

Recently, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its rating on the firm
to "outperform" from "strong buy" and adjusted its 12-month price
target to $51 per share from $62 per share. We think that's a bit
optimistic as CNTO has been trading around $35 to $45 for almost
two years and has a very long term base with no immediate signs of
a significant character or trend change. The volatility of the
holiday bull-run seems to have dissipated and the sideways trend
is now resuming. We are going to start this play as a "butterfly"
but plan to roll-out of each spread as the stock price moves about
the $40 range.

PLAY (conservative/long-term):

BUY  CALL  APRIL-35 COQ-DG OI=364  A=$7.50
SELL CALLS APRIL-40 COQ-DH OI=507  B=$4.38
BUY  CALL  APRIL-45 COQ-DI OI=1227 A=$2.68
NET DEBIT TARGET=$1.00 TARGET ROI=50%

The butterfly spread is generally a neutral position that is
a combination of both a BULL spread and a BEAR spread. This
spread is designed primarily for the stock that will not
experience much of a net rise or decline by expiration. It
generally requires only a small investment and has a limited
risk but profits are limited as well. It can also be costly
in terms of commissions so you should consider playing these
combination strategies with a low cost (discount) broker.

There are three strike prices involved in a butterfly spread.
With calls, (and it can also be done with puts) the butterfly
spread consists of buying one call at the lowest strike price,
selling two calls at the middle strike price and buying one
call at the highest strike price. Next week, we will run the
complete strategy narrative again to help the beginning traders
with the technique.

INDEX OPTION SPREADS
********************
As a trader, you may be familiar with options on individual stocks
where you have the right to buy (call option) or the right to sell
(put option) a particular stock at some predetermined price within
some predetermined time. The buyer has the rights and the seller
the obligations. With index options the basic ideas are the same.
Index options allow you to make investment decisions on a specific
market industry or on the market as a whole. Spread strategies can
be made with index options similar to those made with individual
stock options. Many professional traders employ index spreads as a
hedge strategy. We favor debit positions on the SPX for momentum
and longer-term plays and OTM credit spreads on the OEX when the
risk/reward is favorable. Low ROI disparity spreads will be listed
(when available) for the conservative index trader.

OEX - S&P 100 Index  $610.38     OTM Credit-Spreads

The Standard & Poor's 100 Index is a capitalization-weighted index
of 100 stocks from a broad range of industries. The component
stocks are weighted according to the total market value of their
outstanding shares. The impact of a component's price change is
proportional to the issue's total market value, which is the share
price times the number of shares outstanding.

OBSERVATIONS:

For OTM credit spread trades, we like to use the actively-traded
S&P 100 Index options because they contain much more premium than
options on individual stocks and provide an underlying instrument
less prone to huge, gapping moves. Remember however, that you can
always be exercised early so monitor your positions daily.

TECHNICALS:

While the overall market seems likely to remain in a wide trading
range over the next few weeks, the probabilities are quite strong
that we have reached a short-term top and the current outlook is
somewhat unfavorable. The DOW has found some support just above a
key level around 9085 and a close below that number confirmed by
a S&P 500 close below 1205 would signal a more serious correction.
The long-term pattern is in a neutral but weakening condition with
the NYSE survey starting to slip and the NYSE momentum index at
its worst level in years. Review the Pinnacle Hedge-Section for
more specific technical information on the S&P 100 Index.

should sign the CA so that we can share information and hold further 
discussions to jointly develop the nature of the relationship.  In the LOI

therefore, we are not prepared to sign that.

Before I get legal and PR to look at this could you give me a bit more 
background on the potential arrangement with NextSet. I dont understand where 
the need for training will come in. 

I know that generally Enron has a policy of not being seen to endorse a 
client's products. PR may therefore have a problem with giving NextSet the 
ability to put our logo on their site. How important is this likely to be ?

Gillian and George,

Thanks again for stopping by this morning.  Per our conversation, I am
attaching a mutual NDA and a standard LOI.  With the former in place, we
should both be able to get a little deeper into the technology to see if
there is a strong fit between our respective companies.  I would be very
interested to introduce our CTO with your technology counterpart the next

Elaine:

Please coordinate with the legal department in London on these issues.  They 
are familiar with arranging for Enron Corp. guaranties.

MarkThanks for dealing with Tana on these issues.  It is not entirely clear to me 
what you want the policy to be regarding which counterparties have access to 
Australian power products.  You probably already know that the EnronOnline 
people want every counterparty everywhere in the world to have access to 
every product unless Credit or Legal can justify restricting their access.  
Credit already performs a financial test on each counterparty to determine if 
they meet the CFTC Eligible Swap Participant requirements.  Unfortunately, 
that test is not as restrictive as the Australian tangible assets test.  It 
sounds like there should be a US$6 million tangible assets test applied by 
Credit before we give any counterparty access to Australian Power (this would 
be a total pain but certainly possible).  On the other hand, if you feel 
comfortable giving access to non-Australian counterparties  without that test 
being performed, we can do that, too.  Pleas let me know if we should ask 
Credit to start performing this test on all counterparties or if it should be 
limited to Australian entities.Congratulations!  We'll have to chat soon.(h) Jurisdiction.  Section 13(b) is hereby deleted in its entirety and=20

Mark:  (1)  Did you consider my voice mail about updating authorized trader 
lists and resolutions (by Samantha or Tana)?

(2)  Have you thought about electronic notice provisions?  Shouldn't 
default/termination notices be in writing to the appropriate counsel/Corp. 
secretary?  And, can we agree to "electronic notices" at all?  There is no 
electronic address for a Documentation Desk or Assistant General Counsel.  I 
am seeing this type of provision in electronic trading agreements.

COVERED CALL SECTION FOR JANUARY 24, 1999
******************************************************************
The Lesson Begins..

This week, we are going to begin a new educational series on basic
covered-call techniques. The first step is to explain our current
approach and the appropriate method for using this much maligned
strategy.

The objective of covered writing for most investors is increased
income though stock ownership. By definition, the ideal covered
call offers reduced risk and a good probability of making a profit.
In fact, our primary goal is to provide the subscriber with plays
that produce acceptable returns while still receiving an above
average amount of protection.

A mathematical basis...

The main factor that we focus on is called "return unchanged".
This is the return on investment that one would achieve if the
stock price were unchanged at option expiration. One can compare
potential plays more accurately using this approach since no
assumption is made about stock price movement. This method ignores
the relative price of the sold strike (ITM - OTM) and focuses
completely on the overall position.

A very simple concept...

With this conservative option writing strategy in mind, we look
for plays that return a minimum of 3%-5% per month and retain
downside protection of at least 10% (of the current stock price).
The overall position that is constructed using these guidelines
will be a relatively low risk play (regardless of the volatility
of the underlying stock) since the levels of protection will be
large and there is still the expectation of a reasonable return.

Other things to consider...

The amount of downside protection and the return on investment are
both very important considerations in determining which play to
choose but the technical and fundamental outlook of the underlying
stock must also be favorable.

The reason for ITM plays...

A minimally acceptable return is somewhat a matter of personal
preference but with the current market volatility, it would appear
that the advantages of the in-the-money position, (more consistent
profits and reduced risk) is more attractive to the majority of
our investors.

Next week, we'll discuss more covered-call strategies. Good Luck!

We suggest you consider closing the MWY position. Last week, the
stock price fell below technical support after the company said
its revenues and earnings in the second half of its fiscal year
will be below last year's results. The company was downgraded by
Hambrecht & Quist and Piper Jaffray to a "hold".

CMTO - Com21 Inc.  $27.56     *** Hot Telecom Sector ***

Com21 produces modems, headends, and other equipment used by cable
communications operators to provide broadband access. Other items
include network management software and noise containment devices.
The company's "ComUNITY Access" allows cable operators to offer
multiple transmission rates to customers. The system also provides
high-speed Internet access to telecommuters, office/home users and
individuals and supports videoconferencing applications. Another
good earnings report on Thursday and a secondary stock offering of
3 mil shares. That includes 1 mil shares (no proceeds to CMTO) to
be sold by stockholders and the company will use the money for
general corporate purposes. The dilution is about -$1.18 per share.
Stage II climb with confirming technical indicators.

INFM - Infinium Software, Inc.  $6.13  *** Computer software ***

INFM develops/markets/supports business software applications for
the financial, human resource, and materials management functions
of organizations. Reported earnings Jan 21 and the current post-
earnings drop may offer an excellent buying opportunity.  EPS was
flat but revenues increased over 20% for the 8th straight quarter.
Our cost basis is below support and buying pressure has increased
over the last three trading days.

INVX - Innovex Inc.  $18.38  *** Dividends! ***

INVX develops and manufactures lead wire assemblies for computer
disk drives. They also design/manufacture flexible circuits and
chemically machined electrical components for the medical/computer
and communications industry. Price of stock spiked after company
settled (undisclosed) with ex-director. Friday, INVX declared an
increase in its regular quarterly dividend to $.04 per share,
payable 2/24/99, to SOR as of 2/10. Stock has strong support at
the cost basis. Buying pressure is off the scale and short term
technicals recently exhibited a "buy" signal.

RDRT - Read-Rite Corp.  $18.31  *** Technically Strong ***

Read-Rite Corporation designs, manufactures, and markets magnetic
recording heads for rigid disk drives. The tape always tells the
tale:  RDRT posted $0.02 profit (analyst predicted $0.17 loss) on
Wed. The key will be if the cost cutting and increased production
will work next quarter as current revenues did fall. Technically,
a very bullish chart with resistance around $25.

RNWK - RealNetworks, Inc.  $56.50  *** Internet volatility ***

RNWK provides branded software products and services enabling the
delivery of streaming media content over the Internet. Caution:
earnings due Jan 27. Recently upgraded/coverage initiated, as
RNWK announced alliances with AtHome and Enron Network.

Question: At what price would you mind owning RNWK? We think
$42.25 isn't that bad, right there at support, and just before
earnings (post earnings dip?). If we don't get it, a 6.5% ROI for
trying seems like just compensation.

SCIO is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture and
commercialization of novel human therapeutics, primarily
focused on cardiorenal disorders and Alzheimer's disease.
Lilly and SCIO agreed to continue their alliance on Alzheimer
research. Excellent cost basis with room to climb as resistance
is around $12.50. Buying pressure increasing with volume surge
bodes well for continued upward momentum.

SPNSF develops, markets and supports enterprise-wide solutions
for the rapid development of scaleable mission-critical software
applications. See last weeks write up. Here it is again, same

high on Tuesday. Does this pause offer another entry? Technical
health is still strong and actually improved slightly.

development of its lead angiogenesis inhibitor, SU5416, moving
directly from Phase I and Phase I/II studies into Phase III
colorectal and lung studies, and a Phase II/III study in
AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Some signs of increased buying

Xeikon N.V. develops, produces and markets digital color printing
systems and related consumables. A Technical play based on buying
pressure reversal. BOP indicated max selling two weeks ago and
has now crossed above zero and is increasing - with no news? Hmmm.
Closed at a new high on Wednesday with good MS and volume.

NAKED PUT SECTION FOR JANUARY 24, 1999
******************************************************************
Recently, we have had many questions about the margin requirements
for various option strategies. These new-subscriber requests also
contain questions about the necessary trading levels, margin, ROI
and collateral calculations for naked puts. We will try to cover
those subjects in the next few weeks. We start with definitions:

Writing a naked put...

A put writer assumes the obligation to buy the underlying security
at a specific price for a premium. There are two reasons for this
commitment; an investor unwilling to purchase stock at the current
price might write put options, hoping to take a position, (acquire
the stock) at a lower price. Another successful outcome is to just
receive the "premium" income if the stock remains above the sold
strike price. If the stock price finishes below the sold strike,
the seller (or writer) of the put option is obligated to purchase
the underlying stock (100 shares/contract) at the exercise price.
When this occurs, the cost of the stock (or the break-even) will
be the exercise price less the premium. When the sold strike price
goes "in-the-money", an investor must be ready to buy the stock at
any time because option contracts can be exercised early. The put
seller may also close the position by simply "buying-back" the
sold (short) put option.

The cost basis is simply the strike price minus premium received.
We list the cost basis of each play reference "owning the stock";
if it is PUT to you...

The collateral (or equity) required to sell a naked put varies for
different brokers. One of the most common formulas used by online
brokerages (Etrade for example) is:

The greater of :

40% of the current price of the stock plus the premium received,
minus the difference between the cost of the stock and the strike
price;

-or-

20% of the current price of the stock plus the premium received.

As you go deeper out of the money (OTM) the 20% requirement will
take precedence.

ROI is simply the premium received divided by the collateral (or
equity) required to open the position...

Example:
XYZ = 20.00, strike = 10.00, premium = 0.25
40% rule = 0.4*20 + 0.25 - ( 20-10) = -1.75
20% rule = 0.2*20 + 0.25 = 4.25
ROI = 0.25/4.25 =  5.88%

Next week, we will discuss the requirements for trading naked puts.

Good Luck!
------------------------------------------------------------------
                         *** WARNING ***
Occasionally a company will experience catastrophic news causing
a severe drop in the stock price. This may cause a devastatingly
large loss which may wipe out all of your smaller gains. There is
one very important rule; Don't sell naked puts on stocks that you
don't want to own! It is also important that you consider using
trading STOPS on naked option positions to help limit losses when
the stock price drops.

Hey guys - welcome home!  At least I assume you're home by now.  How was the 
trip?  I heard a bit about the departure but with any luck it must have 
gotten better.  Any hope you took digital pictures?

I have already told Linda but I wanted you both to know how great I thought 
your wedding was.  There is no doubt in my mind that it was the most special, 
beautiful, fun wedding I've ever been to.  Magical doesn't seem like too 
strong a word.  Thank you very much for letting me be part of it.  It's been 
about 30 years since I had been to that part of the world - it's easy to see 
why you enjoy it so much.  

I was serious about sailing in the Caribbean at Thanksgiving.  If you are 
still interested, we really need to start planning right away.  I tentatively 
booked a boat but the real difficulty may be in finding flights - it is a 
busy travel season.  Just let me know.

MarkThis was one of your competitors - at least from the legal side - that we 
looked at briefly about a year ago.

http://www.legalanywhere.com/legal/index.htmlGlad to hear the rest of your trip went well.  

The 'normal' sailing trip is a week but that's not cast in stone.  In an 
effort to maximize days sailing and minimize days of vacation taken we 
usually fly down on a Saturday arriving in the afternoon or eve., pick up the 
boat on Sunday (you get the boat around noon) and bring it back the following 
Sunday (by noon), take a shower and head straight for the airport.  Because 
of the way the flight schedules work it's usually not possible to leave after 
work on a Friday and make it all of the way down there.  You could do a 
shorter trip, of course, but I never have.  I've gone for longer (we did a 10 
day one-way sail from St. Lucia down to the southern end of Grenada, stopping 
in Bequia and Mustique, among others, along the way) but that's a pretty long 
trip and certainly not necessary.  Most of the charter fleets are based where 
there is plenty to do right in the area for a week.  One of the reasons for 
aiming at Thanksgiving was to reduce the total number of vacation days 
spent.  I get both Thurs & Fri off so I only have to spend 3 days to get a 
whole week - I understand the gov't may not be so generous.  I haven't taken 
all of my days this year so I can always carry some over to 2001 if that 
works better for you guys.

My views on when to go:

January - March 
Very fun since you will be sick of winter, very popular so a lot more crowded 
(harder to find a place to anchor for the night and have to make arrangements 
farther ahead), everything is open for business, high season rates.

April - May
Less crowded (unless Easter or Spring breaks are late), shoulder season rates.

June - August
No crowds (you may have some anchorages to yourself), many places are closed 
for the season (think beach bars and meals on shore), low rates.

September - October
See June-August and add in highest risk of hurricanes 
(http://www.storm2000.com).  My guess is that people who planned their trips 
to the BVI for this week aren't having much fun right now but they got  GREAT 
deals and the Moorings will probably give them a refund.  I've chartered 
during this period several times and had a blast.  One time a tropical storm 
came through and we stayed on the boat in port - I still get mileage out of 
the stories.  You just have to be willing to live with the risk that it may 
not go according to plan (not seriously dangerous, though - you're always 
within easy reach of the base - if a bad one threatens you just take the boat 
back and let them deal with it).

November - December
Hurricane threat drops dramatically.  Crowds pick up around Christmas, 
everything opens up again, rates start to go up again.

Bottom line:  I love the trips so much it doesn't matter what time of year - 
just let me know what works best for you guys.  Keep in mind that you do have 
to make arrangements at least 2 months in advance (more is better) to make 
sure you get flights and the boat that you want.

One last thought - it is possible for the main group to pick up the boat on 
schedule and arrange to be near the airport on a later day in the trip to 
pick someone up.  This is definitely suboptimal.  You learn a lot about the 
boat and the sailing area from the briefings the charter company gives you at 
the start and it limits flexibility to have to be by the airport on a certain 
day when you might rather have the boat at the other end of the island chain 
or wherever.  I'd rather put the whole thing off until we can all go at once 
but if it's the only way, at least it's an option.

I haven't seen any of the press reports (even though I am in London and I 
hear that's where they were) but I thought this was a well drafted response.  
The only additional rumours I have heard indicate that the police may have 
been rough in their handling of demonstrators outside the fence at the plant 
construction site.  I remember hearing that there were times that the 
construction workers feared for their lives because of the vehemence of the 
protesters.  I guess that didn't make it into the Human Rights Watch (ever 
heard of them?) report.

To:      All Employees
From:    Ken Lay & Jeff Skilling
Subject: Human Rights Watch

Over the next few days, you may see some press coverage of a report that was 
issued by the Human Rights Watch which alleges human rights abuses in 
relation to the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) project in India. As you know, 
Enron is a 50 percent owner of the Dabhol project, which should be 
operational next month.

We want each of you to know that this report is entirely without basis.  We 
are very disappointed that Human Rights Watch has chosen to listen to the 
perspectives of the people who have opposed the project since the beginning. 
As you are probably aware, project opponents filed more than 20 lawsuits 
against the project in the Indian courts over the past four years.  Every 
lawsuit was dismissed, withdrawn or ruled in DPC's favor.  The project is 
clearly above reproach.

Enron was advised of the Human Rights report just a few days before it was 
issued.  The Dabhol Power Company, the Government of Maharashtra and our many 
supporters were never even contacted.

DPC has worked hard to promote positive relations within the community.  A 
handful of people who oppose the project were interviewed for this report in 
great detail.  Unfortunately, the good relationships we have built with a 
large percentage of the community were not reflected.  Our community efforts 
have included building a school and a hospital, planting thousands of trees 
at the site, building wells for drinking water and conducting numerous job 
training programs for area residents. Last year, Enron made a $500,000 grant 
to CARE to be used for programs in the state of Maharashtra.

Our media statement on the issue is as follows:

Dabhol Power Company does not tolerate human rights abuses by its employees 
or contractors.  And, while we respect the work of Human Rights Watch and its 
mission, this report is out of context at best and dredges up allegations 
that have been put to rest over the past four years.  Much of the report 
deals with concerns over state police actions, over which we have no control, 
and it is misleading by Human Rights Watch to allege so.

Please refer any media inquiries to the Enron International public relations 
office at 713-646-6416.

Alan-

Attached hereto, are marked-up copies of the following ISDA documents (based 
on the US versions) which have been prepared using the credit worksheet for 
The Mitsui Marine & Fire Insurance Co., Limited, in conjunction with B&M:

ISDA Schedule,
CSA and
Enron Corp. Guarantee.

The footnotes will disappear when the changes to the document are accepted.  
It will be relatively straight forward to revise these for other 
counterparties
such as IBJ and Sanwa, which apparently have the same credit rating.  I note 
that we have not yet received the credit work sheet for IBJ or Sanwa.

Please note:

1.  There are still a number of "options" in the documents which I have not 
completed as I am unsure as to the desired outcome.  These are indicated in 
square
brackets.  Please let me know how you would like to deal with these;

2.   It will be important to make sure that the documents are carefully 
checked to ensure that we have properly incorporated the various elections in 
the documents;

3.   The agreements are governed by New York law and we should ensure that 
appropriate counsel reviews same;and

4.   A number of features in the agreements (particularly the requirement for 
a legal opinion and the use of L/Cs as form of collateral) are not common in
Japan and are likely to meet resistance from our counterparties.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

John

I'm just a lawyer and as such still operating pretty much in the stone age.  
The easiest way for me to look at something that is primarily text (minimal

I didn't think we were confirming transactions between books, but maybe this 
is a first that crossed company lines - I would think we would confirm it 
through RMT as one ENA RMT trade and another RMT EPMI trade.  I'm assuming 
that the reference to EPMI Long Term Hedge is an EnronOnline reference to one 
of the EPMI trading desks and therefore it should be done as an EPMI trade.

Susan/Tana,

We have recently traded a deal on Enron Online in which the entity offering 
the trade was ENA and the entity entering the trade was EPMI Long Term Hedge 
(Power group hedging with ENA).  This is currently booked as RMT vs. EPMI 
Long Term Hedge.  Can we send out a confirmation based on ISDA terms since 
this is an Enron subsidiary per Global Counterparty?  I'm assuming this is 
just like doing a deal with Enron Global Exploration and Production, EES or 
ECT International, but let me know if I'm incorrect.

Thanks,
Joe



Dear John:

So sorry for the delay.  I hope it hasn't caused too much inconvenience.  I 
would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I don't have 
your phone number!   Here are my comments to the draft documents you sent:

Part 1 (b)  In our other derivatives trading, the cross default test applies 
to Enron Corp. with a Threshold of US$100,000,000.  To accomplish this in the 
schedule, Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit 
Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp. guaranty and the 
dollar figure adjusted accordingly.

Part 1 (d)  Has Baker & McKenzie recommended this?  We rely on local counsel 
advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a 
bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be.  The risk in the 
automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even 
aware of the situation, i.e. the outstanding transactions terminate 
automatically, leaving us with an open, unhedged position which we are not 
able to protect since we are not aware of it.  In the U.S. the bankruptcy 
code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the 
terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge.

Part 1 (e)  We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the 
non-defaulting party the most flexibility.  Market Quotation is often 
suggested because of its apparent objective nature.  However, in many of the 
markets where we operate, quotations will not be available, where they are 
available they may well not be meaningful, and the Loss method gives 
flexibility (while still requiring commercial reasonableness).

Part 1 (h)(ix)  This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is 
no collateral annex.   When we have the ability to ask for (or be asked for) 
collateral in the case of a downgrading, we build that event into the 
Paragraph 13 to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires 
the posting of collateral to cover any open position.  If the party fails, it 
then becomes a default allowing termination.

Part 1 (h)(x)  Wouldn't the cross default be triggered before this could 
happen?

Part 2  Have our internal Tax people approved this?

Part 3  I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of 
the corporate documents referred to.  Since Enron Corp. will be a Credit 
Support Provider, does it have a Representative Director, etc.?

The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does 
not think it necessary.  In many non-US jurisdictions, local counsel have 
advised that an opinion be obtained - in some cases derivatives transactions 
are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business 
and therefore require special board approval; in others, derivatives would 
not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made 
in the corporate documents, etc.

Part 5 (b) (g)&(h) These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind 
(although they may be helpful for other reasons as well).  If neither party 
is in the US, the CFTC reason may go away.  On the other hand, since we are 
choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law 
applies as well.  If that is our theory, there are additional representations 
(the Eligible Swap Participant reps) that we should think about putting back 
in.

Part 5 (d)  We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section 
to make reference to the ISDA 2000 definitions.  While I think we will get 
there, we haven't actually made the decision yet.  So far I guess we leave it 
the way it is.

Part 5 (j)  My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp. 
guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity.  Any differences in 
Japan from US practice we should be worried about?

Paragraph 13  I have to admit I'm not as familiar with the Paragraph 13 
provisions as the Schedule.  My only concern here is with the MAC clause and 
it looks like there's a glitch in the form.  It seems to me that if the 
counterparty is only rated by one of the 2 major agencies we shouldn't be 
pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us.  The way it is 
drafted now if either S&P or Moody's stops rating us, even if the remaining 
rating is very high we will have a MAC occur.  The counterparty doesn't have 
to worry about Moody's at all.  Just a thought.

On the guaranty, you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction 
changes past Clement Abrams at Corp. Legal.  My only comment is that we would 
usually have a cap that is a bit higher (in this case maybe an extra 
$5,000,000) than the threshold in the CSA - that gives the counterparty a 
little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is 
exceeded.

Tana is preparing a red-line for me that hopefully will show all of the 
changes between the US form and the Japan form.  I may have a few more 
comments after I see how that comes out but don't expect many.

I hope this is helpful.  Please feel free to call and we can walk through 
these over the phone if that would be useful.  We should also talk about the 
most efficient way to prepare these going forward.  It might make sense for 
Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft 
which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty.  It 
may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on 
other things.

We're looking forward to having you back.

Mark,

Further to our conversation today; How is this?

You have offered a price limit order for aaa mmbtus of yyyyy at a price of 
xxx. If the price you specified becomes available on EnronOnline, the system 
will automatically try to fill your submission and a transaction may result.  
Your submission may be filled partially or completely depending on the volume 
available. This submission will remain active until for the earlier of (i) xx 
hours and yy minutes from your submission, or  (ii) until you cancel it (by 
highlighting it and pressing the cancel button on the main screen), or (iii) 
the end of the day. The submission  will not be withdrawn by your logout. 
Price limit orders are processed by price and then by timestamp. Therefore, 
if other price limit orders for the same price have been submitted before 
yours, then they will be filled before your submission is filled. This can 
result in other transactions completing at the same price as your price limit 
order, while your price limit order does not complete.

Dave - my comments are below in red.  I'm assuming that "end of the day" is 
the end of the trading day, but this seems a bit ambiguous since the trader 
in Japan may be thinking about a different "day" than the trader in London, 
etc.  Will the orders be cancelled if our trader removes a product during the 
day and then reactivates it?

Mark,

Further to our conversation today; How is this?

You have offered a price limit order for aaa mmbtus of yyyyy at a price of 
xxx. If the price you specified becomes available on EnronOnline, the system 
will automatically try to fill your submission and a transaction may result.  
Your submission may be filled partially or completely depending on the volume 
available. This submission will remain active until for the earlier of (i) xx 
hours and yy minutes from your submission, or  (ii) until you cancel it (by 
highlighting it and pressing the cancel button on the main screen), or (iii) 
the end of the day. The submission  will not be withdrawn by your logout. 
Price limit orders are processed by price and then by timestamp. Therefore, 
if other price limit orders for the same price have been submitted before 
yours, then they will be filled before your submission is filled. This can 
result in other transactions completing at the same price as your price limit 
order, while your price limit order does not complete.

		 Subject: Guest access Chile

Hello Mark,

Justin Boyd told me that your can help me with questions regarding Chile.
We got a request for guest access through MG.
The company is called Escondida and is a subsidiary of BHP Australia.

Please advise if I can set up a guest account or not.
F.Y.I.: MG is planning to put a "in w/h Chile" contract for Copper on-line as 
soon as Enron has done the due diligence for this country.
Thanks !


Best regards

I think there should be a Master Swap Agreement in place between ECT and EI.  
I suggest you check in Lotus Notes but I'm pretty sure Lisa did one about a 
year ago.

Subject: Re: Umbrella agreements between EI and ECT  

Hi Heather,
There is no umbrella agreement between EI and ECT at present. We will need 
(i) an ISDA Master Agreement  and (ii) depending on the risk assessment of 
the transaction by ECT's Credit Group and the benefit allocation of such 
transaction, a risk allocation/assumption agreement, in each case, between 
the parties. I have left a message for Tanya Rohauer of the Credit Group and 
will keep you posted.

I definitely need to send Aspect a letter.  Per Fred Lagrasta, we would like

Per our conversation I am attaching the Margin Call notification that was 
sent to Aspect Resources.  As I mentioned, Wayne Williamson has received this 
notice.   We do have someone looking further into Aspect's financials, but we 
do feel that there might br a need to send a letter to Aspect regarding a 
Margin Call cancellation.  Thanks in advance for your assistance.

*************************************************************

The Internets blew out and techs followed. The broader market
took all day to catch up.


After another night passed without a global meltdown the
market got off to a cautious start this morning. The Dow
traded in a narrow range until a small dip at noon but the
dip appeared to be the signal for buyers to come off the
sidelines.

The techs jumped out to a quick lead and the Nasdaq hovered
in the high +30 range for what seemed like forever but then
finally surged to another record close.

The combination of strong earnings reports and multiple
stock splits powered the market forward. As soon as traders
saw the market was not going down after the bump at the open
they jumped in not wanting to be left behind.

IBM surprised no one when they announced a 2:1 split.
MCD also announced a 2:1 and joined the recent ranks of
other splitters MSFT and XRX who announced yesterday.
The stock split craze is not over yet. BRCM and EBAY both
announced splits after the close. EBAY a 3:1 and BRCM 2:1.

It appears that nothing can stop MSFT as it added 9.69
today (they are over +15 for the week).  After such a
strong move, we are looking for some kind of pullback.
The rest of the Nasdaq 100's top four did well too.
INTC rose 6.31 while CSCO jumped up 3.69 and DELL leaped
up another 3.63.  Definitely a good day for the techs.

Not to be outdone, AOL added $9.00 in anticipation of
their own earnings announcement tomorrow.  Odds of a
split are strong but there is always an increased
risk associated with holding over earnings.  It wouldn't
surprise us to some profit taking before the close
tomorrow (quite similar to what happened to SUNW the
day of their earnings).

Compaq Computer announced today that they were going to
spin off Alta Vista as a separate company. This positive
news fired up the Internets early in the day.

As if they needed to add any fuel to the Internet explosion
Amazon announced earnings (or lack thereof) that beat the
street by +.04. That along with the EBAY and BRCM splits
had all the parties celebrating after the bell. EBAY was
up +18 and AMZN +7 in after hours. No numbers were available
for BRCM.

The market internals were negative until the last hour.
It just seemed that the buyers were holding back and only
reluctantly moving back into the market like swimmers in
the ocean after a shark sighting. Everyone KNEW they
should be buying but they wanted someone else to go first.

The fear of being Greenspamed on Thursday was probably
weighing on some and lingering Brazil/China worries on
others. The market is still a little top heavy here after
the big run in recent weeks. Yes we backed off -500 points
but some say this was not enough. We have always expected
the better than expected earnings would have traders
re-evaluating their estimates for 1999. Now it appears
that the current S&P average of companies reporting is
a +6.3% year over year increase in earnings. The historical
average is around +7% but due to the global slowdown the
current estimates had been for only +5% growth.

With almost 50% of the S&P-500 already reported we are
seeing a better than 2:1 ratio of positive surprises
compared to negative surprises.

We could have some profit taking again Wednesday night
as fear of Greenspan takes hold but we feel that he will
not harm the market intentionally. Almost nothing can harm
this market. Sure there will be some dips but for the next
two weeks the trend should be up. After the two up days
this week we could actually see some drop at the open again
tomorrow as minor profit taking occurs.


Good Luck

The OEX Skybox is Back - New & Improved
***********************************************************

Based upon subscriber demand, the OEX Skybox is coming back.
OptionInvestor.com is please to announce that Pinnacle
Capital Advisors will be bringing its popular OEX Skybox back
to OI's advisory website this weekend and updating it DAILY.

And what better day to bring the OEX Skybox back than on
Superbowl Sunday, January 31st.  Unlike other OEX trading
systems, the OEX Skybox was designed to give subscribers a
"top down" view of this popular S&P 100 index option.  And in
a time of market volatility and uncertainty, sometimes one
needs to step away from the trading pit to see the big
picture from the "Skybox" and explore a broader range of
trading strategies and opportunities.

The OEX Skybox was first introduced by Pinnacle on November 1,
1998 and its team of experienced OEX traders generated an
impressive 292% over two short months.  The OEX Skybox will
supercede the OEX trading Pit and offer more ways for
subscribers to participate in the popular index option.

"We are excited to deliver the OEX Skybox to the number one
option advisory service on the Internet", says Austin Tanner,
Pinnacle's president.  According to Pinnacle, one of the
pitfalls of trading the OEX is getting caught up in the
intraday ticks and overtrading.  The focus of the OEX Skybox
is benchmark trading and gives OI subscribers winning trading
opportunities without all the noise.

What's unique about the OEX Skybox is Pinnacle's disciplined,
market-neutral trading approach that initiates trades at key
turning points in the market.  These turning points or
"benchmarks" are determined using time-tested technical and
sentiment indicators.

The new and improved DAILY OEX Skybox service will provide a
nightly OEX market wrap on the website that outlines
Pinnacle's OEX market posture and option strategies for the
next day.  During each trading day, the OEX Skybox will be
updated in realtime at three key time periods during the day.
The benefit of our fixed time period updates is that
subscribers can count on getting key trading instructions
when they login.

Nightly Strategy:
OEX Market Wrap           8:00 -  8:30pm EST

Daily Realtime Updates:
Before the Open           9:00 -  9:30am EST
After the Opening        11:00 - 11:30am EST
Before the Close          3:00 -  3:30pm EST

The nightly updates are designed for OEX traders who want to
trade the OEX but can't follow the OEX tick by tick during
the day.  The daily real-time updates give more active
day traders the ability to initiate and protect positions
quicker based upon fast developing news and events.


The change over will take place starting with Sunday's
newsletter and Mondays trading.

Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
******************************************************

Tuesday, January 26, 1999

Watch Option Call/Put Activity

Despite economic uncertainly in Brazil, we did not see an
increase in put activity over the past couple of days.  This
suggests that we DO NOT have strong underlying sentiment support
Next, we are focused on Call activity, particularly following
favorable earnings reports and stock splits.  If the options
speculators get ahead of themselves, it could presage a near
term top.

One positive development is the Market Volatility Index
(VIX) has closed BELOW 30.0% (29.35%).  This has Bullish overtones especially 
if the VIX resumes its declining trend which began back on October 8th.

Other sentiment indicators are still flashing BEARISH
overtones over the near-term including the Investors
Intelligence survey (60% Bullish) so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.  Any questions regarding
market sentiment can be directed at:

The Power of Expectation Analysis

It has often been said that the crowd is right during the
market trends but wrong at both ends.  Measuring and
evaluating the sentiment of the crowd, therefore, can give
savvy option traders a decided edge.

PICKS WE DROPPED
****************
When we drop a pick it doesn't mean we are recommending a sell
on that play. Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.
We drop a pick because something happened to change its
profile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we
don't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.
We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are
unfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we
want them to look at any current pick as a valid play.

CALLS:
******

AMGN $112.75 1.44 (-1.88) Amgen is an example of a stock that
should have been bought using the target shooting approach.
If you tried target shooting, you may have been filled in the
early morning and wound up with a profitable trade.  Amgen was
down nearly $4.00 in the first hour of trading Monday. In the
middle of the day, it climbed back to hover around $114.00
until the close. Today the trend was down again until late in
the day, when buyers moved in to buy the dip, but still left
it lower on the day. While the Nasdaq is up strong, Amgen is
not performing the way we had hoped, so we are dropping it.
However, there is the possibility of a split announcement
with earnings.  Unfortunately, there is more than one earnings
date available for AMGN.  Some sources say Jan. 27th others
say Jan. 28th.  AMGN last split 2:1 in August of 1995 in the
mid-90s.

T $86.88 -2.75 (-1.37)  Earnings announcement (met
expectations), share buyback, stock split, TCI merger --
the news is already out.  Right now, there's not much left
to move AT&T higher.  To be good plays, we think almost two
times a company's normal volume should produce nice gains.
Instead, over the last 2 days, AT&T went down in a strong
upward market.  In short, the play looks over for now so
we are dropping AT&T.

QWST $56.13 -2.56 (-4.00)  QWST has shown some weakness so
far this week.  It dove -$4.00 even in a market that seems
to be moving upwards.  On Tuesday, Lehman Brothers cut its
rating to outperform from their previous buy recommendation.
They think competition will increase from other companies
like MCI WorldCom Inc. and AT&T.  By taking a look at their
chart, it is easy to see that QWST is on the downside of the
hill. We are dropping Qwest as one of our plays until it
makes a definite turn-around and regains some upward
momentum.

PRIA $32.19 -.81 (-3.69) PRIA gave us a good, steady
momentum run.  But earnings are only 2 days away, and it
looks like it is rolling over and heading lower, so we are
dropping it.  Remember, we don't recommend holding over
earnings due to the increased risk.  Make your own decision
based on your risk/reward profile.

PUTS:
******

MCHP - $32.00 1.25 (1.81)  Stock recovered nearly $2 after
being downgraded by Alex Brown. Stock trading below
consolidation of $36-40 but above last Novembers break out
price of $30.00. Dropping after stock appears to holding at
retracement price of $30.

PKN - $96.31  5.44 (5.00) Advanced higher with broad market
off of 50 day moving average.  Dropping until stock rolls
over again.

PICK NEWS - CALLS
*******************************************************

EMC $101.75 -.25 (+3.25) EMC announced earnings today and beat
estimates by 2 cents per share.  Revenue for the quarter
increased 36% over the year ago period and net income increased
54% versus the same period last year.  EMC also projects
revenue growth in 1999 to be 30% or more and sales to pick up
in Asia.  Software revenues grew by 175%.  EMC traded down only
a little today, which is good news since they didn't blow away
the estimates.  EMC still has some room to move before it runs
into the 52 week high it set last week.

UTX $117.25 +1.44 (+2.69) UTX set a new 52 week high today at
$117.63.  The downgrade that UTX got after the close on Friday
really didn't impact it all that much.  UTX traded flat for the
first half of Monday and then started up.  We haven't had any
news on UTX so it is living off of its earnings release last
week and the upward movement of the Dow.  Remember when trading
UTX, it is a Dow 30 component and is very Dow sensitive.

ORCL $52.88 +1.81 (+3.00) We said ORCL might be a candidate for
some target shooting around its 10 day moving average, but it
hasn't been anywhere near it this week.  It was good to see
ORCL move through $52 today.  It had been having some trouble
with this level.  In the news, ORCL announced new software for
oil exploration and production companies.  It will allow oil
industry co-venture partners and newly merged oil companies to
share information and monitor asset performance asset
performance quickly, easily and collaboratively.  The oil
industry can use all the help they can get given the low price
of oil these days.  The new software uses ORCL's new Internet
database  Oracle8i.

DELL $88.50 +3.63 (+5.50)  Without news or
fanfare, Dell set a new all-time closing high today on
slightly less than average volume, indicating a lack of
sellers.  Dell is now sitting at its resistance of $88.50.
If Dell can push through this on more than 18 million
shares, the sky is the limit on its way to earnings
scheduled for February 16 after the close.  If volume
doesn't materialize, that's OK.  It just means that Dell
will be a little more susceptible to a pullback.  In
Technology Business Research's 4th Quarter Corporate IT
Buying Behavior and Customer Satisfaction Study, conducted
with 300 F1000 IT Managers, Dell continues as the number
one vendor for customer satisfaction across notebook,
desktop and server platforms.  Nice chart; its not too late
to scale into a position for earnings.  Dips are buyable,
but would rather confirm upward movement first.

CSCO $107.13 +3.69 (+4.32)  Thank goodness
for the last hour of trading.  Without it, CSCO would be up
only $2 this week; not very inspiring considering CSCO is
the third largest component of the NASDAQ 100, which set a
new high today.  Cisco's saving grace: genuine buying
interest (not just market sympathy) shows volume 11% above
average in today's trading.  We are playing CSCO as a split
candidate and earnings run.  CSCO has enough shares
authorized to announce a 3:2 split on February 2 after the
close, along with earnings, just 5 trading days away.  CSCO
continues receive new awards for building the new wave of
telecom technology.  Today, CSCO was selected as Sprint's
primary supplier of DSL technology for building out "last
mile" broadband access solutions to Sprint's next-
generation Sprint ION(SM), Integrated On-Demand Network,
and for DSL-based services for customers of Sprint's Local
Telecommunications Division (LTD), beginning in 1999
(Business Wire).  The run has begun.  Dips are buyable.
Confirm upward movement first and use stops to protect your
profits.

AOL $154.84 +8.84 (+14.40)  Whew!!  All we
can say is "It's about time".  In Sunday's letter, we noted
that we expected a bounce off the moving average, out of
consolidation running toward earnings.  We got it.  Volume
has been slightly below average this week causing us slight
anxiety.  But with a 14-point gain in 2 days, we'll get
over it.  Tomorrow, after 5:00 p.m. ET, AOL announces
earnings along with what we also hope to be a split
announcement; probably 2:1, although there are enough
shares outstanding to declare a 3:1.  We expect great
results from the record number of new subscribers and
surprising Holiday sales volumes. We don't normally
recommend holding over earnings so evaluate your risk
tolerance if you opt to hold through on this play.
Intestinal fortitude still required.

WCOM $77.94 +0.25 (+3.06)  WCOM should have
performed better today given the new NASDAQ record, but
we're still up $3 for the week under it's resistance level
of $80 on slightly higher than average volume.  To be safe,
wait for a pullback confirmed by reversal, or until WCOM
breaks $80 and holds.  The U.S Supreme Court's ruling
yesterday to force the baby bells to open their markets to
competition had little effect on moving the price up.  A
downgrade issued by Kauffman Bros. from "buy" to "hold"
didn't help.  Confirm sector movement before starting a new
play.

Mark:  Someone has put 5 boxes and a redwell of files that apparently 
belonged to Yao Apasu into the file room.  I'm sure you know that there is a 
process for sending purged files and completed transaction files to the file 
room through me so that I may enter them into the file room database. 

Where can those files be moved so that someone from the trading group can 
weed them?   I'm sorry to add this to your departmental duties, but they do 
need to be moved.  I'm going to send a memo that nothing is to be put into 
the file room without coming through my office for processing.

I am copying Julia with this note because we have been discussing file 
retention policies relating to the move and the availability of space on the 
floor.

Thanks,

		 Subject: Dayrate Cap Indicative Proposal to Noble Drilling

Dear Mark Taylor,

Please review the language below; it is a first attempt at making a non 
binding proposal to Noble Drilling.  Please return your approved language 
asap.

Thanks
John A. Peyton



Dear Mark Mey,

We appreciate your interest in our new dayrate financial products.  

For your consideration, we would like to indicatively propose a transaction 
in which Enron North America would purchase a Financial Call Option ("Cap") 
from Noble Drilling Corporation for the Calculation Period  April 1, 2001 
through June 30, 2001 for one Rig.  The Strike Price would be $65,000 per 
(Rig*Day) and the premium which we would pay to Noble Drilling Corporation 
(within Five Business Days of the Trade Date) would be US Dollars $200,000.

The Commodity Reference Price would be the arithmetic mean of the high and 
low Rig Day Rates for JU-300'-IC as published by Offshore Data Services, 
Inc., or its successor, in the last issue of Gulf of Mexico Weekly Rig 
Locator, or any successor publication, published during the applicable 
Calculation Period, on the page entitled "Gulf of Mexico Rig Utilization and 
Day Rates".  The Payment Date(s) would be the fifth (5th) Business Day 
following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.

We have authority to enter into the above this type of transaction and would 
be able to move quickly toward providing you with an executable contract.  
Because the market for dayrates is highly volatile [and because we may have 
made similar proposals to other counterparties] (is this true?), this 
indicative proposal is only good until August 31st, 2000.  We look forward to 
further discussions. 

This document contains indicative terms only and is not intended to create a 
binding or enforceable contract nor is it an offer or commitment to enter 
into any transaction.  All terms are subject to change until agreement as to 
a specific transaction has been reached.  ENA is not acting as a fiduciary or 
advisor and you should evaluate and understand the terms, conditions, and 
risks of all transactions in making your decisions with respect thereto.  The 
proposal described herein is subject to further review and approval by ENA 
and Counterparty and, among other matters, further review and approval of the 
board of directors of each party, and the negotiations, execution and 
delivery of definitive agreements containing all appropriate provisions, 
including those related to credit, limitations of damages and others.

Sincerely,

John A. Peyton
Director
Enron North America

		 Subject: Conference in Washington, D.C.

Sparks Companies is an outside ag industry consultant that Gary and his group 
have retained.  Sparks has a Washington office, and two of the principals of 
that office are putting on a presentation for us in D.C. on Sept. 14.  The 
focus of the presentation is ag law and policy and where Sparks sees things 
going over the next two years.

In addition to Gary and Elsa, Chris Long and Lisa Yoho of the public affairs 
department will attend, and I think it would be helpful for me to attend as 
well.  The presentation is scheduled from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., so I should be 
able to fly up that day and return that evening.

Please let me know your thoughts on this.  If you agree, I will have Brenda 
make travel arrangements for me.  Thanks -- Bob

PICK NEWS - CALLS (continued)
*******************************************************

MSFT $171.56 +9.69 (+15.31)  Wow!!  It doesn't
get much better than this.  MSFT announced their 2:1 stock
split (effective 3/26) prior to yesterday's market open and
immediately gapped-up at the opening.  Those of you still
in the play going into last weekend were richly rewarded
Monday Morning.  Everyone wants to own MSFT and nobody
wants to sell.  This sentiment on 2 times normal volume
produced a textbook run-up -- as if "astrodollar" earnings
aren't enough.  Price targets are now at $200.  Of note,
MSFT announced they would phase in Alta-Vista, Compaq's to-
be-spun-off-in-an-IPO search engine, and ease out Inktomi.
Use stops to protect your profits.  With so much money on
the table, we suggest waiting for a pullback before
starting a new play.  As always, confirm market direction
first.

DH $60.88 +0.63 (+0.94)  As we said Sunday,
not a fast mover, but a steady gainer. 1189 institutions
own 89.5% of the 395 million shares in float leaving about
40 million shares in daily float to trade.  On average
volume of 2 million shares, DH traded within $1.50 range
both days this week, sheltering investors from a tumultuous
market. Look for the rise to continue, market permitting.
Slow news week so far; nothing to move the price.  Just
hare-speed momentum.  Dayton Hudson is the parent company
of Target Stores

VIA.B $81.88 -1.13 (-0.68)  Profit taking has caused a slight
dip in Viacom.  But, it has been so small that it actually can
be interpreted as a positive sign for the stock.  VIA.B seems
to undergo an occasional consolidation.  Then it goes on its
merry way.  As always, wait for the signal to turn green
before hitting the gas.  Blockbuster Inc., a subsidiary of
Viacom, teamed up with Warner Home Video in a revenue sharing
agreement.   As a result, Blockbuster will be able to rent
more new releases and other videos to its customers.  Chyron
Corporation will deliver Liberty NT software to an affiliate
of Paramount which is partially owned by Viacom.  The new
system will allow access to paint and animation capabilities
on the Windows NT platform.

WAG $59.50 +1.13 (+1.06)  On Tuesday, Walgreen's flexed its
muscles in a display strength and closed at it's high for the
day.  Its only resistance is at it's all time high set back in
December at $60.44.  With its 2:1 stock split scheduled for
Feb. 12th, it appears WAG is getting in shape to make a nice
run.

LXK $108.00 +3.88 (+8.75) Well, we have good news and bad news
on LXK this week.  Let's start with the bad news.  LXK did
not announce a stock split with earnings.  Their annual
shareholder meeting isn't until April, so a stock split
announcement would have to come on an arbitrary day.  We
noticed that companies, like Microsoft, have held off a few
days before announcing their splits.  This might be a ploy
to take the price high on the earnings announcement and then
take it higher with the split announcement.  The good news
is that LXK announced earnings of $1.16 a share.  This was
$.05 above consensus estimates.  The company also stated
there is a high demand for printer components.  LXK is in
blue-sky territory as it has broken through any prior
resistance.

VOD $193.50 +2.88 (+5.12) VOD has come back to life the last
two trading days with gains of $2.88 and $2.24.  There isn't
any recent news on VOD, but there is one very positive
technical aspect.  The last three trading days have seen
VOD close right at the high of the day.  This shows a very
bullish tendency as the bulls seem to be winning the battle
on a daily basis.

XIRC $42.31 +.38 (+.31) XIRC seems to have entered a
consolidation phase.  The volatility was pretty high before
earnings, but the daily range has decreased substantially
the last three trading days.  We still feel this stock is a
good purchase.  Watch for a strong up-move on good volume.
XIRC's 52-week high is at $44.50.  A move through this level
should provide a nice rally.  XIRC did announce today that
they will provide wireless data support for Siemans handsets.

SNC $39.50 +.56 (+1.75) SNC continued to rise today, albeit
at a smaller pace.  No news on SNC, but earnings are around
the 10th of February and SNC has historically had nice
earnings surprises.  There isn't much of a chance of an
upgrade for this stock, being that the five analysts that
follow it all rank it a strong buy.  We guess there could be
a new analyst recommendation.  We could see a continued run
into earnings.  SNC's 52-week high is $54.18.

XLNX $82.56 +5.44 (+4.37) XLNX did the job on Tuesday with
over a 6% gain.  XLNX has done what a lot of stocks do after
announcing great earnings and a stock split and that is to
consolidate briefly and then continue up.  XLNX dropped on
Monday, but came back with a vengeance on Tuesday. XLNX's
resistance is at its 52-week high of $87.63.  Pullbacks
would be good buying opportunities.

MU $71.88 +2.88 (+1.38) Micron showed some weakness on Monday
in a mixed semi-conductor market. It was off $1.50 even as a
few of the other chip stocks moved up in sympathy with LSI
Logic.  LSI had received an upgrade from hold to strong buy.
Today, however, MU was up $2.88 in a generally strong semi-
conductor sector. Any upgrades and strong earnings from other
stocks in the sector, as well as from the hardware stocks,
should help MU.  Like Dell, it reports later in the earnings
season, so an earnings run would start a little later.
Earnings in February.

NOKA $145.38 +1.38 (+.82) After hitting $155.38 on Wednesday,
Jan. 20th, Nokia has gapped down at the open each of the last
four trading days. It has also CLOSED well above its opening
price the last few days, and today it managed to close $1.38
above yesterday's close. This company is located in Finland
and trades in Europe while we sleep. The Europeans seem to be
sending the stock lower while the Americans are sending it
back up each day on the NYSE. Only two days left for an
earnings run--earnings are due out before the bell on Friday.
We believe that there is a good possibility of a split
announcement with earnings. If you don't want to risk holding
over earnings, be sure to sell your options before the close
on Thursday.  You can pick them up again if a split is announced.
That is the conservative way to make this play. If you hold over,
you risk a loss of capital, should Nokia disappoint. For those
of you with high risk tolerance, please note that Nokia jumped
$9 the day it announced it's last split.  It then ran up another
$34 before the split.

ANF - Abercrombie & Fitch $73.94 +2.06 (+4.19 for the week)

Abercrombie & Fitch sells men's and women's casual clothes
and accessories in over 170 stores across America.  Their
comfortable styles of jeans and crews are especially popular
with teens and college students.  Check out this Volkswagen
hip-hop retailer the next time you are strolling through
the mall.

Abercrombie has established a nice upward trend since its
lows in October.  It has been virtually unstoppable with
only two minor bouts of profit taking along the way.  In
intraday trading on Tuesday, ANF set another all-time high
at the $75 level.  Look for ANF to continue its steady trend
into blue skies.  There hasn't been a lot of news as of late
for Abercrombie.  But, back on Jan 8th, an article in Reuters
commented that since American Eagle Outfitters had posted
nice sales figures, it was safe to assume that Abercrombie
could do the same.

SEPR - Sepracor Inc. $104.25 +2.50 (+4.75 for the week)

Sepracor Inc. is a company that researches, develops, and
sells chemicals that are new, patented forms of existing
pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical compounds.  These
products are made to reduce the side effects and increase
the safety of drugs already on the market today.  They are
used to treat several conditions that include asthma,
allergies, pain, and insomnia.  As an example, SEPR
developed Allegra as an alternative to Seldane which lost
FDA approval in 1997.

Sepracor Inc. has a stellar graph.  The company has been on
an uptrend since it was at the $40 level back in June and
in intraday trading Tuesday, SEPR set another all time high
at $105.50.  Last Friday, Jan. 22nd, BancBoston Robertson
Stephens initiated coverage of this steady stock with a
"long-term attractive rating."  They projected a 12-month
price target of $112.  They seem to favor this company which
has two approved drugs and six drugs in late phase clinical
development.  Look for SEPR to continue its upward trek if
current market conditions remain steady.

WMT - Wal-Mart $83.56 +1.56 (+1.56)

The king of retailers is back! Wal-Mart is the leading
discount retailer in the world, with a presence in all 50
states, as well as Canada, Mexico, Asia, Latin America, and
Europe. In addition to discount department stores, it
operates the #2 grocery chain, behind Kroger's, and Sam's
clubs, which is the #2 warehouse chain. This retail giant's
market capitalization is $182.3 billion.

We covered Wal-Mart recently, but dropped it when the stock
began pulling back. It appears to be moving out of a
consolidation phase and has been trending up for a week, with
only one slightly down day in that period. Wal-Mart had a
strong holiday season. It continues to grow at home and also
abroad, partly through acquisitions. It is now growing its
profits faster than its sales once again.

As an option play, WMT is a steady mover. While it lacks the
fast moves of the technology and Internet stocks, it is a
safer play, and has the added advantage of being a split
candidate. The stock last split in February 1993. Its last
three splits occurred when WMT traded in the mid-60s.
Earnings are due out in February.

COMBINATION PLAYS   - Split-O-Rama
*****************************************************

Monday, January 25

U.S. blue-chip stocks ended higher Monday after a volatile day of
trading amid a slew of mixed earnings results from multi-national
companies. The DJIA closed unofficially up 82 points at 9203.32.
The Dow shed 57 points early in the day but recovered as several
big-name companies including AT&T and 3M reported earnings. The
high-flying Nasdaq Index gained 30 points to 2369.11 primarily on
the shoulders of Microsoft shares after the company declared a 2:1
stock split. A report that analysts expect IBM to announce a stock
split after its board meets Tuesday helped Big-Blue reverse a $6
loss from early in the day and close slightly higher at $180.93.
Despite big gains in the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite, breadth on
both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq was negative as
decliners outpaced advancers on both exchanges.

Most of the Sunday plays were available near the recommended entry
points. MRK opened the day around $137 and traded slightly higher
just before 10 AM. The first prices listed for the FEB160C/155C
bear-call spread were around $0.75 credit. EMC was also slow to
start trading and opened slightly higher near $100. Our put-credit
spread; FEB75P/80P did not have any volume but the bid/ask quotes
were within $0.12 of our target entry of $0.50. SKYT was a pair of
plays; the calendar spread, JUN25C/FEB25C was easily opened for
$2.38 debit. The best we saw on the ITM debit spread, FEB22C/25C
was $2.00 (higher than our target) and that was a little slim on
the ROI potential so we decided to pass. PLCM fell hard in a post
earnings dip but that just brought the sold position nearer to ATM
and a higher time component. We decided to take advantage of the
lower entry price; $0.87 for the MAR25C/FEB25C time spread, and
hope the stock finishes around $25 in four weeks. NRC was very
interesting as the option quotes opened near the previous closing
prices but soon moved apart in the spread (MAR50C/FEB50C) even
though the stock price remained quiet and the volume was fairly
docile. Our initial price was $1.12. CNTO, the butterfly spread,
moved lower most of the day reducing our initial entry to $0.87
for the FEB35C/40C/45C position. Remember, there is a method of
legging out of a butterfly spread that is acceptable. If the
stock price moves significantly, early in the life of the
spread, the BULL spread portion or the BEAR spread portion can
be closed-out near their maximum profit potentials. The spreader
may want to take advantage of this situation in order to profit
more if the stock reverses direction and comes back into the
profit range. By increasing his risk slightly, he may be able to
improve his position significantly by converting the butterfly
spread to a vertical spread. Although the chances of such a trend
reversal cannot be considered great, it does not cost the trader
much to restructure himself into a position with a much broader
maximum profit. That's our plan, we'll see what happens...

In other portfolio activities; PCS just keeps climbing like there
is no gravity and we just wonder where it will end. If any of you
are exercised early on the short side of the spread, let us know.
SRCM is a source of pain as the stock price has fallen sharply
without any change in the buying pressure. We decided to pull the
plug and prevent any losses. The JAN17P was closed at $1.25 and
we would expect to sell the JAN15P at a minimum of $0.50 for a
break-even exit. The initial target will be $1.00 until the stock
reverses (upward) again.

Tuesday, January 26

On Tuesday, U.S. stocks rallied in afternoon trading to close near
session highs. Solid earnings reports, stock splits, and big tech
deals all boosted the market. The DJIA closed unofficially up 115
points at 9318.40. The Nasdaq index of technology issues finished
up almost 65 points at 2433.46, surpassing a record high close of
2415.49 set on January 20th. Big gains in shares of IBM, Xerox,
Microsoft and Yahoo accounted for much of the positive movement.

On Tuesday, our big movers were AOL, CPQ, LVLT and SUNW. AOL was
the only issue we acted on, closing half of our debit position at
$2.25 for a $0.75 profit. On the LVLT debit spread, we expect to
close at about a $6.50 credit for a $2.00 profit. SRCM continued
downward but did not reach our target exit for the FEB15P. Watch
for signs of a turn-around as the buying pressure is still very
healthy on this stock. PCS just keeps climbing, about 6 days in a
row. MRK had a surprise rebound today, climbing $6 on a positive
earnings announcement. More to discuss on Thursday...
******************************************************************
    - NEW PLAYS -

Today we will focus on some of the common stocks in the blue-chip
technology group. We rarely play these issues because the main
section of the newsletter covers these stocks in-depth and we like
to bring you a wide array of candidates. These companies are in
the news everyday and the earnings/split-mania is just too much to
pass up...Good Luck!
******************************************************************
MSFT - Microsoft  $171.56     *** Disparity? ***

Microsoft Corp. develops, manufactures, licenses and supports a
range of software products, including scalable operating systems,
server applications, business and productivity applications,
software development tools and Internet software and technologies.

Microsoft rules! With a market value that far outstrips its sales,
Microsoft is the world's #1 software company. Softwares include
Windows, Excel, MS Word, PowerPoint, and Encarta. The Microsoft
Network provides online content, and its Internet Explorer is
still battling Netscape Navigator for market share. With NBC, the
company operates cable news channel MSNBC. They also provide email
with "Hotmail" and many other services.

Everybody is making deals with MSFT. To make AltaVista a premier
destination site on the Web, Compaq announced a partnership with
Microsoft in which AltaVista will offer a e-mail service based on
Microsoft's Hotmail service. In addition, AltaVista and Microsoft
agreed to make AltaVista's Web search the primary search vehicle
for the Microsoft Network Internet site.

The big news (of course) was the blow-out earnings and the 2:1
stock-split. On Monday, Microsoft said its stock split would
increase its shares outstanding to 5 billion and make its stock
more affordable. The split will take effect on 3/12/98 if it is
approved by shareholders.

We expect MSFT will consolidate somewhat after the news wears off
but there is no doubt it will return to the headlines shortly
thereafter. Sell the time premium now before it evaporates in
this small disparity play.

PLAY (conservative):

BUY  PUT MAR-155 OI=686  A=$4.00
SELL PUT MAR-160 OI=3842 B=$5.38
NET CREDIT TARGET=$1.50 ROI=42% (2 months)

Chart = http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=MSFT&d=3m
******************************************************************
DELL - Dell Computer  $88.50     *** Almost Free Money ***

Dell Computer is one of the world's top PC makers and the world's
#1 direct-sale computer vendor. The company sells hardware and
markets third-party software and peripherals. Products include
notebooks, PCs, and network servers. Dell also markets a variety
of peripherals and software for other manufacturers. More than 90%
of its systems are sold to businesses and government entities. The
company continues to expand services such as its Web site, which
is expected to process half of it's transactions by the year 2000.

Dell recently announced that they have secured a share of the #1
position in the worldwide personal workstation market. They also
continue as the number one vendor for customer satisfaction and
their scores are significantly higher than most competitors in
price/performance, overall reliability, repair and delivery time.

Dell will post earnings sometime in mid-February and we expect
the stock to make the traditional run to the actual announcement.
In addition to buying calls, you might elect to make this play
with current portfolio collateral. This is a low return spread
based on another small disparity but the worst that could happen
is you choose to own DELL at $69.19.

PLAY (very conservative):

BUY  PUT MAR-65 DLQ-OM OI=766  A=$1.19
SELL PUT MAR-70 DLQ-ON OI=2341 B=$1.81
NET CREDIT TARGET=$0.81 ROI=19%

Chart = http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=DELL&d=3m
******************************************************************
XRX - Xerox Corp.  $116.31     *** Split Play ***

Xerox engages in worldwide development, marketing, manufacturing,
financing and servicing of document processing products.

This week, Xerox delivered another record quarter, reflecting
strong double-digit earnings growth consistent with company
objectives, even though pre-currency revenue growth was clearly
affected by some weaker economies. Their fourth quarter diluted
earnings per share increased 16% to $1.69 and income increased
17% to $615 million, primarily as a result of outstanding growth
in digital product revenues, improved operating margins and
ongoing benefits from the worldwide restructuring program. Xerox
also announced an 11% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on
the company's common stock and a two-for-one stock split.

The stock split will be effective for shareholders of record on
2/4/99 and distributed on 2/23/98. The quarterly dividend will
increase 11% to 20 cents on a post-split basis, payable on 4/1/98
to shareholders of record on March 5. Today's gap-up and the
split date make perfect timing for a one month spread. Plan to
close the play near the February strike date on the pre-split run.

BUY  CALL MAR-120 XRX-CD OI=40   A=$7.12
SELL CALL FEB-120 XRX-BD OI=1487 B=$3.75
NET DEBIT TARGET=$3.12 TARGET ROI=25%

Chart = http://quote.yahoo.com/q?s=XRX&d=3m
******************************************************************
IBM - Intl. Business Machines  $185.50     *** Split Play ***

International Business Machines is the world's top provider of
computer hardware and it is #2 in software. The company makes a
broad range of computers, including PCs, mainframes, and network
servers. The company also makes software and peripherals, and has
an ever-expanding service arm. IBM owns software pioneer Lotus
Development, maker of the Lotus Notes messaging system. Almost 60%
of the company's sales are to foreign customers and IBM continues
to revamp its image, with a focus on Internet business.

As expected, IBM declared a two-for-one stock split, just one day
after software rival Microsoft did the same. IBM posted fourth
quarter earnings last week that exceeded street expectations but
saw its shares fall after failing to announce a split. Today, the
stock rebounded on the renewed interest. The new shares should be
distributed on or about May 26 to shareholders of record on May 10.
The IBM board also set a regular quarterly dividend of $0.22 per
share, payable March 10 to stockholders of record on Feb. 10.

Although the current technical (and earnings) outlook is somewhat
lackluster, we believe Big-Blue will rise to the occasion and
easily hold $185 on the strike date in March.

PLAY (conservative/debit spread):

BUY  CALL MAR-175 IBM-CO OI=513 A=$19.25
SELL CALL MAR-185 IBM-CQ OI=649 B=$13.00
NET DEBIT TARGET=$6.00 ROI(max)=66% B/E=$181.00

		 Subject: Warrant Based Swaps

Based upon discussions with Andrea Reed, the res of the swap will be the 
warrant itself, not the underlying stock.  The warrants are valued separately 
with a "warrant model" and carry a price of their own differentiated from, 
although affected by, the stock price.  I did not get into further detail on 
the specifics of the modeling.  The will provide us the number of warrants, 
the strike price as of August 3.  Otherwise they will work similarly to the 
stock based swap I think.  She said they do not plan to exercise them, but 
may sell them as warrants.  Let me know what you think.  Mary

		 Subject: "Thin" Computer  Flat Screen

Please order me a flat screen computer.  Can I also have a printer?  It will 
save me lots of time,  MaryJohn - While we can delete Part 6 it then becomes necessary to add additional 
language in each confirmation which is not part of the templates for 
transactions used by the back office.  Each transaction would therefore 
require significant additional time and effort to prepare making it more 
cumbersome to do business with that counterparty.  There is no down-side to 
having the language in the master - the whole point of the master is that we 
agree to these things now so we don't have to deal with them at the confirm 
stage.  You can say "it's enough if the terms are referred to in the 
confirmation" for ALL of the terms of the master.  Since we would insist on 
the appropriate provisions being in the confirm in any event, if they have a 
problem with this language we need to know now what the problem is.  With 
respect to the CSA, that is an issue for Credit.  It is certainly not 
necessary to have a valid agreement but it is necessary if you want to insist 
on collateral.  In this case, if IBJ is a stronger credit than Enron it may 
well be that the csa is more of a burden than a benefit.  It strikes me as 
disingenuous to say that they don't have the internal systems for csa's with 
nonfinancial counterparties - the same systems would work for nonfinancial 
parties as well as financial parties.

Dear Mr.Viverito

Thank you very much.
Now we start checking your draft and maybe we can return comment on this
Friday.

Please be advised following points at this time.
1)Part 6 on the schedule is needed to be deleted.
  We think that it's enough if the terms in Part 6 are referred in the
individual confirmation.
2)ISDA Credit support annex is not acceptable
  Unfortunately, we don't have internal system for concluding CSA with
non-financial entity.

Please keep support us for concluding ISDA ASAP for our business in near
future.
If any question, please feel free to contact me.

Dear Mr.Viverito

Attached Word file is ISDA draft amended by our legal desk.
(please take the amended points as our comment on your draft)
Please check it all and kindly reply ASAP.
(CSA is not acceptable as I mentioned you before, and we'll check your
LETTER OF CREDIT after
the schedule is almost agreed)

In your draft, we cannot understand the meaning of "EDGAR" on page4,
so please show us what it is.

We are very hoping to conclude this process rapidly.
So, I very much appreciate it if you could send back your comment before
Holiday in U.S.(4th Sep)
(it's ok if only the rough prospects of concluding ISDA)

Best regards,

would think we need to be careful to avoid any appearance of impropriety.

Subject: CFTC Chair -- possible nominee

The leading candidate to replace Brooksley Born as CFTC Chair seems to be 
Annette Nazareth (sp?), who is currently at the SEC.  She is a former Wall 
Street lawyer with a good knowledge of the capital markets/derivatives 
business, and others in the industry feel she would be sympathetic to our 
views on regulation of the OTC markets.   She apparantly has the backing of 
the White House and Treasury Department, and she fits the most important 
criteria -- she's willing to take the job.

As she emerges more formally as the nominee, we might think about an Enron or 
Energy Coalition meeting with Ms. Nazareth her to educate her to the 
specifics of our business.  I'll keep you posted on the process.

Jeff

Yes, Mary is still in 3807.  Is the printer you mentioned the 
smallest/cheapest one we can get?It's not looking good for getting back to you today on this - shaping up to 
be a very bad day and we need to coordinate with Credit for their responses 
as well.  I have a call in to John Suttle and have forwarded the revised 
draft to him.  We'll do what we can.

I saw your reply to my previous note.  On this one point:

It strikes me as disingenuous to say that they don't have the internal 
systems for csa's with nonfinancial counterparties - the same systems would 
work for nonfinancial parties as well as financial parties.  IBJ is the most 
sophisticated Japanese player in the derivative market and one would believe 
that they could handle the documentation for both financial and non-financial 
entities.  I note, I have heard that it is not market practice for Japanese 
financial institutions to provide collateral to non-financial institutions, 
so it may be very difficult for them to alter their position. 

I understand.  My view is just that it is probably not a systems issue but a 
position and it irks me to have the point made as a systems issue when it is 
not.  As we both agree, the  issue may be moot depending on what Credit 
thinks.FYI

Enron IT PurchasingI've chartered in the BVI a number of times and it is a great place to take 
beginners.  I only caught your post of yesterday so didn't see the earlier 
thread.  I'm assuming you're picking up the boat in Road Town or nearby.  The 
only problem with getting away from the dock by 12 or so is if the boat isn't 
quite ready.  I've always used the Moorings so they're the only outfit I 
know.  They don't usually let you get started on the boat until after the 
chart briefing which means you don't go aboard until 10.  If you use their 
provisioning service it eases that chore but sometimes the food isn't there 
right on time.  Having several people (but not too many) around this time is 
helpful to put food away, take inventory, attend boat briefing, etc.  Of 
course, if you get the boat the day before - maybe with a sleepaboard option 
or some such, you have that much more certainty that everything will be done 
on time.  Check with your charter company about attending the briefings 
before sending the last person off to the airport - some companies may 
require 2 people from your boat to attend.

As for first day - if you are away by 1 I suggest heading over to the Bight 
on Norman Island.  There are lots of moorings there and you'll get one as 
long as you're not in too late.  It shouldn't take more than a few hours to 
get there and if it looks like it might be close you can always fire up the 
engine.  There are a couple of places (a beach bar and a boat) to eat and 
drink there if you don't feel like cooking the first night and although you 
can't call it deserted or even secluded because of the number of boats there, 
there is at least very little ashore to bother you.  The caves are just 
around the corner and the Indians right outside for great snorkeling/diving 
either that afternoon or first thing the next day.

Whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise doesn't really matter.  My 
advice running roughly clockwise: 

skip Soppers Hole - just a commercial port with little of interest (unless 
you're clearing customs); 

skip the USVI - all the clearing out & in & out & in can take a lot of time 
and there's plenty to do in the BVI - if you just have to go, the northern 
shore of St. John is the best - nice anchorages (several of the 'secluded' 
variety) without the crime on St. Thomas and the resort at Caneel Bay will 
let you come ashore for a fancy dinner (but make reservations and leave your 
trash on board - there's nowhere to put it); 

Jost van Dyke is fun - anchor in Great Harbor or pick up a mooring in Little 
Harbor - Sydney's Peace & Love restaurant in Little Harbor still has an honor 
bar where you mix your own drinks & just keep track in his little black book 
while you're waiting for dinner, Foxie's in Great Harbor is a classic beach 
bar/rest. - lots of fun and good food & drinks;  

Sandy Cay is everyone's image of a desert island and perfect for a lunch stop 
and a swim; 

don't miss Cane Garden Bay (unless the northerly swell is too heavy) there's 
a wonderful swath of pure white beach with palm trees swaying overhead and 
steel drum bands serenade you into the evening - watch the reefs but the 
channel in is well marked; 

if there's a full moon be sure to be on Tortola somewhere that night (Cane 
Garden works fine) to get to Bomba's Shack for the party - there are lots of 
taxis there as the evening progresses to get you back; 

it's easy to pick people up (or drop them off) at the airport (close to the 
water with a dinghy dock) midweek if you need to and kind of fun to be met 
that way; 

the Baths are a must but VERY crowded (no anchoring allowed - must use a 
mooring) so I'd try to get there as early in the day as possible (Cooper 
Island, Marina Cay and area by Last Resort are nearby for the night before) - 
maybe get up early, motor or sail over and have breakfast once you're safely 
moored - and be careful to use the right color mooring and avoid the ones 
reserved for commercial craft;  

I usually skip Spanish Town (Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor) since I'd rather be 
at anchor than stuck in a marina slip with no breeze, but if you stay there 
you can get a taxi to the Baths and top off with water in case your crew is 
not serious enough about fresh water conservation (and what crew ever is?); 

the Bitter End is great for a long hot shower (I think you pay at the resort 
front desk) and maybe a 'fancy' dinner and there is also a water dock there 
(10 cents a gal.?).   

Sometimes it seems like the distances are so short you don't get to sail 
enough - you shouldn't have any trouble getting a lot in (but you won't be 
able to see everything).  The only difficulty might be if you need to get the 
boat back in for an early flight but I've let people out at Cane Garden Bay 
to take a taxi to the early flight & then sailed around to have the boat back 
well before noon.  Having said that, I suggest Cooper Island or the Bight for 
your last night - it just makes that last morning a bit more leisurely.   And 
just as I mentioned for the first night, it makes sense to get into most 
anchorages early rather than late so you're sure to get a mooring (in those 
that have them) and don't have to worry about finding a spot for the boat - 
many of them can get quite crowded.  Of course, if you're going anytime 
between now and Thanksgiving there shouldn't be any trouble with crowds - 
just pay daily, close attention to the weather forecasts!

Don't expect much in the way of night life but there are places to eat at 
nearly every anchorage - many are closed in the low season.  A few of the 
islands have some good hiking but there's not much for the sight seers 
either.  But snorkeling and diving are everywhere.  Ask at your chart 
briefing for the best spots these days.  If you have divers along, don't miss 
the wreck of the Rhone - you can have a dive boat come and meet you there and 
bring along equipment and a guide for the divers.  The cruising guide will 
have lots of info on all these issues.

Wish I was going - it's always a blast!

I sent Amanda & Bill an e-mail a couple of weeks ago and here is Bill's 
reply.  I sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things 
and which were the best times of year, etc.  I haven't heard anything from 
Amanda and was beginning to assume they were not really interested in a 
November trip.  Have you heard anything firm from Virginia?  Bill's 
next-to-last paragraph tells me that he's getting to know Amanda - but I 
don't think she'll leave him alone for the holiday.  The real question is 
whether her uncanny ability will extend to his schedule, too.  If they still 
want to go we'd better make travel plans soon - that Thanksgiving Sunday is 
notoriously difficult to get seats.  If you'd rather wait until Jan. or Feb. 
that's fine with me too.  Just let me know.

Hey Mark, nice to hear from you.  I am glad you enjoyed the wedding.  It went
by so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time.  Apart from a few
travel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular.  Tahiti is a true
paradise.

I am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem is
that my honeymoon has put me firmly in "vacation deficit" at the SEC.
Barring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough days
available by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean.  Amanda has
told me how much fun it is and I want to do it but I may need to find another
time.  I'll check into it and let you guys know definitively very soon.  How
long to you go for?

Keep in mind though that I do not speak for Amanda.  She has an uncanny
ability to arrange her schedule so that she can participate in virtually
every vacation idea that people bring up.

I'll be in touch,  Bill.     I have no idea since I never read the original - I just thought it was an 
interesting approach to take when making a modification.

I'm not sure why that shouldn't count.  Any trades done can be booked into 
RMT and then into ECT if necessary to hedge with third parties.I don't think I have any problems with this presentation - but can you give 
me an idea of the proposed audience?Wow - too many choices.  Let's see, the day of the week charters start and 
end is not fixed - except that the boat has to be available on the days you 
want it.  We usually went Sunday to Sunday so we could get 2 weekends in and 
use the Saturday as a day to fly down.  It's much harder to get there from 
Houston than NYC (fewer flights) so it pretty much takes all day to get 
there.  The 3rd - 8th is a Friday through  Wed. - not optimal from the 
weekend point of view but doable I suppose  - it just means a 4 day instead 
of 7 day charter.  If you want to wait until Thanksgiving we could certainly 
manage with the 2 of us - particularly if we got one of the smaller boats - 
and it might make sense to go back to the BVI where we know the sailing won't 
be all that challenging (I hear the St. Martin area can get rougher).  Plan B 
sounds like fun too - and then we could all go together later (it seems mean 
to go without Bill) - New Years sounds like a blast to me!  What would you 
think about heading down the Friday or Saturday before (12/29 or 30) and 
spending the first week of January there?  That assumes Bill can get that 
week off and Amanda doesn't have to be back in school til later.  I have a 
couple of sailing friends here that might like to go then too if you're 
interested in a slightly larger  group.  They're a lot of fun, good cooks and 
reasonable sailors  too!

Amanda has a break from Nov 3-8th  ( and I don't think she has classes on 
Friday anyway).  Is that something the three of us can work with?  
Alternatively, do you think the two of us could manage over Thanksgiving - 
with amanda joining for the long weekend (fly down Thurs eve and back Mon).  
I can't remember what day of the week charters begin and end. - is it set in 
stone?   Plan B - we could met at the Greenbriar or DC for Thanksgiving.  I 
understand from Amanda that Bill is not going anywhere until 2001.  Of course 
that does make New Year's eve a possibility.  If all else fails, I did hear 
from Greg this week and he wants to know if we are still sailing.   And I am

Mark: 

Implementation of the EOL project in Brazil had been postponed for a while 
because of regulatory matters. The Market Rules were still being discussed 
and had not been approved by ANEEL, making it impossible for us to implement 
EOL, from a regulatory standpoint. Recently (about a couple of weeks ago), 
ANEEL issued Resolution 290/00, approving the Market Rules, subject to 
certain amendments. The amendments will be implemented in stages over the 
course of the next few years. After Resolution 290 was issued and the 
regulatory issues were partially resolved, the EOL team decided to work on 
the project again. I am now in the course of adapting the ETA, GTC and 
Password Application for use in Brazil. I will probably have drafts for 
comments within the next 10 days. I am not sure about the time estimate for 
completion of the project as a whole. I believe Remi can give you a better 
idea of the schedule.

I will forward to you in a separate e-mail the legal opinion that we received 
from outside counsel, addressing the issues in the memo prepared by your 
team. Also, I take the opportunity to let you know that I am leaving Enron by 
the end of August. From September on, the contact people for the EOL project

In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I can be of any further

First choice: New Years if Bill & Amanda can get the first week of 2001 off. 
Second choice: Another time (I guess in 2001) when everybody can be there.
Third choice: The week of Thanksgiving.
I guess I would prefer not to go for a long weekend because it takes me so 
long to get there, although the Thanksgiving weekend is pretty long & might 
work if nothing else does.

I sent an e-mail to Amanda to sound out her views.  My guess is that she will 
want to go several times.  Her usual response to a choice is to avoid it.

Since lots of things might work, do you have any preferences/choices.  Are 
you committed to an entire week?  Want to shorten it to a long weekend (or is 
the travel to much of a pain for you).I don't think there is any plan that 
will include Bill in 2000.  If we include Amanda, I think it is either Nov 
3-8 or it is Thanksgiving.  We could do a long weekend on either of those 
dates or if you want to take the whole week off, you and I could go for the 
week and Amanda could join us for part of it.  I don't know how much time you 
want to spend on this venture.  Do you want to wait until 2001?  Give me some 
idea what is your first, second, third choice.  And of course you can choose 
more than one ( I am sure Amanda will).

Wow - too many choices.  Let's see, the day of the week charters start and
end is not fixed - except that the boat has to be available on the days you
want it.  We usually went Sunday to Sunday so we could get 2 weekends in
and use the Saturday as a day to fly down.  It's much harder to get there
from Houston than NYC (fewer flights) so it pretty much takes all day to
get there.  The 3rd - 8th is a Friday through  Wed. - not optimal from the
weekend point of view but doable I suppose  - it just means a 4 day instead
of 7 day charter.  If you want to wait until Thanksgiving we could
certainly manage with the 2 of us - particularly if we got one of the
smaller boats - and it might make sense to go back to the BVI where we know
the sailing won't be all that challenging (I hear the St. Martin area can
get rougher).  Plan B sounds like fun too - and then we could all go
together later (it seems mean to go without Bill) - New Years sounds like a
blast to me!  What would you think about heading down the Friday or
Saturday before (12/29 or 30) and spending the first week of January there?
That assumes Bill can get that week off and Amanda doesn't have to be back
in school til later.  I have a couple of sailing friends here that might
like to go then too if you're interested in a slightly larger  group.
They're a lot of fun, good cooks and reasonable sailors  too!

Amanda has a break from Nov 3-8th  ( and I don't think she has classes on
Friday anyway).  Is that something the three of us can work with?
Alternatively, do you think the two of us could manage over Thanksgiving -
with amanda joining for the long weekend (fly down Thurs eve and back Mon).
I can't remember what day of the week charters begin and end. - is it set
in stone?   Plan B - we could met at the Greenbriar or DC for Thanksgiving.
I understand from Amanda that Bill is not going anywhere until 2001.  Of
course that does make New Year's eve a possibility.  If all else fails, I
did hear from Greg this week and he wants to know if we are still sailing.
And I am still looking for something to do over Christmas.

I sent Amanda & Bill an e-mail a couple of weeks ago and here is Bill's
reply.
I sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things and
which
were the best times of year, etc.  I haven't heard anything from Amanda and
was
beginning to assume they were not really interested in a November trip.
Have
you heard anything firm from Virginia?  Bill's next-to-last paragraph tells
me
that he's getting to know Amanda - but I don't think she'll leave him alone
for
the holiday.  The real question is whether her uncanny ability will extend
to
his schedule, too.  If they still want to go we'd better make travel plans
soon
- that Thanksgiving Sunday is notoriously difficult to get seats.  If you'd
rather wait until Jan. or Feb. that's fine with me too.  Just let me know.

Hey Mark, nice to hear from you.  I am glad you enjoyed the wedding.  It
went
by so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time.  Apart from a
few
travel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular.  Tahiti is a
true
paradise.

I am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem is
that my honeymoon has put me firmly in "vacation deficit" at the SEC.
Barring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough days
available by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean.  Amanda has
told me how much fun it is and I want to do it but I may need to find
another
time.  I'll check into it and let you guys know definitively very soon.
How
long to you go for?

Keep in mind though that I do not speak for Amanda.  She has an uncanny
ability to arrange her schedule so that she can participate in virtually
every vacation idea that people bring up.

I'll be in touch,  Bill.

Congratulations on your promotion!  Well deserved and long overdue. I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle (Credit) and it=
=20
looks like he's going to insist on the CSA.  We are going to talk tomorrow=
=20
and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While =
we=20
have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20
master agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many=
=20
of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have=20
trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be=
=20
helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a=20
mark-up.

Following are my points responsive to their revisions:

Part 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the=
=20
possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for=20
example, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy=
=20
this agreement would be in default).

(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk=
=20
to the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=
=20
reason to remove it.

Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells=
=20
out exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar=
e=20
not acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=
=20
agree we will put it in the agreement.

Part 4 (f)  By deleting the word "not" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=
t=20
payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=
t=20
(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=
=20
make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=
ne=20
payment).  This is not acceptable.

(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=
NA.

Part 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20
receive payments due even though technically in default under another=20
provision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20
possible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=
=20
honored.

(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=
=20
city.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=
ot=20
impossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20

(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=
t=20
have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=
=20
as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20
practice.

(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=
o=20
multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=
=20
IBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=
=20
trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=
=20
will never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like=
=20
to restrict ourselves that way.

(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If=
=20
there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu=
t=20
wholesale deletion is out of the question.

(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while=
=20
maintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency=
=20
with which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is=
=20
important to us.

(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha=
t=20
went into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. =
=20
We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o=
ur=20
revision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe=
r=20
high rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate i=
s=20
more appropriate.

(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20
protects us both.

(n)  You know more about this than I.

Part 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20
individually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisio=
ns=20
are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a=
=20
significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)=
=20
and we need to know now if they object to any of them.

Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  =
I=20
hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discus=
s=20
any of these issues at greater length if you want.  It sounds to me like=20
IBJ's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given th=
e=20
volume and nature of their comments.

Dear Mr.Viverito

Attached Word file is ISDA draft amended by our legal desk.
(please take the amended points as our comment on your draft)
Please check it all and kindly reply ASAP.
(CSA is not acceptable as I mentioned you before, and we'll check your
LETTER OF CREDIT after
the schedule is almost agreed)

In your draft, we cannot understand the meaning of "EDGAR" on page4,
so please show us what it is.

We are very hoping to conclude this process rapidly.
So, I very much appreciate it if you could send back your comment before
Holiday in U.S.(4th Sep)
(it's ok if only the rough prospects of concluding ISDA)

I am not concerned about the issues below because a) is no longer a feature 
of the game and b) we are only showing a small portion of the flags, and this 
seems to be fairly academic.

Please let me know if you feel these are issues that need to be addressed.

Subject: Enron Online Game


Dear All

Two issues/questions have been brought to my attention.  These relate to the
demo of the game I was sent a while back (i.e. a "Five Flags Down Under"
demo) and may therefore have been superceded (or the impact lessened) by
events.

a)  Under the "edit groups" section in the demo contetstants are told  "want
to have your own private Unamed Contest for friends, colleagues or
co-workers?  you can! it is simply a matter of choosing a group name,
entering a group password and telling your fellow contestants to go to this
page to join etc"

I assume that since fellow group members need to register, the "friends,
colleagues and co-workers" are all actually employees of Enron customers
anyway i.e. they can register in their own right if they want to?  Is this
the case?  If it is the case, perhaps it should be made a bit clearer that
an employee of an Enron customer can't  include friends who don't work for
Enron customers in their group.

b) Our Intellectual Property department have  "flagged" (excuse the pun!)
the issue of using national flags in a commercial setting.  Use of the UK
flag wouldn't seem to create problems - there is no copyright in the flag
because it is over 200 years old and it is widely used on, for example,
T-shirts as decoration.  However, they believe that there might be issues
associated with using the US flag -  this flag doesn't, for example,
routinely appear as a decoration on T-shirts etc.

Is this something that has already been thought of and dismissed in the US?

We believe that, in practice, national governments might not take action to
prevent the use of their flags in/on commercial products, as long as the use
is in good taste.  In addition, we believe that copyright provisions in
flags are normally only enforceable within those particular countries.
Flags are usually restricted under international copyright law from being
registered as trade marks, but consent can be obtained to waive these
restrictions, so there is a possibility that particular national flags could
be registered trade marks.

Given the particular circumstances of the game i.e. the flags are being used
in "good taste", for a limited audience, for a limited time,  and Enron is
presumably not seeking to obtain an unfair advantage from using the
reputation of the flags, problems do not seem particularly likely.   My
sense is tha,t if the use of flags is thought a "non-issue" in the US, then
it is probably even more of a "non-issue"/less of an issue  in Europe, but
if you would like me to take this further/check with the various EU
jurisdictions, please let me know?

Thanks

Rachel

Good catch.  NY law should apply throughout the Americas and in Japan.  We 
used UK law in Europe and Singapore on the theory the counterparties there 
would be more comfortable with Uk law.  I'm not sure which the Australians

		 Subject: Quick Update


The legislation continues to move ahead.  The current schedule seeks to have 
the bill completed in the House next week and voted on the floor the week of 
the 18th.  That leaves two weeks for the Senate to act before a recess around 
October 6.  We have been working hard to push the House Commerce Committee 
version of the bill which exempts all physical commodities (other than ags) 
traded bilaterally or through an electronic trading facility from most CFTC 
jurisdiction.

Negotiations between the SEC and CFTC on single stock futures are ongoing.  
That issue represents the largest open area for resolution but both the 
participants and Congress are optimistic that it can be worked out.  We need 
to continue to work hard to persuade the members to follow the Commerce 
Committee approach.  We will keep you apprised.

Subject: Re: DAPSA  

The originators here occasionally come across a counterparty who wants to do 
a financial trade.  They discuss generally what ECT can offer and if the 
customer wants to do a deal they are told to contact Hector Ramirez in 
Houston who actually does the trade directly with the customer.  Neither EI 
Argentina nor any employee from this office should be mentioned in any 
document going to the customer since we are not technically involved in the 
trade.   As a relationship issue our people here are anxious to make sure the 
documentation and confirmation of trades goes smoothly.  There may be a 
finders fee paid by ECT to EI for customers directed to ECT depending on 
various factors which I am not privy to.  I hope this helps.

If you find a decent tickler program let me know.


To: Brent Hendry/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT @ ECT

Subject: DAPSA

I have resolved the Consent to Service of Process with CT Corporation and Mr. 
Blaquier and am going to send Mr. Blaquier the originals tonight for 
execution.  I don't know how to handle the check, he suggested dropping it 
off at your office.  I think I'm just going to have him include it back in 
the package to me and then send it on to CT along with their form.  CT will 
then issue a letter to DAPSA reflecting their acceptance of their role.  We 
need to get a copy of the letter that Mr. Blaquier receives, and then we're 
covered.

This will be renewed on an annual basis, with CT directly sending the bill to 
DAPSA.  If they do not receive a renewal check within a month they will 
cancel their agency relationship.  So, somehow, we need to followup on this 
on an annual basis.  Unfortunately, we do not have a tickler system to remind 
us annually to do something.  I'm going to talk to Mary Solomson, they have a 
tickler in Global Contracts and I'm going to see if we can get it added to 
it.  I can see this falling through the cracks.  Any suggestions?

One other thing, at the Legal/Credit meeting we discussed the DAPSA agreement 
and I was quizzed as to who the business people were and they only ones I 
know of are in Argentina, and won't that cause ECT to have a presence in 
Argentina if we transact the trades down there?  How is that going to work?  
Are the trades going to be entered into from Houston?  Can you let me know so 
I can report back.

Much thanks!

Mark, I would like to attend an ENA orientation put on by the Development 
Center on the morning of Oct. 4 (that's the Wednesday before the Woodlands 
conference -- it doesn't conflict with the conference, but it would conflict 
with our bi-weekly swaps group meeting that week).

The orientation is simply an introduction to the various ENA departments 
(trading, origination, structured finance, etc.) and how they interact.  It 
sounds very basic but I think it would be very helpful to me -- especially in 
the Chinese wall context.  

I don't know whether there will be a charge to the department for this, but I 
can find out if you want.  Please let me know your thoughts -- thanks, Bob

You have received a new fax from 02075797778

Just FYI, I think the EnronOnline decision was to leave the User ID off of 
the Password Application as a security measure.  The User ID is sent 
separately (I think in a security envelope) so that the User ID and password 
are never written down in the same place.  And of course the system requires 
that the password be changed the first time the new user logs on so the Enron 
file copy of the PA won't give access to a user's valid password.

Tom:

The EOL Password Application form used to develop the CommodityLogic Password 
Application, except as set forth below, is identical to the latest version of 
the EOL available on the EOL website (N.A. Version 2, June 9, 2000). Mark 
also gave me a hard copy of the current EOL Application to compare.

The only difference is that Todd or Leslie, I believe, added a section for a 
"Required Initial User ID" number right above the "Required Initial Password" 
section. I do not know if we need the User ID Section any more. Todd, could 
you check with the EOL folks (Dale Neuner/Frank Davis) to determine the 
answer, and revert back so we can make a final decision for CL. Thanks.

Finally, attached is a revised version of the Password Application for CL 
that changes the reference at the bottom to "CommodityLogic LLC"  to "Enron 
Networks LLC" as CL is not yet a legal entity.  Tom, have any decisions been 
made with respect to that issue?

Hi guys,

Louise was concerned that CommodityLogic might not have borrowed the latest 
edition of EOL documents for use on the CommodityLogic website.  Could I 
please ask you two to ensure that we are using the latest legal stuff.  I am 
not sure who actually holds the definitive copy of the latest EOL legal 
docs...

Thanks very much,

Tom





Approved.

Amanda,

Thanks for your note.  It looks to me like the schedule breaks down as 
follows:

Possible Date: October 12 - 15
My Reaction: I will be speaking at a conference in Sedona, AZ (not known for 
its great sailing)

Possible Date: November 3 - 8
My Reaction: I have another speaking engagement in NYC right after that 
(makes it sub-optimal for me) plus Bill can't go

Possible Date: Thanksgiving
My Reaction: You guys can't make it

Possible Date: New Years (travel Sat. 12/30, pick up boat 12/31, back in the 
office Mon. 1/8/01)
My Reaction: Everybody can go - and since Monday is a holiday only 4 vacation 
days used for a full week of sailing - Perfect in every way (if we can get 
flights and a boat - I haven't checked this yet)

Possible Date: Later in 2001
My Reaction: Works for me but I hate to put it off so long

So my preference is to try for New Years and fall back on early November as a 
second choice.  If you want to go for less than a week now and a full week in 
2001 when Bill can go we can do that, too.  What are you guys thinking?  
Since we won't be going at Thanksgiving, how are you going to talk your mom 
into dealing with the holiday?

What happened to Brazil? Did Intel or Yahoo buy it?


From the 180 degree change in market sentiment we had today you
would think that Brazil was taken over by an Internet stock.
The Intel split announcement and the Yahoo announcement of it's
takeover of GeoCities energized the market and revitalized the
tech sector. Brazil was hardly even mentioned in the days news
after they reported on the maturity date changes before the
market opened.

On top of the blooming optimism at the open Alan Greenspan
actually blessed the Internet sector during a testimony in
Washington. He said basically that he thought investors were
viewing Internet stocks as "lottery ticket" plays were the
odds were much better. He pointed out that analysis of future
earnings and growth was actually culling the good plays from
the bad ones. He said that historically investors often buy
on faith companies that they anticipate to do well before any
actual earnings exist and the Internet sector is no different.

When you consider that there are 68,000 new Internet surfers
coming online every day it just makes sense that the only
five year old Internet will continue to grow at an exponential
rate. With that user growth the leaders will quickly amass
larger audiences while the smaller less efficient providers
will either fall by the wayside or be taken over. Free enterprise
is a wonderful thing and tends to continually prune itself of
excesses and reward hard work and innovation. Enough preaching
but did you know that of the 31 analysts that follow AOL, 28
either recommend a buy or strong buy, even at these prices!!

The Nasdaq was the clear winner again today, setting a new
closing high. The leaders were the four horsemen, MSFT +5.38,
INTC +4.44, DELL +5.38, CSCO +5.44. Most of the Internets
were up double digits again and show no signs of stopping.
I would remind you that Internets have been weak on Fridays
of late as traders take profits from the week.

The Dow was led today by the same stocks that took it down
yesterday. JPM +4.31, C +1.69, T +4.63, MO +2.25, GE +1.94.

Contrary to news hype the Dow traded in exactly the same range
as it traded yesterday only without the end of day drop.
The 9250-9300 range only provided a positive day today due
to the -70 drop at the close yesterday. The market did not
"get well" over night. It just recovered from the spike
caused by two sell programs at the close. Check out a chart!

I really hate to keep coming back to this but the advance/decline
ratio only barely broke even today. The NYSE adv/decl 1552/1423
was only positive by 129 and the Nasdaq 2067/1933 was positive
by 134. This is definitely not a major move and not a major
reversal of the down trend. This could be the start of a new
uptrend but the proof is in Friday's numbers.

I got some hate mail for being somewhat cautious (bearish) in
last nights commentary. When the market had fallen from a +90
high to only +30 at 2:30 this afternoon I was really worried
that the caution was justified and it looked like we could
close negative for the day. I don't feel like a word of
caution after a bad day is particularly bearish but until
Brazil resolves it's problems I believe it bears watching.
When your life savings is invested in the market it is sheer
stupidity not to watch anything that can cause problems. You
would not ignore a rattlesnake in your closet just because
you can't see it today. Eventually it will come out and
probably when you least expect it.

Friday is a wildcard. Futures are up +2.00 and it looks
bullet proof but I know Murphy's law is alive and well.
About the only thing you can count on for tomorrow is more
volatility. It would not surprise me to see techs suffer
from profit taking. Whenever a stock is up double digits
for the week it is a prime candidate.

Good Luck

Jim Brown

Posture Alert

A positive showing from the equity market has firmed the
bullish bias driven by M&A activity, decent earnings results,
favorable economic data, and a stock split from AOL and
Intel.  After advancing and closing into record territory, we
have turned Bullish across the Retail.  We caution investors,
however, that the current rally has been driven by a few
blue-chip companies and that several key industry sectors are
still trading at or below their 50-day moving averages including
Banking, Insurance, Airlines and Oil & Gas.

Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
******************************************************
Percent Bearish Below 30%

According to Investors Intelligence readings, the percentage of
those who are bearish is now only 28.2%.  Investors Intelligence
publishes the percentage of newsletter writers who are "Bullish"
or "bearish" on a weekly basis.  When pessimism evaporates, the
market may be nearly a correction. This is significant because
such a low number of bears suggests that much of the available
capital is ALREADY invested and very little remains to fuel
additional market advances.

Just by way of benchmark, the percent of "bears" back on July 17,
1998 clocked in at 23.3% - just days before the start of a major
sell-off.

Other sentiment indicators are still flashing BEARISH
overtones over the near-term so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.

The Power of Expectation Analysis

It has often been said that the crowd is right during the
market trends but wrong at both ends.  Measuring and
evaluating the sentiment of the crowd, therefore, can give
savvy option traders a decided edge.

PICKS WE DROPPED
****************
When we drop a pick it doesn't mean we are recommending a sell
on that play. Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.
We drop a pick because something happened to change its
profile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we
don't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.
We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are
unfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we
want them to look at any current pick as a valid play.

PICK NEWS - CALLS
*******************************************************
EMC $106.88 +5.06 (+8.38) EMC set a new high today and closed
near the high.  The positive press just continues to roll in.
There was an article by The Motely Fool yesterday that is worth
reading if you trade EMC.  Some of the highlights of the
article are that EMC's market share in the data storage market
has grown from 28% to 32% while IBM's has decreased from 24% to
20%.  The Internet and E-commerce should continue to drive
EMC's sales, as 8 of the 10 largest Internet service providers
already use EMC storage systems.  Also in the news today,
Gruntal & Co. started coverage on EMC with a buy rating.

ORCL $53.69 +2.69 (+3.81) ORCL set a new high today, and closed
slightly below its old high.  In the news, ORCL's Japanese
subsidiary priced it initial public offering today.  It is
expected to be one of Japan's hottest IPOs in many months.
Like many US IPOs, it is expected to soar on the day of its
debut.  ORCL's ownership in the company will fall from 91% to
85% after the public offering.  The other news item that is
probably helping ORCL a little is Informix, the No. 5 maker of
database software, announced better than expected earnings.
(which is likely to raise expectations for ORCL).

UTX $116.94 +1.06 (+2.38) UTX set a new 52 week high at $118.75
after the open on Wednesday, and has traded down since then.
As we have said on numerous occasions, with the lack of news,
UTX will mirror the Dow.  In fact, if you look at its daily
chart from today you will see what we mean.  UTX took a dip
shortly after noon and recovered towards the close.  We haven't
had any news on UTX, but the Street did like the announcement
last week about UTX deciding to sell its underperforming
automotive unit.

MU $75.13 +3.63 (+4.63) Micron was off slightly yesterday, but
today it gapped up at the open and kept on going.  We said on
Tuesday that while Micron's current quarter ends in February,
and earnings won't be released until sometime in March, the
stock will react to any news on other chip stocks in the
meantime.  Most of the sector is in the middle of earnings
releases.  A 2-for-1 stock split by chip sector leader Intel
can only be positive for the other chip stocks.  Look for MU
to continue moving higher in sympathy.

NOKA $152.75 +7.50 (+8.19) Nokia saw a nice jump in its stock
price today ahead of tomorrow morning's earnings report. If
you sold this afternoon, you locked in your profits and you
can jump back in tomorrow if the numbers look good and/or
they announce a split.  Those who held over should note that
earnings will be reported before the NYSE opening bell, so the
stock will gap up or down accordingly.  Rival Ericsson just
reported strong earnings and received an upgrade.  Nokia has
been looking even stronger than Ericsson in recent months, so
we are hoping for big news in the morning.

WMT $85.44 +.25 (+3.44) The King of retailers is back to its
old ways--a slow but steady climb in price, which is why we
picked them up again. WMT is sitting just below the intra-day
high it set on Tuesday of $85.94, which is it's only resistance.
WMT had a 389,000 share block trade Wednesday at $84.00. This
is both a momentum play and a split candidate (which we would
expect with earnings).

BBY $90.44 +1.81 (+11.19) Best Buy keeps powering ever higher,
today setting a new intra-day high of $91.94. BBY seems to have
found a successful retail formula, and they sell what consumers
want most these days: technology products. Everything is
increasing for this company: total number of stores, same store
sales, market share, profit margins, and stock price. Higher
selling and administrative costs also showed up on their last
quarterly report, but they were part of an effort to improve
performance and increase volume. The only thing that declined
was their interest expense, and that is very positive. Sales
for most of the holiday period will show up in the current
quarter, so there is probably still good news yet to come.

DELL Computer $94.19 +5.69 (+11.19)  We often note that
volume is critical to sustained price moves, and bemoan
Dell a bit on its lighter volume.  Fortunately, trading
volume swelled yesterday and today to 23 million and 21
million shares, respectively; average is 17.5 million.
Dell traded flat yesterday, but was up $5.69 today to a new
all-time high.  There is still room to run as Dell blasted
through resistance with no immediate end in site.  Protect
your profits with stops and confirm direction first before
playing. Earnings are scheduled after the close, February
16.

CSCO - Cisco Systems $108.88 +5.48 (+6.07)  Cisco was
wholloped yesterday into the $103 range, but made it all
back, and then some, today on strong volume.  NASDAQ is on
a tear with CSCO as the 3rd highest weighted stock in the
NASDAQ 100.  Market willing, expect further advances into
earnings.  CSCO is also a split candidate with enough
shares authorized to announce a 3:2 split along with
earnings scheduled for release on February 2.  The run has
begun.  Dips are buyable.  Confirm upward movement first
and use stops to protect your profits.

AOL - America Online $174.75 +9.25 (+34.27)  Same league as
Microsoft.  AOL announced $0.17 earnings yesterday, $0.03
better than estimates, and a 2:1 stock split (effective
February 22).  Volume swelled to almost 20 million shares,
both yesterday and today, sending AOL into orbit.  Buying
pressure is still on as AOL closed at a new all-time high.
Resistance is weak at $176, its all-time trading high set
today just before the close.  AOL's new target price is
$210 and now occupies a top 10 position in the Fidelity
Magellan Fund.  With so much profit built in, remember to
use stops.  Dips are buyable.  Market permitting, the sky
is the limit.

WCOM - MCIWorldCom $79.88 +2.31 (+5.00)  Here we are again;
WCOM just can't seem to break resistance at $80.  Market
willing, it looks like we'll get another chance to crack it
tomorrow.  Wait for penetration of $80 with strong volume
before making a play.  Still benefiting from Supreme Court
ruling against the Baby Bells, WCOM is rumored to soon be
announcing the start of a new consumer Internet service,
different from UUNET, its business ISP.  In its acquisition
of MCI, WCOM was required to shed its consumer ISP
division, Cable and Wireless, in order to gain Federal
approval for the merger.  Dips are buyable, but wait for a
clear reversal.

MSFT - Microsoft $174.00 +5.38 (+17.75)  A nice surprise,
MSFT still wants to run following it's stellar earnings and
Monday's 2:1 split announcement (effective 3/26),
contingent upon shareholder approval.  We expected a
pullback, but not as small as the one we got.  After losing
less than $3 yesterday, MSFT closed today at a new all-time
high, just $0.06 off its highest trade on 53% higher than
average volume -- extremely bullish.  If the market
continues up, MSFT will too since they are the largest
component of the NASDAQ 100.  As always, confirm market
direction first [don't forget to use stops]

DH - Dayton Hudson $63.06 +0.06 (+3.12)  Slow and steady;
that's the way the parent company of Target Stores moves.
Volume was a little light today -- only 1.3 million shares
traded.  Yesterday, DH gave us a nice $2+ pop on 2 million
shares (2 million average).  70,000 shares traded at the
close yesterday at a price of $63, lending some support at
this price.  No news this week.  Look for small rises to
continue if the market cooperates.  1189 institutions own
89.5% of the 395 million shares in float leaving about 40
million shares in daily float to trade.  Translation:  not
many sellers; extra volume will tend to goose the price.
Dips are buyable on a reversal.  DH is a more conservative
play.

ANF $73.00 -0.75 (+3.25)  After the $4.19 run it made on
Monday and Tuesday, ANF was due for some profit taking.
Wednesday, it lost $0.19 to humor us.  Thursday, ANF
teeter-tottered back and forth between green and red for most
of the day but then finally decided to finish negative.
ANF seems to be consolidating before resuming its course.
Just to be sure, wait for ANF to show upward movement again
before initiating new positions.

SEPR $111.75 +9.50 (+12.25)  Geez, when we initiated coverage
of this pharmaceutical company on Tuesday, we planned on
seeing the stock gradually increase.  Instead, the stock
pleasantly surprised us by spiking up +$11.25 during Thursday
trading.  It even broke above the new 12 month price target
of $112 set by BancBoston Robertson just last Friday.  However,
it couldn't hold on and finished the day at $111.75.  The
uphill spurt may in part be due to news of improved sales of
Eli Lilly's depression drug named Prozac.  Lilly and Sepracor
are currently working on an improved version of Prozac (which
loses its patent protection sometime after 2001).  Set your
stop losses tight to prepare for any subsequent profit taking.

I have just received the letter SFA promised us.  SFA have accepted our 
argument that our proprietary bond and equity trading can be carried on in 
London through an unregulated UK entity.  The letter also states that SFA 
will not be applying their consolidated capital supervision rules to the 
unregulated entity, which they have the discretion to do.

From a regulatory perspective this means we can move ahead at full speed to 
set up an appropriate Chinese Wall and then begin trading.

I thought I might try to sum up.  It seems to me that we both need to 
finalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that 
we all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of 
next week.

1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap 
structure including the credit and covenant package.

2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have 
one prepared.  Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global 
Finance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its 
external counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements, 
documents, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or 
exchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among 
each other and we are therefore working at cross purposes.  Frankly, unless 
and until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and 
financial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations 
are, it is difficult if not  impossible to prepare documentation.  For 
example:

 (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee 
they were expecting from Enron Corp.  I was trying to require the Bank to 
accept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking 
for a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and 
warranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities.  Based upon 
this disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may 
have a problem to resolve.  However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by 
voice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a 
long form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact 
been provided (by whom I'm not sure) to the Bank.

 (b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the 
Enron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law.  However, I 
now understand there may be some agreement (by whom I'm not sure) to have the 
Enron Corp. Guarantee governed by New York law.

 (c) In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of 
enforceability opinion from Enron Corp.'s outside legal counsel with respect 
to the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron 
Corp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect 
to the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas/New York) being enforceable.

 (d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to 
me that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to 
Enron Canada.  Blake, Cassels & Graydon is prepared to provide those legal 
opinions.

 (e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of 
the underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine.  I 
suggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable.

 (f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the 
Bank's external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of 
Swapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed.

 (g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this 
afternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank.  This 
presents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps 
involving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults.  At 
the same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be 
capable of being set-off.  We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation 
through broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements.

 (h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on 
the credit/collateralization/margin requirements, which I think is dependent 
upon a final understanding of the swap structure.

 (i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not 
clear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap 
structure.  Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the 
principal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate 
"fee letter" to recover its fees.  More problematically, the Bank was not 
clear as to how "increased costs" would be accounted for in the swap 
structure.  Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions 
that if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a 
change in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those 
increased costs are flowed through.  They were not sure how this could be 
accommodated in a swap structure.  I suggested that there may be some way to 
fix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes 
or through a separate indemnification in the "fee letter".

 (j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the 
paper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank.  For 
example, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements 
and related documentation (which I believe Mark T's group will prepare in 
Houston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I've indicated above seems to have 
already been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs 
to be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels & 
Graydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the 
Bank in connection with the transaction.  Of course this depends on 
finalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants 
package.  In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, 
that the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same 
as the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank 
of Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper 
as soon as possible.  Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon 
as possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning.

Frankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a 
measure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external 
expectations.  It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all 
relevant groups (i.e. Legal/Global Finance/Credit/Origination) on Monday 
morning.

*******************************************************

SUNW $109.31 +3.88 (+11.31) SUNW is having an incredible week.
On Monday and Tuesday it jumped $8.62.  Profit taking and
weakened markets set Sun back only -$1.19 on Wednesday.  On
Thursday, SUN heated up again and added $3.88 to finish just
off its high for the day.  Merrill Lynch raised its price
target to $130 and maintained its buy rating on the company.
In the news recently, Sun Microsystems, Lucent, Cisco, and
Network Associates have joined forces to form the Security
Research Alliance.  This Alliance will be committed to
helping organizations increase the security of their
desktops and networks.   Look for SUNW to head higher if
the markets can stay the color of money.

VIA.B $85.00 +2.13 (+2.44)  After profit taking took its toll
on the stock on Tuesday, VIA.B turned it right around.  It has
steam rolled ahead another +$2.88 since Wednesday.  Some more
articles have surfaced on the topic of VIA.B's earnings due
on February 25th.  The consensus seems to be that they will
be better than last year's loss of 29 cents a share.  One of
SG Cowen & Co's analysts thinks they could come in at +0.16
a share.  Some of Viacom's productions have been popular with
viewers.  The movie "Varsity Blues" and the TV programs
"Becker" and "Dilbert" are all getting nice ratings.  Watch
for VIA.B to keep up its forward progress.

WAG $60.25 +1.13 (+1.81)  WAG took advantage of the volatility
in the markets on Thursday and added +$1.31.  Walgreen's is
looking good and if the markets can positive, look for WAG's
uptrend to continue.  It is splitting it's stock 2:1 on
Feb. 12th.

LXK $110.31 +1.00 (+11.06) LXK continues to be a strong
performer.  A gain of $1.00 today in a good market is one
thing, but a gain of $1.13 on Wednesday was very impressive.
For the last three trading days LXK has reached an intraday
high.  The new high is now $111.88.  We still see a stock
split in LXK's future, but at this time a probable date is
not known.  Most likely an announcement would come as a
result of a special board of directors meeting.  We'll keep
you updated.

VOD $197.63 +4.00 (+10.25) VOD had a great day on Thursday.
For the 4th time in 5 days, VOD closed at its high of the
day.  The merger between ATI and VOD is still a go and to
insure the tax-free status of the merger, ATI has filed for
a private-letter ruling.  This is a ruling the IRS gives
ATI to insure the tax-free status of the merger.  Both
companies feel that even if a private letter ruling isn't
given in the positive, they can achieve the status they
desire.  This issue has been part of the cause for the
discrepancy of the offer and the current prices.

XIRC $45.00 +1.13 (+3.00) XIRC continues to move upward.  One
bullish sign on Thursday was the push and hold above the
prior high of $44.50.  We are in new high territory and see
no reason, other than profit taking, that should keep this
stock from heading higher.  No recent news on XIRC, but
the stock has outperformed the communications industry at
a nice margin over the last couple of weeks.  XIRC's PE
ratio is also lower than the industry average.

SNC $40.25 +.69 (+2.50) SNC continued to rise today, reaching
an intraday high of $40.63.  SNC is still $12 below its 52-
week high.  With a PE ratio below the industry average, SNC
still has room to move toward prior highs.  Earnings are in
a few weeks and, market permitting, should see an earnings
run.  The last 7 earning surprises have been: 4,9,11,6,15,33,
and 14%.

XLNX $83.50 +3.69 (+5.32) XLNX has been on a yo-yo the last
week or so.  The bottom line is that XLNX is yo-yoing its way
up.  On Wednesday, XLNX fell just under $3, but came back
strong with a gain of $3.69 on Thursday.  Even with all the
day up and day down movement, XLNX is still up over $5 on the
week.  With the stock split not until March, we are likely
to see times of consolidation.  This most likely occur when
the NASDAQ itself decides to rest.  Watch for pullbacks.
XLNX's CEO did state that the past quarter earnings did exceed
expectations.  This should lead to a nice continued uptrend.

are sold in over 90 countries in addition to the United States.

CLX has been on a nice roll since its earnings announcement

above prior resistance at the $117.  CLX today announced that
it's buyout and merger with First Brands has been approved by
First Brands shareholders and will officially take place on
Friday the 29th.  This news went over well with CLX investors
as CLX traded as high as $124.38.  Profit taking could take
place on Friday, but pullbacks could be nice buying
opportunities.

The major news dealing with CLX of late has been the earnings
announcement and the merger with First Brands.  CLX also
announced recently a $.36 dividend.  CLX is a large company

CVC - Cablevision Systems Corp. $70.50 +2.63 (+7.62 for the week)

Like its name suggests, Cablevision Systems Corporation is a
cable company.  It has approximately three million subscribers
concentrated mostly in the northeast.  Through its subsidiary
Rainbow Media Holdings, CVC owns cable channels like American
Movie Classics, Bravo, and the Independent Film Channel.  It

Cablevision is a steady mover.  Since mid-December it has
climbed $28 and it shows no signs of slowing down.  CVC is
up +$7.62 this week alone and has shown strength under the
recent rocky and stable market conditions alike.  On Monday
Jan 25th, Merrill Lynch raised its price target for the stock
to $85 a share which should only help the stock.  Earnings
reports are due for the company on February 18th.  We are
looking for Cablevision Systems to continue its well
established uptrend.

COMBINATION PLAYS
*****************************************************
The Bull's continue to run...

Stocks moved lower Wednesday as nervous investors braced for the
testimony on the economy by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. The main
focus of the Thursday meeting could be the current high level of
stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 124
points at at 9,200. Technology stocks, the stalwart group in many
recent sessions despite softer prices in most other sectors of the
market, also faded and this despite a good morning session put in
by the Internet issues. The performance of the broader market has
also been a sore spot among market technicians for quite some time
and Wednesday's poor showing only added fuel to those concerns.

Our Tuesday plays were a raucious group. MSFT opened higher with
most of the technology stocks but eventually it fell back and just
a little patience allowed traders to achieve the suggested credit
of $1.50 for the (MAR155P/160P) bull-put spread. DELL was also
higher in the morning and some of you had to wait until a few
minutes after 10 AM for the correct entry price of $0.81 on the
MAR65P/70P credit spread. XRX was stable most of the day and the
the calendar position (MAR120C/FEB120C) was available more than
once at $2.87 debit and the lowest I saw was $2.75. IBM was the
big mover and although we expected a pull-back, $7 was a bit much.
We started the play (MAR175C/185C debit spread) with a reduced
entry price of $5.50 but by the end of the day the spread was down
to $4.50 so we decided to double-up, reducing our overall position
to a nice round number. Those of you playing the spread could
easily better our position, but that doesn't mean it won't fall
further tomorrow. Eventually, we think IBM will make the split run
to the $180-$190 range...Lets hope so!

BGP appears destined to fall well short of our long position in
February. After this week, we will no longer track the calendar
spread and just be thankful that the debit spread had a positive
outcome. SRCM continued lower but did not reach our target exit.
The goal is still $1.00 for the FEB15P but with time running out,
we make take the small profit soon. The JMED straddle started to
show some activity the last few days. Any continued downward
movement may help us exit the bearish side of the play shortly.

Thursday, January 28

U.S. stocks rallied Thursday as Internet mania propelled the tech
issues. Two mergers AOL's positive earnings helped the market move
higher. Yahoo!'s planned purchase of GeoCities and Intel's stock
split drove investors to a buying frenzy in the technology arena.
The incredible performance by the technology sector lifted broad
market averages to hearty gains in the process. The DJIA ended up
81 points at 9281.33. But the Nasdaq composite index was again the
story of the day, rising 70 points to a record 2477.33. Observers
continued to express concern over the deficient breadth of the
market's advance of late, but most weren't ready to turn outright
negative on U.S. shares and Greenspan may have put the icing on
the cake when he said that Internet stocks, despite their high
valuations, might have their place in the bull market.

AOL, CTXS, DELL, EMC and SEPR were our big movers and even IBM
finished positive. LVLT is now approaching the exit target but
SRCM continued to hang-on with today's rally. Stocks that are
approaching downside limits include RDRT and SCUR. We will keep
a close eye on these plays. Shares of Centocor climbed past $44
after the company said fourth-quarter profit rose to 14 cents a
share before charges, exceeding the average estimate of analysts.
For those of you interested in the butterfly roll-out, today's
move allowed an easy exit from the bullish part of the spread;
APR35C/45C for a credit of $3.50. Now the plan would require the
stock price to fall enough so that the APR45C/40C can be bought
for less than $2.62 (the current cost basis). Butterfly spreads
are an excellent neutral strategy and they have more flexibility
than a straddle.

INTC - Intel $137.19     *** More Splits ***

INTC designs, manufactures and markets microcomputer components
and related products at various levels of integration. INTC's
principal components consist of silicon-based semiconductors
etched with complex patterns of transistors. With about 85% of
the microprocessor market, Intel is definitely inside. Its chips
have been providing the brains for IBM-compatible PCs since 1981.
The company also makes computer flash memory; microcontrollers;
and networking, communications, and graphics products. Intel
continues to expand and upgrade its products and facilities to
maintain its dominance over rival chip makers such as Cyrix and
Advanced Micro Devices.

Intel is the most recent of several high tech companies that have
announced stock splits this month, including Microsoft, IBM, Sun
Microsystems, eBay and Yahoo. In a move widely anticipated by
financial analysts, they announced a 2-for-1 stock split to make
shares more affordable to investors. The split takes effect 4/11
and that gives us plenty of time for the stock to recover from
any short-term pullback. There should be a dip in tomorrow's
trading to help you improve the opening position.

DST - DST Systems  $61.62     *** Technicals Only ***

DST Systems provides information processing services and computer
software products and services to mutual funds (it has about 30%
of the market), insurance providers, and banks. Clients include
Janus Capital and T. Rowe Price Corp. DST's Emerging Business unit
consists of Argus Health Systems (prescription claims processing)
and DBS Systems Corp. (cable television subscriber-mgmt. software).

In 1998 DST, Boston EquiServe, and First Chicago Trust teamed up
to form EquiServe, a provider of corporate stock transfers, the
largest company of its kind in the US. The company has operations
worldwide and about 16% of its sales are outside the US.

Earnings are due soon but they are expected to be inline with most

WLP - Wellpoint Health Network  $72.62     *** Technicals Only ***

WellPoint Health Networks, the #2 health insurer in California
serves about 30 million members nationally through HMOs, PPOs, and
specialty networks such as dental and mental health plans. The
company operates as Blue Cross of California in its home state,
where some two-thirds of its medical care members reside, and as
UNICARE elsewhere. WellPoint also sells life insurance through
subsidiary WellPoint Life Insurance and workers' compensation
services through subsidiary UNICARE Financial. The company is a
care contractor for Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, and
provides third-party administration for self-insured companies.

With most losses accounted for in earlier quarters and a clear
sense of costs, HMOs are expected to post fourth quarter gains
in line with Wall Street's expectations. However, even with an
extremely positive report,(Wellpoint is expected to report an 18%
jump in earnings) the recent chart history reflects a somewhat
disappointing outlook. We think it will easily finish below the
sold strike in February.

Aspen Technology builds computer systems that assist process

Companies such as Chevron, Dow Chemical, Procter & Gamble, and

of production and management. The company, which has facilities in

product line through acquisitions of smaller firms with similar
simulation and modeling technologies.

On Wednesday, they reported favorable quarterly earnings, a very

Just wanted to mention to you that if either Louise Kitchens, Andy Zipper or 
Mark Haedicke are interested in participating in the Energy Bar program but 
is not yet in a position to make a firm commitment, we can list the speaker 
as "invited" for the first mailing and then make any corrections that are 
necessary on a subsequent mailing that will be distributed.? Of course, the

authorization.? Would it be possible to get back to me today on an

Mark Haedicke are interested in participating in the Energy Bar program but 
is not yet in a position to make a firm commitment, we can list the speaker 
as "invited" for the first mailing and then make any corrections that are 
necessary on a subsequent mailing that will be distributed.? Of course, the 
Bar Association would not list a speaker as "invited" without prior 
authorization.? Would it be possible to get back to me today on an 
EnronOnline speaker?? Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule 
to provide assistance.

Steve

Mark, 

I am not sure if you had a chance to contact Louise Kitchens or Andy Zipper 
regarding the Energy Bar Association program, but I just wanted to check.? If 
neither of them are available, has Mark Haedicke returned from travel?? If 
so, would you recommend that I give him a call.

I know that you are very busy and greatly appreciate your assistance.

As the office construction process continues, your offices will be among the 
next to be demolished & reconstructed.  While the current timetable is not 
firm, it looks like your moves will be scheduled sometime between the 5th to 
the 13th of October (this means the move may take place during the ENA 
offsite).  I just wanted to give you as much warning as possible so you could 
begin the packing process.  Joya Davis will have details of your new (in some 
cases temporary) office locations, can help with obtaining boxes and will 
schedule the actual move.Your new offices will be ready in a week or so.  We anticipate your moves 
will take place over the weekend of September 29.  Joy Davis will coordinate 
your moves and can help with obtaining boxes, etc.  Sorry - forgot to cc you on this one.

If you look at the attached list we are due to make a lot of these dates in 
the next two weeks.  The biggest problem in Europe is probably that Edmund is 
obviously out of the office and there are no dates even for his.

These delays are causing chicken and egg problems with the metals customers.  
We can't mail if there are no pas etc.  The big metals roll-out is in London 
first week in October so we do need them by then,

If there are re-prioritisation issues please contact Bruce Garner who needs 
them for that week.

Please let me know. 

Thanks

Louise

SOME RECENT EMAILS
***************************************************************

First of all let me say that you have the best advisory service
I have ever seen, bar none.  You truly have an UNCANNY knack for
picking winning options.  About 8 of 10 of my recent plays have
been very profitable.  Of particular note, selling puts on the
bank stocks early one day netted about 400-500% gain on a trade
I closed out THE SAME DAY!  Thanks K.W.
*****

Just wanted you to know that the special update tonight is
appreciated and provides good insight. After a while one gets 
tired of the TV commentaries regarding disaster..disaster..disaster.
Thanks - Allan B.
*****

I seldom burst into print, but I feel the need to congratulate
you on an excellent newsletter supplemented often with very
welcome alerts.

I have been a subscriber for several months. I couldn't do
without your market views and the excellent background
information you give us on stock picks. Your humor is also a
great relief when the so-called experts have a different slant
or warning every time the slightest change occurs in the economy
or politics.

With very best wishes, Jack W.

I know ya'll must take a ton of grief daily, but I really
appreciate the job that you do.  You, alone, have tripled my
portfolio in my two week trial period.  Thanks for your insight!

you a line to tell you how much i appreciate your insight into
the market. you do an excellent job at trying to find good
trends in a volatile climate. don't get discouraged over the
last few days. it is hard to find value in a market that
probably needs to catch its breath. i really look forward to
your next letter. good luck!
very truly yours, dan

Hello Jim,

I still love the newsletter.  After not following my plan a
few times due to lack of discipline, my account suffered.
But now, I have been winning the "discipline battle" the
last 6 trades and my account is at an all-time high.
Thanks. Trey
*****

Jim, Thank you for your news letter.  I have always traded options,
but never with the confidence and success that I have since I
subscribed.  I have turned $5,000.00 into over $42,500.00 in three
weeks!  AOL and CSCO have been great. Keep up the great work.

Sincerely, Andrew

You guys are the best. No only do you help us make some bucks

how do you pick so many good stocks?

Jim,  this is the first email I have sent to any newsletter and

some gains for the first time ever. Thanks for the good work. Kumar

I just wanted to let you know you have done a great job for me.
I have made $10,000 profit in just one week!!  AOL, CMGI, YHOO,

I have traded about 20 calls, and YTD annual ROI about

*****

Once again, I just want to say how much I enjoy the newsletter.
You and your team do an outstanding job. I also subscribe to
other newsletters such as McMillan's "Option Strategist", so I
appreciate quality when I see it. Your newsletter is first rate!

Thanks, David
*****

Your newsletter is the best I have ever received.  Over the
past two years I have spent hundreds of dollars on newsletters.
This is by far the best and the only one I have made money from.
I am so excited about your newsletter that I am telling lots of
friends.  I also think you give conservative advise that I
appreciate.  I am very conservative and it has taken me two
years to realize that I could do options.  With your help I have
already been successful in one week!  We own lots of Dell stock
but the options are even more fun to watch go up.  I also follow
WLA, GPS, and CSCO very closely.  We also own those stocks.
Options make a lot of sense to me when I'm familiar with the
stocks and know how they act.  I guess earnings season is also
a very good time to own options.  I am nervous about doing
options after the earnings season.   Claudia
*****

The Option Investor has been an enormous help in my budding
trading career.  In fact, it is the first source of information
I've bought (and I've spent thousands on books, workshops, and
other website subscriptions)where I can demonstrate a direct
and nearly immediate link between the information and actual
financial success in trading.

More importantly than this perhaps is your forthright statement
about the importance of what I would call maintaining the
integrity of the relationship between you and your customers.
You are clearly a "straight shooter", and this is as apparent
in the no nonsense approach you are taking to the website
cheating problem as it is in the advice you provide in the
newsletter. Bruce
*****

I cannot tell you how much I support you in your actions.
The people who abuse the system are not only taking advantage
of you, but of all of us who are willing to pay the VERY
reasonable amount for what we get.  The return on my investment
has been several hundred times over the amount I give you
and personally I thank you for taking these steps.

Thank you, Lloyd

Jim: I want to thank you and compliment your service.  Please
feel free to post my unsolicited remarks below as a reference
to your Newsletter Service.
     Thanks for the followup on the Japan market sentiment.
It's great to know that when there is a big market event you
are on top of things for us.  I subscribed a few weeks ago and
want to say that I am most satisfied with the newsletter.
     I was experienced with stocks and options before I subscribed,
but I was kind of "trading in the dark," with a lack of self-
confidence in my strategies.  Now with the newsletter, I found
that I was pursuing the right strategies but didn't have the
confidence and trading skills to perform good executions.  The
confidence gained through the Option Investor Newsletter and the
time saved in searching for opportunities (great opportunity plays
already summarized by the newsletter) has helped me focus on "better
execution."  My results have improved dramatically.  Since early
June when I started the two-week-trial, my option brokerage account
net worth has increase from $20,000 to $70,000 today.  I also
believe that I am trading a lot smarter, actually incurring much
less risk than before.

Thanks, Tony

Dear James: I would like to take a moment to thank you for the
job that you and the Option Investor staff do.  I am sure we
(subscribers) don't know half of what you guys must contend
with day in and day out to get the newletter to us.  However,
do know that you are appreciated.

    I must readily admit that I am totally addicted.  I look
forward to Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday nights.  I am like a
child at Christmas time.  When I first subscribed to your
newsletter I was somewhat unfamiliar with your format and
recommendations.   I would pick half hazardly and not plan my
execution strategy.  However, as I sat back and analyzed your
picks, paper traded for sometime, I then started actual trading.
I went from a negative portfolio to a positive within 3 weeks,
all the credit going to you guys!  I am still attempting to
concur the art of letting the profits run (I still tend to get
out a little too quick), but I am better at stopping out when
the trade hasn't gone as expected.

    Keep up the good work and I look forward to a long lasting
relationship.

Thank you, Darrel

Jim:
    I just had to write you to tell you that during my first
two week free trial, your information made me $2,000 from a
$2,000 investment! Needless to say, I subscribed and since then
the website has made me an additional $2,500. All of this in less
than 30 days! I have been to Wade's WIN site free for a week
and your information is much easier to understand and use. I
haven't been this excited in years! Your site has literally
changed my life!
Steve

I am just a lame rookie with options, but I profited nicely
($15K) in one week with one trade per your news letter, and it
was not from an Internet stock! I would have profited greater
from another transaction if I would have heeded "pigs get fat ,
hogs get slaughtered". I have more of your suggested options in
the works and am cautiously looking for similar returns! Thanks
for the great information. cb

HI, I have to tell you that "WE LOVE YOU GUYS"  Our life revolves
around Sun., Tue., and Thur. Thoughts, comments.  I know you work
hard to get the information out and you do a great job.

Thanks for everything,

Hello Jim, Thanks so much for the valuable information!

I have been trading stocks for many years, the last year I dug
myself an incredible hole, by investing in small caps.

I just started trading options with the encouragement, help and
guidance of your newsletter. I was able to recapture my 30 K loss
in three weeks!  and my Schwab account is back in  positive territory!

This is incredible! I am comfortable now with option trading,
using the stop loss and diversification principle coupled with
good research your suggested 'method'  works!

Thanks for the advise on the books too!   V.R.

I got my first issue of your FREE two week trial and I can only

I took your Sunday recommendations and decided to find out the
results if one were to simply follow your suggestions without any
analysis of their own...

As of Wednesday... over 63% of your calls were in positive
territory with an overall gain of about 80%...
IN 2 DAYS....OUTSTANDING!!!!

This really excites me because I have some extensive knowledge in
technical analysis, so when I filter your recommendations with the
charts, I should come up with about as close as "SURE THING" trades
as I will probably ever get! :)

Thanks for the research and the recommendations... keep it up!

Dear Jim, Your trading rules saved me last week.  I've traded
options for years but my success has been twarted by not knowing
when to get out, staying too long, getting greedy, hoping it would
go back up, etc.

Well, a trade went the wrong way last week and normally I would have
hung on but you say so often, "If it goes down, sell it" that it
must have finally sunk in.  Though it was down by 5 for the day,
I got out with only losing the previous day's gain thanks to "The
Rules".

I love your site and newsletter. Thanks again.  BB

Dear Jim:

Yours is the best I have seen bar none.  I just signed up last
week after my free trial.  I find your letter friendly and chatty,
but not condescending, as some others I won't mention.  And not
too technical!  Without trying to impress, you have done so.

Thanks so much for COF, and CSCO, both of which returned excellent
results for me.  I can't show you a new Jaguar yet, but I think you
will make me much richer. Don H.

Dear Sirs, I've been VERY impressed with your service!  You do
excellent stock and market evaluations.  Your suggested plays are
obviously predominantly on target.  Your tutoring and explanations
of your thinking behind your suggestions are so clear and well
expressed ...AND APPRECIATED.
NOTHING else I've come across has helped me more in learning how
to go about trading options!  And you've helped me fine tune my
approach to stocks as well.

Thanks and keep up the good work!   Ann

Hey!

Nice call on Cisco! I bought is at 2.75 as you suggested and
sold yesterday at 5 each, for a nice total return of about 80%.

Thanks!   Nelson
*****

Please charge my credit card for a quarterly subscription.
Thanks. I was about to give up on options having lost over
$3000 on my own. With your trial I was able to make that back.

Cordially, John

Jim and Crew:

I found your site by bouncing around the Internet and have been
impressed with the results you folks get. Much to my wonder here
was a special alert on Tuesday that just blew me away!
When I saw that the email was sent at 4am. I was super impressed.
Your crew had been at this all night!
I played your recommendations (bought 10 of everything -- no not
really) and made money while having a really great time.

I have tried many of the other services that are out there for
option traders BUT NO ONE has the results, refreshing commentary,
and right-on picks that your team does.

I am pleased to tell you that I am now and dues paying subscriber
and happy to be in your hands -- please keep up the good work.

Mark --

Rick Shapiro has asked that I coordinate with you on CFTC issues since I'll 
be handling government affairs matters for Enron Global Markets and Enron 
Networks.    

Would it be possible to meet sometime this week (or early next week) to talk 
about this?   I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday of this week, and 
all of next week.   Let me know what works for you.

Looking forward to meeting you.

LisaSheri -

I don't remember being consulted about sending these documents by e-mail (but 
that doesn't mean it didn't happen - just that I don't remember it).  It 
sounds like a valid concern - any reason we can't just send people to the web 
site and ask them to print out the relevant PA?

		 Subject: EnronOnline PAs

Mark -
Now that my responsibilities have been increased to include both EnronOnline 
and Clickpaper, something was brought to my attention that I am concerned 
about.  Clickpaper has been instructed not to send password applications to 
customers via e-mail.  This is something we have been doing since the 
inception of EnronOnline.  The concern is that customers will alter the 
language in the agreement, sign  and return it to us - hopefully, this will 
not happen, but could be a valid concern.  I am hoping you can shed some 
light on the original decision that was made to allow sending the PAs to 
customers electronically.  One solution that we could implement in the future 
is to send the file to the customer in .pdf format; however, the customer 
will need the applicable software to launch the program (we could include a 
link to download this).  The immediate solution is to discontinue this 
practice until I have discussed it with you.  I know you are out of the 
office until Monday, and I am out the rest of the week as well.  Please let 
me know your thoughts when you return.

Thanks!

At a recent computer expo (COMDEX), Bill Gates
reportedly compared the
computer industry with the auto industry and stated
"if GM had kept up
with the technology like the computer industry has, we
would all be
driving $25 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon."

In response to Bill's comments, General Motors issued
a press release
stating: If GM had developed technology like
Microsoft, we would all be
driving cars with the following characteristics:

l. For no reason whatsoever, your car would crash
twice a day.

2. Every time they repainted the lines in the road,
you would have to
buy a new car.

3. Occasionally your car would die on the freeway for
no reason.  You
would have to pull over to the side of the road, close
all of the
windows, shut off the car, restart it, and reopen the
windows before
you
could proceed.  For some reason you would simply
accept this.

4. Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left
turn would cause
your

car to shut down and refuse to restart, in which case
you would have to
reinstall the engine.

5. Only one person at a time could use the car unless
you bought
"CarNT,"
but then you would have to buy more seats.

6. Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the
sun, was
reliable,
five times as fast and twice as easy to drive- but
would run on only
five percent of the roads.

7. The oil, water temperature, and alternator warning
lights would all
be replaced by a single "General Protection Fault"
warning light.

8. New seats would force everyone to have the same
sized butt.

9. The airbag system would ask "are you sure" before
deploying.

10. Occasionally, for no reason whatsoever, your car
would lock you out

and refuse to let you in until you simultaneously
lifted the door
handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio
antenna.

11. GM would require all car buyers to also purchase a
deluxe set of
Rand McNally road maps (now a GM subsidiary), even
though attempting to
delete this option would immediately cause the car's
performance to
diminish by 50% or more.

12. Every time GM introduced a new car, car buyers
would have to learn
to drive all over again because none of the controls
would operate in
the same manner as the old car.

13. You'd have to press the "Start" button to turn the
engine off.

Moreover, GM would become a target for investigation
by the Justice
Dept.

Gentlemen, 

I met with Craig Young (MG US) last week, who is keen to progress metals 
business with large US corporates (e.g. Anheuser Busch), on the following 
basis:

o Assume ENA and US Corporate are existing parties to ISDA/Credit Support 
Documents (the "Master").

o ENA and US Corporate would agree to expand range of OTC products to include 
OTC metal derivatives under the Master.  The principals to the metals trades 
would therefore be the US Corporate and ENA.  These trades would however be 
"arranged" by MG London Inc. (an FCM) as "arranger" in the US for ENA.

o Enron Metals Limited (EML) from London would agree to provide metals prices 
to ENA and/or MG London Inc. in the US, and in return receive a commission 
from MG London Inc.

o ENA would back-to-back OTC metals derivatives with EML via an intra-group 
ISDA Master.

Look forward to your views.

Thanks.
Justin
Probably should add Mark Evans for London generally.  Matt Lee for Singapore?

asked to send the list to each of you for your input.  Please let me or 
Leslie Hansen know of any additional contacts or changes that you feel we 
need to make to the list.




We should get together with the right tax person/people - maybe Jeff can 
figure this out.

I just spoke to Frank, and spoke to Jeff Blumenthal earlier this week about 
tax issues arising out of Amita executing documents on behalf of EOL and 
ENA.  Frank just informed me that the Japan office has also been provided 
with stamp of Sheri Thomas's signature so they can execute PA's out of 
Japan.  Frank and I were thinking we might want to get together sometime next 
week to discuss this.
Janette - Here is the report with my changes - I have not been able to find 
Travis or Anne to see what changes if any they would like to add but will let 
you know when I hear from them.

Andrea will coordinate from here on. Please make yourselves available to work 
on this effort in that I do consider it one of our highest commercial 
responsibilities.

Thank you for your efforts.

Greg,

Here is the ETA version in my directory.  I think a few minor changes may 
have been made (e.g. EnronOnline LLC is now the Enron party) and the 
definitive version is on the website.  You can access it there if you have a 
guest user ID.  If you need an ID, just let me know and we'll have the EOL 
people issue one for you.  I'm also attaching an early version of the 
Password Application (current versions also online and accessible even 
without an ID) since it may cover a few issues not addressed in the ETA.  I 
usually think of the two pieces as one agreement.

Stephanie Harris called back this morning to say that Jim will not be in the 
office on any of our proposed dates.  She suggests we try the first week in 
March.  Any possibilties there?

Subject: Andrea's Trip




Based on the current schedule of work here in the office we have two sets of 
dates that would work for Andrea to visit Houston to meet with Jim Derrick. 
She could be in Houston late Monday morning, Feb. 15, and would leave Tuesday 
night, Feb. 16, or arrive late Thursday morning, Feb. 25, and leave Friday 
evening, Feb. 26.  Could you find out if Jim Derrick and Mark Haedicke will
be available to meet with Andrea on any of these dates?  Thanks.


Initial thoughts - 

Can we use Enron Australia as the counterparty to avoid these issues for now, 
and then when a book has been established assign all the positions to Enron 
Japan?

Can we get (or maybe give?) the rep if we soften it a bit by taking out the 
word "ordinary" or maybe the entire phrase "in the ordinary course of its 
business"?

Is there a government agency that can give us an opinion or "no action" type 
of letter to give us some comfort that we are OK?  It may not be quick enough 
to get us through this trade but it might open the door for future business.

If the end result is that there is no adequate fix and local counsel advises 
that we are taking significant potential criminal liability, I would think 
that both parties would be willing to agree to unwind the trade.  If 
necessary, my suggestion would be to raise the potential for criminal 
sanctions issue to Mark H.  (What are the potential sanctions?)

Have spoken with Joe Hirl.  If there was any way we can take advantage of or 
use for the purposes of establishing Enron Japan weather exposure, all the 
exposure of other Enron companies, this should help us to establish 
legitimate weather exposure.  Enron always has weather risk and we keep a 
global weather book although of course we have open positions sometimes.

Obviously we are mostly concerned about criminal liability.

It seems to us that if we cant do the first deal, there is no position for 
market makers here, which just doesn't make sense.

       << File: Weather-HDD-Floor-OTC-ToaRejmb2000-10-20!.doc >> Dear
Jeremy,

      Pls see for your information my email to Alan, Mark and Alan.

      As discussed, your answers to my questions can be quite brief
and pls cross
      reference previous advice rather than repeating it.

      I think the answer to question 1 - whether we can give the
warranty - has
      got to be no.  So short and sweet on this is fine.

      Re whether we can go ahead without the same (c)(ii) from them
(but with
      (c)(iii)) is a harder question and I understand that all you can
do is
      explain our risk and exposure, in light of the current factual
situation.

      This is a risk appetite question at the end of the day.

      Jane

      Dear Alan and Mark,

      I am going to need you to help me make a risk decision.  I
welcome input
      from Mark Evans but he may be more comfortable leaving this up
to Alan and
      Mark because Alan and Mark have been involved in this gambling
issue from
      the beginning.

      Jeremy Pitts and I have had a brief conversation re my email to
him below,
      this afternoon, but he will not be able to get written comments
signed off
      by Japanese lawyers to me until Monday.

      The situation relates to the Tokyo's office's first weather
derivatives
      deal, which is with a company called Toa Reinsurance.  In a
nutshell the
      situation is that negotiations have come to a standstill because
neither
      side can move on their positions re the gambling warranties.
The deal of
      course though has already been done over the telephone several
weeks ago.

      In a nutshell then, based on discussions with Jeremy Pitts, but
to be
      clarified by Japanese lawyer on Monday, the situation is:

      1.   In terms of Enron Japan's ability to trade weather
derivatives here,
      we are operating in the grey even if we can get warranty
5(c)(ii) from
      them.

      2.   ToaRe will not give us the important warranty - 5(c)(ii)
below,
      because they say they can't.  They say they are not actually
"entering into
      the deal to hedge weather related risks arising in the ordinary
course of
      their business" - which is what the subject warranty says.  B&M
have
      advised that the obtaining of this warranty from a counter party
helps keep
      us in the grey and out of the red in terms of what we are doing
and also
      gives us comfort that the counter party can do the deal.

      3.   ToaRe is, in addition, separately asking us to give them
the same
      warranty.

      Jane McBride analysis

      Re 3 - Given that our legal situation is grey at best, I do not
think we
      should be giving the warranty they have requested.  They say
they will not
      give us that warranty.  The issue then is whether we can go
ahead without
      getting the warranty from them, bearing in mind that a binding
telephone
      deal has been done.

      If you agree with me that we can't give the warranty, then we
have to
      decide whether we can go ahead without getting the warranty
referred to in
      (2) above, from them.  I am not sure however that in practice we
even have
      a choice given that the trade has been done.

      If we go ahead without giving and without getting the warranty,
the risk to
      us is that we are more likely to be in breach of the prohibition
on
      gambling in the Criminal Law.  Are we willing to take this risk
and who
      needs to give me this answer?

      Jane

      Dear Jeremy,


      I would like to refine the following instructions.  There are
two (only)
      issues on which we need specific written advice and they both
relate to
      Warranty (c)(ii) of the draft which says "XYZ is entering into a
weather
      derivative transaction to hedge weather related risks arising in
the
      ordinary course of its business".

      1.   (a)  Can Enron Japan give the warranty at this stage in its
growth?
      Have we already had any written advice from you on whether Enron
Japan can
      warrant along these lines?  If so, when?  If not, the facts seem
to be
      that:

         Enron Japan plans to trade commodities which are energy
related but
         because we are still building up the business we are not
trading these
         products yet.
         As you know, we are getting into the power market.  If we
have done a
         weather derivative, then we can of course offer better prices
on the
         electricity deals we are negotiating.
         Other Enron companies are of course already trading many
weather
         dependant commodities and power.

      It could be argued therefore that unless we can rely on the
weather related
      risks of other Enron companies to justify our weather derivative
      transacting in these early days, that this is a speculative
transaction
      constituting gambling (depending on how the law on this works).
It is
      understandable that ToaRe would want us to warranty in effect
that we are
      not gambling because we are asking them to do so.  I know we
have had sign
      off from B&M re our weather derivative trading but I wonder if
anyone
      considered what the situation would be before we ourselves had
other
      transactions giving us weather related risks.

      (b)  If not, how could it be amended so that we can give it?

      (c)  If still relevant in the context of your answers to (a) and
(b) above,
      they did offer previously to take out all warranties so that
neither party
      gives any warranties.  The deal cannot be cancelled because it
was done on
      the telephone late Sept.  Accordingly, what is the practical
risk of us
      proceeding without the benefit of any warranties from ToaRe
(including the
      warranty that they are under the Insurance Business Law - ie an
insurance
      company.)?

      2.   They are insisting they not give (ii) and that we be
satisfied with
      (iii) only for the purposes of the Gambling Law  Pls confirm in
writing
      whether you think we can still go ahead on this basis.

      Thanks.

Brent - does this mean Tana should not allow any non-Argentine customers to 
have access to these products?  The general rule has been to allow complete 
access unless there was a legal impediment - logic regarding who will want to 
trade what doesn't seem to enter into it.

		 Subject: Appointments of Agents and Attorneys in Fact

I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, 
and when we need such authorizations, let's make sure the resolutions are 
appropriately limited.  My thoughts are as follows:

1.   We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts.
2.   It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully 
selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place 
and there is master agreement already signed.
3.   There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way 
agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign.
4.   Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp.
5.   Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more 
than one year and revoke all prior authorizations.

Please give me your comments.

Mark   Here is the confirm template (used when an ISDA Master is in place)


This is the index language for EnronOnline.  We would use something similar 
for the offline confirms.I got your voice mail and agree with the strategy of meeting with the 
Senator's staff before sending the letter.  It would be embarrassing to 
suggest that we don't have a view on issues that should be important to us.

Re: the letter itself, if you want to make it even stronger, you could point 
out in your discussion of EnronOnline that we believe that the site could 
have been designed such that the volume of business through the site would 
have been significantly larger but for the uncertainty and restrictions in 
existing law and regulation which would be corrected by the bill.Here are my revisions.  Let me know if you have any questions.You can remove me from the distribution list.Thanks for the resume - I'm looking at a number of internal candidates from 
APACHI, CALME and Southern Cone but will keep this one on file (and pass it 
along - might be good for Richard Sanders).

I guess my fear is that you have not been included in the conversations and 
set-up of EOL's discussions
with HoustonStreet.com and QuickQuote.com.

Subject: City Streets


Just came back from a meeting in which Jennifer deBoisblanc Denny and Torrey 
Moorer informed everyone about the new venture 
between HoustonStreet.Com and Enron and QuickQuote.com and Enron.   In 90 
days, HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com will be offering products offered 
on EOL.

I solicit comments from everyone.

As I understand it, a party wishing to trade gas and power can log onto 
HoustonStreet.Com and  deals offered on EOL will 
magically appear. The party might think, "Hey, I can't do better than this on 
EOL, I'll take this deal".  The deal is transacted   
and HoustonStreet.Com number is assigned.  As soon as the "Do the Deal"  
button is clicked, the transaction is sent to EOL where
it is validated.  An EOL deal number is assigned but as far as the party 
doing the deal is concerned, the deal is a HoustonStreet.Com deal.

In the case of a gas deal,  the deal will be bridged to both Sitara and 
TAGG.  The deal at this point would have four deal numbers:

  HoustonStreet.Com Deal #
  EOL Deal #
  Sitara Deal #
  TAGG Deal #

Based on the meeting, the following requirements surfaced.  If you are in 
TAGG,  you should be able to access the deal using
HoustonStreet.Com  Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the TAGG Deal #.

If you are in DCAF II,  you should be able to access the deal using 
HoustonStreet.Com Deal #, or the EOL Deal #, or the Sitara Deal #.

This requirement implies that the capture windows in TAGG and Sitara ( I 
assume ) will need to be changed to capture both
the HoustonStreet.Com Deal # and EOL Deal #.  The TAGG Deal number itself  is 
assigned by the Capture program.

This will require a database change as well as fairly significant ( it was 
assumed that there is only one "Originating System")  program modifications 
to TAGG Deal Capture, TAGG Deal Clearing,  DCAF II, and Enpower Autoconfirm ( 
clears Power deals ).

Now for some issues:

1) Who is the internal party on the deal that is to appear on the 
confirmation?  Whichever Enron entity  offers that product on EnronOnline 
will be the party for these trades as well.  Will a HoustonStreet.Com and
 a QuickQuote internal party be set up in Global Counterparty?  

 There are implications for Global Counterparty since all address information 
is set up based on who the external party is doing business with.

 In other words, if there are new internal parties, the address information 
set up for these same external  parties that do trades on EOL will
 have to be set up again for doing business with the new internal parties.

2) Is the confirm to sport a HoustonStreet.Com logo and a QuickQuote.com 
logo? No.  The confirms may reference the platform on which the trade was 
done but otherwise it should look just like a regular Enron confirmation.

3) Who is to sign the confirmation letters when signatures are required?  
Same process as exists for EnronOnline transactions.

4) Contract numbers will have to be set up just as they are for trading under 
EOL.  But who are the contracts between?  If
 new internal parties are set up for HoustonStreet.Com and QuickQuote.com, 
then contracts will have to be set up
 between the new internal parties.  But since a HoustonStreet.Com deal goes 
through EOL, how will the appropriate
 contract be assigned?; i.e., if Koch does a deal through HoustonStreet.Com, 
is  a different contract assigned 
 in EOL versus if Koch does the deal through EOL itself? Seems to me it 
should be the same - we only have one agreement with Koch.



 











The confirm form is one of the many current templates used by the confirm 
desk depending on the specific transaction type and the counterparty.  For 
instance, this template is not the used for a swap (e.g. not a cap, floor, 
collar or swaption) and would not be used even for a plain vanilla swap if 
the customer had not signed an ISDA Master Agreement.  The index language can 
be used in a variety of contexts but again depends on exactly which type of 
trade you are doing.  But I thought you guys had decided to use the first 
price published in the following month rather than the average of the entire 
month language attached so this may not be the final version.

Here is the confirm template (used when an ISDA Master is in place)


This is the index language for EnronOnline.  We would use something similar 
for the offline confirms.



Unfortunately Euromoney is no longer offering their courses.  They were by 
far the best around and it's a real shame.  There is a PLI course being 
offered in NY in mid November (at which I'm speaking on commodity 
derivatives) and ISDA has a conference in London on collateral arrangements 
and the ISDA Credit Support Documents.  Neither is anywhere near as good as 
the old Euromoney courses but both would probably benefit Jane.

Please offer your apprval to the following Product Type:

US Pipeline Capacity  NNG (Firm) 

The related Products are capacity products being offered by Nothern Natural 
Gas Company. As there are regulatory issues concerning the viewing of 
proprietary information by the market affiliates of NNG, chinese walls are in 
place through the operation of policy.

You may notice that there is no Sigma Factor associated with this Product. 
The SF has purposely been set to zero, as the Credit area of NNG will be 
responsible for the daily review of exposure to their Counterparties, and 
will coordinate any Credit issues with the Credit area of ENA.

Attached please find an example of a related Product Type.

I need to ask that you expedite this approval. In order to have the Product 
Type available for this coming Monday I must have the full approval by no 
later than this Wednesday (tomorrow) at Noon.

If you have any question, please feel free to call.

I'm not sure if you guys are on this mail list but here is the most recent

		 Subject: CEA Update



Senate Agriculture and Banking staff, Treasury, the CFTC and the SEC met
this afternoon to discuss Senator Gramm's proposed changes.  Preliminary
reports indicate that agreement on 7 of the 34 issues was made earlier in
the afternoon.  It is unclear what the 7 items were, however, the meeting
broke in order for Gramm's staff to brief the Senator on developments.  When
the meeting resumed Gramm's staff reportedly backed off the prior
agreements.  In sum, no progress was made at the end of the day.  The staffs
agreed to meet again tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m. (On an side note Senator
Gramm's staff indicated that only a handful of banks supported the bill)

We also participated on a conference call with the AdHoc Coalition and the
Chicago Futures Exchanges held by Tom Ewing this afternoon.  Ewing advised
that he had a discussion with Speaker Hastert who is well aware of the
importance of this issue. He encouraged all of us to make renewed appeals to
the House and Senate leadership and as many Senate contacts as possible.

In my estimation, tomorrow will likely be our last opportunity to have any
sort of impact on Senate activity.  At the end of the day we will either
have a deal or negotiations will have failed.  I would suggest making the
following contacts tomorrow morning with a simple message:  1) We are aware
that the staffs are continuing to work on resolution of outstanding issues.
2) It is vitally important that these issues be resolved and that passage of
the legislation occur this year.

My recommendation would be to deliver this message to the following
entities:

1.  Senator Gramm -- since his staff is under the impression that only a
handful of banks support the bill.
2.  Senator Leadership -- Lott and Nickels
3.  Senate Agriculture Committee Members - Republican and Democrats
4.  Senate Banking Committee Members - Republican and Democrats
5.  House Leadership - Hastert, Delay and Armey

* Calls to Lugar are not necessary

Finally, I am of the firm belief that this legislation stands a worse if any
chance of enactment next year.
We need to give this our best shot tomorrow!

Many thanks!

Mark, It seems to me Erica's advice needs to apply not only to this NDA, but 
probably all of the NDA's that are going to originate from the Houston based 
EnronCredit.com business team.  Further, it should apply not only to NDA's, 
but their whole business they are originating from Houston, yes?  Maybe you 
need to talk to Erica...

attached are three CFTC no-action letters, the first of which (Channel 4)

The other two letters (Altra and QuickTrade) relate primarily to natural gas,

FYI - I'll talk to her about their model and plans in a little more detail.  
In the meanwhile, given that they create a link to us either way, we might as 
well allow them the use of our logo.  In case they become a big eye-ball

Will check with Mark for his opinion.

Rahil,

Thanks for visiting Energy News Live.  We are working to correct the
spelling of EnronOnline in the Exchange menu and you should see the change
by the end of the week.  The reason EnronOnline is not represented as a
logo, like Houston Street and TradeSpark, is due to legal constraints.
Williams does not have legal permission to display Enron's logo, only the
link.  As future phases roll out, we would like to work with your legal
department to obtain these rights.

Thanks for the feedback and please let me know if you have any further
questions or suggestions.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Daly

Happy hour with staff, not family :-(I won't be able to be on the 11:30 call this morning.  I have given Elizabeth 
a copy of the 'omnibus' document we probably used if the put options sold to 
Puget Sound were derivatives and described the arguments we could make that 
the imposition of the proposed price cap would be a Market Disruption Event.  
If it is a Market Disruption Event the most likely outcome under the contract 
(since it will last more than 3 days and we presumably will not be able to 
negotiate an agreed price) is that "the Floating Price shall be determined in 
good faith by ENA, by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes."  I'm 
not sure what dealer quotes would get us under these circumstances.  Can 
dealers quote prices in excess of the price cap?

In the days immediately before the application for a price cap, Puget came to 
us and asked us to enter into several put options.  We did so. I am advised 
by the traders that if this price cap were to actually be in effect,  our put 
option transactions would not make sense for us economically and we would 
never have entered into them had we known of their intention to make this 
filing.   I am under some pressure  to explain two things:  (i) whether the 
fact that they knew they were going to file for the cap when they did the 
options is some kind of fraud, and (ii) whether the WSPP Agreement or our 
ISDA swap agreements have any clauses in them to address this kind of 
thing,ie. is this some kind of "illegality" issue?  I am working on the 
second issue and have discussed it with Mark Taylor, but on the first issue, 
I need advice from Richard and anyone else who can help.----cgy

I know that you will be at a management meeting the exact same time that this 
conference is scheduled
to take place, but I was hoping you could assign this task to someone else in 
ENA Legal.  As you will note
on the agenda attached below, we have placed the Legal Department at the top 
of the agenda after the 
introduction to discuss "Legal Implications of the Electronic Marketplace".

This discussion should conceivably include discussions of the following 
topics:  

Electronic signatures (in particular EnronOnline)
Websites for delivery and executing confirmations (Commodity Logic)
See "XIII Future Trends" on Page 4 of the agenda

Please let me know as soon as possible if this will be possible.  As you can 
see, this is a very important
topic for us.  Call me if I can help clarify any points.  

One other point - I am assuming that you guys are the head guys for financial 
and physical legal decision 
making for Houston, Calgary and London.   For your information, there may be 
some lawyer types coming from the London
Global Markets group.

Also, JAD means Joint Accelerated Development.

In Net Works we receive a lot of new ideas from around the organisation which

ideas.  I currently have quite a few in my inbox.

Would everyone be able to make a meeting on Friday mornings?  Say 8:30 for 30

Anyone else who should attend?

Jim - The CEA legislation has died and risen again so many times over the 
last two weeks.  As of yesterday, Senator Gramm (the one obstacle to final 
passage) told a group of banking lobbyist that he opposes the legislation in 
full, but would consider moving the legal certainty provisions for banking 
swaps.  This is not good for us and it is not good for the entire 
legislation.  We are still trying to discern what exactly Gramm wants and 
what he is up to.  We should know by later today the ultimate fate of the 
bill.

Mark,

Many thanks for your message.  Re your reference to UK laws on Equity 
Trading, I assume that you are referring to the proposed Equity Trading 
facility in London;  I trust that  you also received my detailed e-mail on 
that topic of yesterday evening.  Please note that I have now received a fax 
from Alan Aronowitz with the Houston trading policy (containing Chinese Wall 
information), to which I refer in that e-mail - I shall be considering the 
sufficiency of that policy for UK purposes later today. 

Re your request for advice on the extraterritorial effect of the U.S 
securities' laws, this is a new question which we have been asked to look 
at.  In my view, there will be some extraterritorial effect of such laws on 
the activities.  I have also discussed this issue with Scott Sefton who has 
provided me with a general overview on this, noting particularly the U.S. 
Insider Dealing laws and potential U.S. reporting and disclosure of 
interests' requirements; however, Scott has suggested that we retain external 
U.S. counsel for in-depth advice on this, with which I agree.

If you agree that we should instruct external counsel on this issue, I would 
be more than happy to deal with this from London;  please let me now which 
external counsel you would wish to use.  In my and Scott's views, we should 
use expert  "SEC"-knowledgeable counsel in New York, such as either Cravath, 
Cadwallader, Davis Polk, Cleary's, etc.

Please just let me know - I would be able to instruct external counsel today, 
get an estimate of their time for dealing with the US aspect and report back 
immediately.        

Kind regards

Mark: 

Implementation of the EOL project in Brazil had been postponed for a while 
because of regulatory matters. The Market Rules were still being discussed 
and had not been approved by ANEEL, making it impossible for us to implement 
EOL, from a regulatory standpoint. Recently (about a couple of weeks ago), 
ANEEL issued Resolution 290/00, approving the Market Rules, subject to 
certain amendments. The amendments will be implemented in stages over the 
course of the next few years. After Resolution 290 was issued and the 
regulatory issues were partially resolved, the EOL team decided to work on 
the project again. I am now in the course of adapting the ETA, GTC and 
Password Application for use in Brazil. I will probably have drafts for 
comments within the next 10 days. I am not sure about the time estimate for 
completion of the project as a whole. I believe Remi can give you a better 
idea of the schedule.

I will forward to you in a separate e-mail the legal opinion that we received 
from outside counsel, addressing the issues in the memo prepared by your

Subject: ADA Findings

I have met with Gustavo Mengui, one of the most active representatives of ADA 
today.

My findings are the following:

ADA is very active and taking a leading role on the NETTING ISSUE. Good news 
is that they consider that they will be able to pass a law that redifines 
netting on the bankrupcy law by year end. They assume that they will have 
"media sanci?n" before mid December. Media sanci?n is basically having 
approval by one of the chambers (Diputados) and a strong support to going to 
the Senators Chamber shortly after. We will receive the law project today. 
The law project was designed by Hector Alegria. Gustavo assumes that they 
will be available to talking with our legal team upon request.
They have received from the Central Bank a request to propose all necessary 
changes in the regulations so as to have the (interest rate mainly) 
derivatives market going asap. This shows a fertile ground on this 
institution for our future conversations. 
On the CNV's side, he stated that the porject of law (on netting) was 
actively supported by this body. ACtually, he commented that CNV officials 
were active speakers when this matter was treated in the commission session 
at Congress.
ADA is working with PWC on the tax issues. ADA and PWC are preparing to 
present the government officials their proposal for the Ingresos Brutos 
treatment of derivatives in the City of Buenos Aires (makes me think that we 
have been talking to the right guys these last days).
Gustavo was crystal clear that, although they have been supported and funded 
by banks, they are a Foundation and they are open to working with Enron. He 
insisted that he does not expect conflict of interest to arise and that the 
energy sector is strategical for them, specially considering the recent 
evolution in financial energy trading.
There will be some issues regarding the support ADA will give to the Rofex 
effort of creating an energy market. The OTC versus the formal exchange issue 
is to be addressed.

ADA is willing to work with us on the future and we might have to do some 
follow up meetings to get this type of news earlier.
My personal opinion is that we might like to go ahead with our conversations 
with regulators and officials but I doubt whether we should go with ADA or 
not. There are various pros and cons.

Lets talk for 5 minutes,

Bernardo

Subject: Proposed London Equity Trading Desk

Mark,

Further to Mark Haedicke's e-mails, for your information please see below my 
e-mail of yesterday evening to Mark Haedicke and Scott Sefton re the impact 
of English law on a potential Equity trading desk based in London.

Kind regards

Subject: Proposed London Equity Trading Desk

I have reviewed the above proposal (which includes having had some in-depth 
conference calls with Slaughter & May, London) and conclude that the project 
is technically and legally viable provided that the points listed below are 
dealt with.  Mark, once you have read this note, if you would like to discuss 
the contents with Scott and me, please do not hesitate to give us a call.

SFA Authorisation and Structure

On account of the potential frequency and size of trading (even on an 
execution-only basis for ECT Investments Inc), the London Desk should be 
authorised by the SFA.  The personnel involved in the activity should be 
registered with the SFA as, at least, Securities Representatives, and 
preferably as General Representatives.   

Accordingly, subject to Tax Department's input, the London traders should be 
located in EEFT (already SFA-regulated) which would act as arranger or agent 
for the existing Houston-based equity trading corporation, ECT Investments, 
Inc (the latter as principal).

Subject to Tax and other internal considerations, it would also be possible 
for EEFT to act as agent to do this business for, as principal, either 
ECTRIC, the proposed replacement vehicle for ECTRIC,  or a new UK unregulated 
entity (the latter would apply if a UK book was required).  A UK entity, as 
principal, would be "unregulated" if it was a purely passive booking company.

Provided that the ultimate principal is either ECT Investments, Inc., ECTRIC 
or an unregulated UK principal, there should not be any UK regulatory capital 
requirements.

The SFA would need to be informed in advance of our intention to have an 
equity trading capability in London and EEFT's SFA business profile would 
need to be extended to cover both arranging and dealing as agent in respect 
of equities.

Transaction Reporting        

As the business would be SFA regulated per the above, SFA Rule 5-49 would 
require all transactions to be "Transaction Reported" - for pure cash equity 
business (wherever the equities are listed) this would be accomplished by 
computer-entry of trade details which would then download to one of the 
London Stock Exchange's ("LSE's") systems known as either "SEQUAL" or 
"CHECKING".

The purpose of such reporting  is not only to enable the LSE and SFA to 
establish daily market volumes, etc.,  but also, for example, to provide the 
relevant information to the LSE's surveillance unit which actively monitors 
all trades for signs of Insider Dealing.

Systems' impact 

On the above structure, there should be no extra systems' requirements, 
except:-

 PC screens for the traders having feeds of market quotes / market 
information (e.g., Reuters, Telerate, etc):

potentially a computer-link for settlement purposes

a computer-link for the Transaction Reporting of executed deals to the LSE 
(see above)

a computer-link to produce exception reports of executed deals to enable a 
Compliance Department to monitor for Disclosable Interests in Shares (see 
below) 

a computer-link to produce reports of executed deals for monitoring against 
the Watch and Restricted Lists (see Insider Dealing below)

Accountants, e.g., Arthur Andersen, would be the best placed to advise on the 
correct form of computer-links, especially those for Transaction Reporting 
purposes.

Disclosure of Interests in shares          

Re UK listed companies there are the following disclosures to be made of 
equity interests:-

S. 198 Companies Act '85 - acquisition of 3 % interest or more, or disposal 
to below a 3% interest, or acquisition of each whole % above a 3% interest of 
a UK Public Co's voting capital requires to be disclosed to the company.  
Group interests / concert party interests are aggregated to arrive at the 
thresholds and "interest" includes a right or option to acquire shares.

Substantial Acquisition Rules - acquisition of over 15% interest in a UK 
public company requires separate disclosure to the Company and, if listed, to 
the LSE.

Rule 9 Takeover Code - acquisition of 30 % or more of UK public company's 
voting shares leads to a requirement to make a cash offer for the remainder.

S. 212 Companies Act '85 - UK public companies can request at any time an 
entity to disclose to the company particulars of their, and other persons', 
interests in the company's share capital, including such details for the last 
three years.

Rule 8.3 Takeover Code - during an "offer period" relating to a UK public 
company (and the offer is a "securities exchange offer"), persons owning or 
controlling directly or indirectly 1% or more of relevant securities of that 
company (including cash-settled derivatives) must disclose such interests to 
the Take-Over Panel.

Please note that there may be similar rules in other jurisdictions, depending 
on where the relevant equities are listed - indeed in some jurisdictions 
there may be  prohibitions on foreign ownership of equities. 

Insider Dealing   

Looking just to the UK legislation (The Criminal Justice Act 1993), the 
various criminal offences of Insider Dealing are committed, basically, when 
an individual has Inside Information (meaning unpublished price-sensitive 
information) concerning the securities of an entity or entities (whether UK 
or non-UK) which are officially listed in any State within the European 
Economic Area or admitted to dealing, or quoted, on a "Regulated Market" 
(e.g., including the major European markets, NASDAQ, etc).  Please note that 
"price-sensitive"  means likely to have a significant effect on the price of 
any securities - not just those of the entity or entities in respect of which 
one has the knowledge; and "securities" includes shares, debentures, options 
to subscribe for shares / debentures, depository receipts, futures and CFDs.  
Once in knowledgeable possession of insider information, the offences are 
commited if one deals in price-affected securities in relation to  that 
information, or encourages another to so deal or discloses the information.  
The offence is punishable by imprisonment and / or fines.

        The offences are highly technical and there are certain defences 
available.  

The manner in which to try to prevent the internal commission of the offences 
is to put in place, simply, "established and effective" Chinese Walls between 
those individuals who would be involved in the Equity Trading facility and 
others in within the Enron Group who may have such inside information, to 
prevent the potential flows of Inside Information between those with such 
information and the Equity Traders in London.  Both I and Slaughter & May 
feel that potentially replicating in London the Enron Chinese Wall  policy 
actively followed in Houston could suffice in this respect as it is generally 
felt that the US requirements should be at least as stringent as those 
required in the UK.  Alan Aronowitz is in the process of  sending me 
Houston's policy in this regard for review and upon receipt that policy will 
be reviewed accordingly.

However, the relevant Chinese Walls would need to be put in place for Insider 
Dealing purposes between, in my and Slaughters' views, (a) on the one side, 
the Equity Traders and (b) on the other side, originators and traders, and 
persons involved in any corporate finance, M&A, Joint Venture, and financing  
activity.         

Not only would the Chinese Walls need to be implemented, but also they would 
need to be actively monitored by a Compliance Department in London to ensure 
that they were being observed and effective.

In addition to the Houston Chinese Wall policy, there should be implemented 
both a "Watch List" and a "Restricted List" procedure (I understand the 
latter already exists and would need to be combined with additions to such 
list in London ) - the Watch List does not actively prevent trading in 
relevant securities, but is an intermediate step before a stock is placed on 
the Restricted List: i.e., companies in which Enron is involved in sensitive 
transactions would be placed on such a list and an internal Compliance 
Department should then actively monitor for any unusual deals by the Equity 
Traders (e.g., by volume etc) in stocks of the Companies on  such list.  If 
any irregular trading activity is then spotted - it could be internally 
investigated.  Obviously, an internal procedure would need to be established 
to gather information on sensitive transactions so that they could be placed 
on the Watch / Restricted Lists as appropriate.

Other Confidential Information

In addition to any specific Insider Information, various Enron Group entities 
will be party to specific Confidentiality Agreements (or other forms of 
Agreement, e.g., Master Agreements, containing confidentiality clauses) with 
third parties, pursuant to which the Enron entities may have confidentiality 
obligations to those third parties and which may prevent the contracting 
Enron entities from disclosing certain information to affiliated Enron 
entities.

Obviously, in order to comply with our various obligations in this regard we 
would need either to check each contract or ensure that Enron personnel were 
aware of their obligations in this regard and never disclosed to the London 
Equity traders any information covered by the confidentiality obligations.  
The Watch List could be used to log, for monitoring purposes, companies to 
whom Enron owes confidentiality obligations.  

Both with regard to Insider Information and this form of confidential 
information, employees would need to be actively trained to ensure that only 
generally available market sentiment on a third party could be passed on to 
the London Equity traders and not more specific information.    

Compliance Department 

If this proposal moves ahead, my suggestion is that Enron in London would 
need to hire an experienced  Compliance professional for the following 
purposes:-

active implementation of, review of, and consistent monitoring of, the 
Chinese Wall policy;

active monitoring of executed deals against Watch and Restricted Lists;

active monitoring of executed deals for Disclosable Interests in Shares in 
the UK and similar rules and prohibitions in other jurisdictions;

handling SFA and  LSE queries on Transaction Reporting; 

handling potential LSE and Takeover Panel queries on executed Transactions; 
and

running continuous training courses for Enron personnel on Insider Dealing, 
confidentiality obligations, etc.  

In addition, such person could have responsibility for the implementation of, 
monitoring of, and ensuring compliance with, SFA Conduct of Business Rules 
and Moneylaundering compliance, and any relevant exchange rules, firm-wide in 
London across all of Enron's business - e.g., its OTC Derivatives' 
business.    
Kind regards

Subject: London Equities Trading Desk - US legal advice

Further to my Questionnaire to Maureen Bartlett at Cadwalader on the 
applicability of U.S. securities' laws in the context of a London Equities' 
Desk, I received Maureen's responses in a lengthy telephone call yesterday 
afternoon.  I shall only comment where according to Maureen we shall have to 
be mindful of an issue - where I do not comment, Maureen said the answer to 
the Question was "no" (i.e., good news for us).  Hence, Maureen's advice:-

Q 6 - Generally, ECTII would only bear responsibility to US regulatory 
authorities for EEFT's acts and omissions if ECTII was a "knowing 
co-conspirator" in an EEFT act or omission which violated US securities' 
laws.  EEFT would not have any responsibility for its acts and omissions to 
any US regulatory authority.  EEFT would not have any responsibility to US 
regulatory authorities for any acts or omissions of ECTII except again only 
to the extent that it may have colluded with ECTII.  The only exceptions to 
these positions are set out below.  

Q 7 - U.S. disclosure requirements re interests in equities - where initially 
EEFT acts as pure arranger without any discretion for ECTII (i.e., pure 
execution-only facility in London), the U.S. disclosure requirements will be 
down to ECTII to comply with (as the principal).  This will still be the case 
if EEFT moves to having agency authority (i.e., having discretion) to book 
trades to ECTII - the only difference here is that there will need to be 
extra careful monitoring to ensure that EEFT does not do a deal in a stock 
out of London which, when aggregated with other Enron Group interests in that 
stock, take us over a disclosable amount (e.g., under s 13d SEA '34, a 5 % 
holding of a stock registered under s 12 SEA '34; and 10 % under s 16a SEA 
'34).  This will mean that we shall need extra careful use and monitoring of 
Watch and Restricted Lists between London and Houston and may be London 
having a policy preventing acquisition by the London desk of a large block of 
stock (to be defined) in any U.S. entity without Houston's consent.

Q 8 + Q 9 - U.S. Insider Dealing laws apply to (a) stock of U.S. issuers and 
(b) stock of non-U.S. issuers listed in the U.S..  EEFT would not be liable 
under U.S. Insider Dealing laws unless it knew that it had price-sensitive 
information (as defined under U.S. laws) and dealt in either (a) or (b) or 
encouraged another to deal, etc.  ECTII  would not be liable vicariously to 
the US authorities for EEFT in this respect - ECTII would have to have 
committed the offence itself, e.g. by having the knowledge then dealing etc 
or colluding with EEFT.  Vice versa applies re ECTII - EEFT.  Basically this 
comes down, once again, to having adequate. and well monitored Chinese Walls, 
procedures, education of staff re what they can and cannot do etc.  As well 
as other Chinese Walls, obviously ECTII staff would not be able to pass 
price-sensitive information which is not publicly known to EEFT staff and 
vice versa.

Q 10 + 11 - Re Reg S new issues.  As ECTII would be the principal and is in 
the US, not only is ECTII directly prevented from buying a Reg S offering 
within the lock-out period but so would EEFT as ECTII's arranger / agent.  If 
EEFT purchased a Reg S offering within the lock-out period, ECTII would have 
broken the rules.  Obviously this would have to go into the compliance manual 
governing EEFT's conduct and again London trading would need to be actively 
monitored for compliance.

I still firmly believe that there is nothing in the above advice which makes 
a London equities' facility for Houston legally and technically difficult - 
it comes down to Chinese Walls, policies and procedures and active daily 
monitoring by a compliance department of the activities of the London desk.

Maureen will shortly be sending me her written confirmation of the advice 
which she gave me over the telephone.

Kind regards

Thanks for your note and glad to hear you are all doing well.  I'd love to 
have lunch - let's do it on the 21st (I'm out of town the earlier dates and 
the 22nd is the day before Thanksgiving).  We do have a lot to catch up on 
(EGFinance changes, new hires for the group, new internal lawyers for the 
group, office space issues) - I haven't wanted to bother you at home but 
things are definitely moving around here - as usual I guess.

MarkI enjoyed it too - actually it's just as well that I was carted off when I 
was - I was sound asleep by 8:30 and still feel the affects.It looks to me like another case of an obvious error (i.e. the counterparty 
should have known it was a mistake).  I'm afraid we've just been lucky that 
the numbers have been so far off - some day we're going to have one that is 
too close to call obvious.

		 Subject: Appointments of Agents and Attorneys in Fact

I would like to do fewer resolutions authorizing non-vps to sign contracts, 
and when we need such authorizations, let's make sure the resolutions are 
appropriately limited.  My thoughts are as follows:

1.   We have a lot of vps that can sign contracts.
2.   It is generally ok to have confirmations signed by certain carefully 
selected directors since we are confirming a trade that already took place 
and there is master agreement already signed.
3.   There are certain very routine agreements like pipeline right-of-way 
agreements that are ok for carefully selected directors to sign.
4.   Confidentiality agreements should be signed by a vp.
5.   Any authorization for a director to sign should expire within not more 
than one year and revoke all prior authorizations.

Please give me your comments.

Just checking in on your conversation with Bob Schults (sp?).? If there is 
any news, please let me know.? I will be back in DC tomorrow, leaving SF 
about 3 p.m. today.? I am working on an "as soon as possible" assumption, but 
it will still be a few days before I have useful drafts for you to review.? 
But hopefully we are beyond the question phase.

Thanks, 

Bob

Here is a powerpoint presentation that may give you a bit of a feel for the

Legal Mark following on from Paul Smith's email attached  are the revised 
GTCs.  I am advised your signoff is required prior to them being loaded into 
EOL . Essentially they are the previous HDD and CDD "Australian weather swaps 
GTCs. Each GTC has been amended slightly so it may be used for a product  
where the weather observations are derived from a source other than the 
Australian Bureau of Meteorology. I have reviewed the GTCs and confirm they 
are acceptable.


Would you please signify your concurrence by email.     


Tax I have seen a response from PWC yesterday that appeared satisfactory. 
Perhaps Susan or Heidi can confirm this  to Jeff who I understand also needs 
to give his signoff.

Dale attached are the final product descriptions.  Please call me if you have 
any questions.

Thanks for your concern but please don't worry about it.  I was able to get a

it was a productive morning for me in any event.  I don't think I'm available

Mark,
I want to apologize once again for having you come out on Saturday morning to 
help with interviews and find out that you were not needed.  I appreciate 
your support and cooperation and on behalf of the Associate and Analyst 
Programs would like to give you a shirt  to demonstrate such.  Please let me 
know what size you wear.  You will have to guard this shirt with your life 
because many interviewers have been asking for them and we have not been 
giving them out :).

Again, I am sorry for any inconvenience we caused you and promise not to let 
it happen again.

Thanks for your continued support. 
Charlene Jackson


Greg - looks good to me on the legal procedures.  My only comments would be 
(i) that I'm not sure that the confirm desk generates deal tickets (I thought 
they were prepared by the commercial guys) and (ii) we usually don't have the 
commercial guys sign confirms as a control matter, even when it's an unusual 
matter.  I agree about Tana.

Mark, as discussed here is a draft of my proposed e-mail for your review.  
Please let me know if it accurately reflects our understanding and I will 
then send it out to everyone.  I really think that having Tana come up for a

Subject: Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process

Further to a discussion with Mark Taylor, I wanted to confirm our collective 
understanding/proposal regarding the legal procedures associated with the 
financial trading process in Canada.  As you are all aware, all financial 
confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm 
desk in Calgary.  However, it seems that there has been some confusion 
relating to the legal procedures associated with this process.

In short, I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process 
regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for 
Canadian physical confirms.  That is, as is currently the process for 
physical deals, the Canadian confirm desk will generate all deal tickets and, 
to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward, will 
generate, have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation 
letters, with no involvement of the legal department.  However, for any 
financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms 
(as well as amendments), just as with physical transactions, the confirm desk 
will generate the deal ticket and provide it to Linda or Sharon in Calgary.  
Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the 
deal tickets, which will be reviewed and approved by either myself or Mark 
Powell.  Once approved, the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing 
lawyer, checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review, 
approve and have executed.  The executed confirm will then be returned to 
either Linda or Sharon, who will attend to distributing it to the 
counterparty.  Again, this will only be required for transactions which are 
out of the ordinary.

With respect to negotiating and implementing, and addressing ongoing legal 
concerns with respect to, ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, Mark Taylor's 
group, and I understand specifically Mary Cook, will continue to have 
responsibility for such matters.  Therefore, to the extent that we need to 
put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal 
concerns about the implementation of the ISDA, the process will be the same 
as it has been in the past, meaning that those matters will be dealt with in 
Houston.

Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing 
initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations, I think it is essential 
that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run 
each of Sharon and Linda (as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggy's 
group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters) through her 
ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our 
legal group to deal with these matters.  As well, we will need to ensure that 
Linda and Sharon receive (either from Houston or Dianne) electronic versions 
of all confirmation precedents (ie. confirm forms, amendment forms, etc.) 
necessary for them to properly undertake these activities.

If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me.  Otherwise, I think we should implement these 
procedures as soon as possible, including having Tana join us for a few crisp 
winter days in Calgary.

Thanks

Greg

On a more serious note, I just wanted to confirm that the latest reorg did

Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The current phase 
of the office construction process is almost finished.  We have been given a 
completion date when (we hope) your new office will be ready of Monday, 
November 20.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move.Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The current phase 
of the office construction project is almost finished (we have been given a 
completion date of Monday, November 20).  There is good news and bad news.  
First the bad: the office which you currently occupy will be in the next 
construction phase which will begin as soon as possible after the current 
phase is finished.    Now the good:  we have an office for you to sit in 
until your new office is ready.  Joya Davis has submitted the move request 
and will have details directly.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and 
arrange your move.This issue was much easier when all we traded were energy commodities,=20

I think your "final" office changed when your group changed - the East 
Origination/Gas Trading Group is in the southeast quadrant of the floor and 
they have given you 3882, just  four doors down the hall from where I am 
now.  The construction workers are gone for the day if you want to stop by 
and see it.

The first market disruption fallback (after a 3 day waiting period) is an 
"Alternative Price Source" which would need to be spelled out in the long 
description - but that only works if we have an alternative price source to 
specify.  It's also important to make sure that the feared event is included 
in the Market Disruption Event definition.  I think this is the relevant 
language from the GTC:

7.  Market Disruption.  If a Market Disruption Event has occurred and is 
continuing on any Trading Day, the Floating Price for such Trading Day shall 
be determined pursuant to the Floating Price Source specified in this 
Transaction for the first Trading Day thereafter on which no Market 
Disruption Event exists; provided, however, if the Floating Price is not so 
determined within three Business Days after the first Trading Day on which 
the Market Disruption Event occurred or existed, then the Floating Price 
shall be determined by reference to the Alternative Floating Price Source 
specified in this Transaction, if any, which is not subject to a Market 
Disruption Event.  If no Alternative Floating Price Source is available or 
has been specified, and the Market Disruption Event continues for more than 
three Business Days, then the parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree 
on a Floating Price (or a method for determining a Floating Price), and if 
the parties have not so agreed on or before the twelfth Business Day 
following the first Trading Day on which the Market Disruption Event occurred 
or existed, then the Floating Price shall be determined in good faith by 
Enron, by taking the average of two or more dealer quotes. 

"Market Disruption Event" means, with respect to a Floating Price Source, any 
of the following events (the existence of which shall be determined in good 
faith by Enron):  (a) the failure of the Floating Price Source to announce or 
publish information necessary for determining the Floating Price; (b) the 
failure of trading to commence or the permanent discontinuation or material 
suspension of trading in the relevant futures contract, options contract or 
commodity on the exchange or market (e.g., NYMEX) acting as the Floating 
Price Source (the "Exchange"); (c) the temporary or permanent discontinuance 
or unavailability of any relevant Floating Price Source; (d) the temporary or 
permanent closing of any Exchange acting as the Floating Price Source; (e) 
the imposition of trading limits by the Exchange such that there are limits 
on the range within which the price of the relevant commodity may fluctuate 
in the prompt month and the closing or settlement price of such commodity on 
such day is at the upper or lower limit of that range; (f) a material change 
in the formula for or the method of determining the Floating Price; or (g) a 
material change in the content, composition or constitution of the relevant 
commodity.

		 Subject: Re: EOL Power Products

Further to John's e-mail below, I do not believe that we need to build this 
type of language for alternative settlement into the long descriptions for 
financial power products, as both the form of ISDA and the GTC that we use 
for confirming financial transactions (which contain the legal terms and 
conditions that will govern Canadian EOL financial power transactions) 
contain market disruption provisions.  These market disruption provisions 
provide the mechanism for determining the index price if the referenced price 
is unavailable or there is a material change in the formula or calculation of 
the referenced price, etc.  I am just waiting to confirm with Mark Taylor 
that the on-line form of GTC applicable to financial transactions is the same 
as for the form used for transactions not entered into through EOL.

Thanks

Greg

We should add some language to the EOL power descriptions to include a

of Alberta becomes defunct.  I won't put any language in regarding market

not.


I'm going to be hard to get next week - Monday & Tuesday I'll be in NYC

I will try to break from my meetings during the day on Mon., Tues. afternoon

it's already pretty full).  Just let me know - my assistant (Taffy x57373)

I'm speaking at a conference in ny again but never got around to making any 
plans - any chance you're free?Hello from Texas.  It's probably been about six years since we last spoke but 
I thought I'd drop you a line to see how you were doing.  I saw Pete Datos 
for brunch when I was in town a couple of years ago and he seemed to be fine 
but I have been very bad about staying in touch with people.  Ted Bockius & I 
are still together - he works at an internet start-up company doing their 
public relations work.  I'm still a corporate lawyer at Enron working on 
financial contracts and e-commerce stuff.  I get to nyc 3 or 4 times a year 
so we should get together for a drink or a meal some time and catch up.

Hope you are well.

 I'll be at the Peninsula (55th & 5th) (212)956-2888.  I will have my cell 
phone but no guarantees that the battery will last (713)206-8080.  Either of 
the places you mentioned would be fine with me - my conference is at the PLI 
Center (on 7th around 51st or 52nd).  Just tell me when & where!I concur in David's analysis.  Any idea who the target market is in HK?  If 
we have specific customers in mind, would it be possible to approach them 
directly rather than making the password application generally available?  
It's not clear to me that even that would solve the problem since there would 
still be some targeted HK residents, just not the public.

Marsh/EU/Enron@Enron@ECT
		 Subject: Re: Hong Kong Weather Products

There is one issue outstanding concerning our due diligence for Hong Kong. It 
does not relate specifically to Hong Kong weather but rather whether we 
should revisit  the decision to last month list a Hong Kong Password 
Application on the EOL registration screen. As I raised in my email last week 
the Hong Kong regulator (SFC) has issued internet trading guidelines that 
state that internet sites that "target" Hong Kong residents will be expected 
to comply with HK securities legislation. 

Under the HK Protection of Investors Ordinance there are restrictions on 
making public offers regarding (i) securities; and (ii) "investment 
arrangements relating to property other than securities".  Whilst it is 
difficult to see how a HK weather swap (or any other product listed on EOL ) 
would fall with in these definitions it is not beyond doubt that the SFC may 
want to investigate EOL if they believe it is targeting offers to Hong Kong 
residents. My concern is that if the SFC logged onto EOL following the 
publicity surrounding the HK weather launch they will find a password 
application for Hong Kong residents. The SFC could well take the view that a 
HK password application is evidence that EOL is targeting Hong Kong. Again it 
is the act of making the offer, not entering into the transaction that is the 
subject of the Ordinance. Hence arrangements to restrict with whom we 
ultimately enter into password agreements or conduct trades  may not be 
viewed as conclusive in determining to whom offers are being made.     

l  have had an opportunity to review a 27 September 2000 advice that Jonathan 
Marsh obtained from Allen Overy (HK). In Section 2 they raise similar 
concerns with regard to the Protection of Investors Ordinance. 

Way Forward

I would recommend that the Password Application for Hong Kong immediately be 
removed from the list on the EOL registration screen, at least for the 
present. The chance that this HK PA may invite the attention of the HK SFC 
needs to be recognised. (This possibility exists irrespective  of the 
decision to list HK weather products. Clearly on a practical level a greater 
awareness in HK of EOL  generated by the launch of HK weather may be the 
catalyst that attracts  SFC interest.)  Whilst our legal analysis has not 
identified any  breach of HK legislation by EOL I would prefer if we 
mitigated the risk of an  SFC instigated dialogue on this point.  

This would mean a Hong Kong resident would need to call up to get a password 
application.

If we wish to include on the parts of the EOL site that are available to the 
public (ie where no password is needed) provisions that are unambiguously 
directed to HK residents then it would be prudent for us to talk to the SFC 
first. I note Allen & Overy also raised this as a possibility.

I recognise this is a judgment call on what is one of those grey areas. But 
the prospect of publicity in HK for EOL was the determining factor in 
concluding that this more conservative approach is warranted at present.

Since we are still waiting on a response from Amita regarding the 'legality' 
issue of offering Hong Kong Products, I have not made the necessary changes 
to the Australia static data components nor have I 'squirrelled' the AUS

		 Subject: 11-21-00 EPG/ECP Transaction Update

It has been ten very hectic days since I last broadcast an update.  As most 
of you know we have had significant issues with El Paso regarding their 
willingness to cooperate in the monetization of the Mesquite Notes we were to 
receive in the transaction.  The worst issues have revolved around the 
structure and strength of the El Paso parent contingent guarantee and the 
structure and necessary Mesquite and El Paso disclosures required to monetize 
the Notes.  Accordingly we made a proposal to El Paso on Wednesday of last 
week to change the fundamental structure of the transaction.  

Our proposal was to have El Paso provide us with a commodity contract under 
ISDA documents (but without a collateral threshold) and the usual 
unconditional parent guarantee that was "in the money" with payment terms 
identical to the deferred payments we were to receive under the Mesquite 
Notes.  El Paso obtained the necessary clearances for such a transaction 
Friday night.  We now expect to pursue this structure instead of the more 
difficult 144A monetization.  I have attached a Transaction Summary and a 
transaction diagram to help explain the specific of our proposal.  In 
addition, I have attached a revised offer analysis; we now expect slightly 
lower monetization costs.

With the 144A issues off the table we believe that we will now be able to 
sign a Transaction Agreement by the end of next week.  We also expect it to 
be much easier to satisfy by year end the resulting shorter list of 
conditions precedent to closing.

There have been some other minor changes the most significant of which is 
that Merlin will not be selling its $30mm of SubNotes as part of this 
transaction.  Please call if you have any questions.


I'm following up with Cindy Skinner of ECT HR to try and get this resolved.  
Thanks for letting me know it was still an issue.

He should be in Co# 359 and RC# 0303.

The pulp & paper group is looking into physical trading in the Far East 
(mainly Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore).  I am looking into any tariff or 
taxation issues related to transacting in this region.  I've been talking to 
Peter DelVecchio and he was in the process of contacting outside help in this 
matter but then I realized that some of this work might have been done 
already since we trade liquids in that part of the world.

Do either of you know if this information is available internally?

Please let me know when the vaccine is available.We have not admitted hedge funds to trade in the US because of the heightened 
regulatory scrutiny of trading with hedge funds generally since the Long-Term

Subject to my comment below and to the Segregated Accounts notice (for

However, in the case of the Galtere, please check with the US PCG whether 
trading with Hedge funds gives rise to any particular legal issues.

smiley faces - they even have a name: emoticons.  They don't often look like 
you'd expect and most of them are sideways -  only one I know is the smiley 
face  :-)   Hope you had a nice birthday!

I won't need the final locations until Joya has to submit the churn request.  
Since the construction isn't scheduled to be complete until 12/22 I wouldn't 
think we'd need it until the 15th - Joya will have a better feel for how far 
in advance we need to schedule the churn.

The legal assistants (and any lawyers who start before the construction is 
done) will be put in the cubes we have.  When we run out of cubes we have 
space to build more.

One question I would have is the location of the paralegals/assistants coming

revision is the TETCO M3.  It is currently defined as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone M3.


Dick wants to ensure that the delivery shall also include any location on the

We need to get a ticker item posted on the website as soon as possible.

After discussions with the legal group, given the mandate about including the

the new year when we have more certainty around the Alberta market.

I have revised the financial swap term sheets that you reviewed several weeks

To my knowledge, Brent does not work for me.  I don't believe it would be 
consistent with Enron Corp's policy to have a lawyer working for the business 
developer. ECT Legal and EI Legal need to get together to decide who Brent 
should be reporting to, but I can assure you it should not be me.  This is a 
seperate issue from who is covering Brent's costs.  I do believe he is under 
the Argentine office's cost center since he is dedicating 100% of his time 
here.  This is consistent with EISC's policy of allocating legal costs out to 
the business unit that is incurring the cost.  However, I have had no input 
into Brent's compensation or bonus and believe he considers himself to be 
reporting to ECT Legal.

The main issue that I see with the description you sent me is the same one 
that we spoke about a few weeks ago.  

 What should the consistent market convention for determining the first 
tranaction be?  If we use the current NG trading convention we will quote the 
premium swap as the "first transaction"  and the discount as the second.  
This will present consistency problems if we are trading near parity in the 
calendar with different months changing position in the curve. You just have 
to look at some of the summer spreads to see the confusion that may result.  
Having the near dated swap as the first transaction in all cases would 
eliminate that issue but will not match the current trading convention.  I 
will check with John to see if he has any opinion on the matter.  The product 
description would have to be written such that any customer would be easily 
be able to determine the correct direction to trade.  

I will discuss this and the entire description with John on Tues. and get 
back to you .

Thanks

In case you haven't already looked at the Fee Agreement draft, here is a 
slightly revised version.  Also attached is a revised BETA.  The changes 
marked in the BETA are a combination of the commercial guy's comments and my 
revisions of those comments (hopefully marked separately).  Unfortunately I 
didn't get the changes in the Fee Agreement marked.  
Bob:

Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is 
that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus 
will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents 
before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic 
corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent 
elsewhere.

The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates 
to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term 
Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, 
orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of 
teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of 
messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge 
funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying 
much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past 
and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: 
notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal 
regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to 
speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a 
large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the 
financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.]

For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the 
internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or 
individuals - for similar reasons).  

Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their 
customers just as Brokers cannot.

Harry,

Further to our conversation last week, I have listed below, in two segments, 
the top CTAs who presently manage more than $100mill each, and the top Hedge 
Funds, based upon their likelihood to manage assets in diversified markets, 
that may include tangible commodities. My understanding of EOL is that it 
presently caters primarily to this latter group and offers only tangible 
commodity trading instruments.

As I explained, the principle difference between a Hedge Fund and a CTA 
(Commodity Trading Advisor), is the manner in which they control the assets 
that they are contracted to manage. In the case of a CTA, the money can not 
be held by the CTA itself. The underlying investor will open a clearing 
account with a respective Clearing House, the assets will remain in this 
account and the CTA will trade based on the full monetary value of that 
account - in many cases an investor may well fund this account with Notional 
Funding. NF are 'abstract funds' not actually deposited at the Clearing 
House, but acknowledged as being available should variation or original 
margin be required. The CTA has no control over these funds. All monetary 
transactions must be executed by the Clearing House, and must be authorized 
by the investor. The CTA does have the ability to execute trades at an other 
trading house - such as Enron, through a contractual document called an 
International Uniform Give-Up Agreement. We have quite a few hundred of these 
agreements in NY. Essentially, all parties involved in the execution of a 
trade - the CTA, the Investor, the Executing Broker and the Clearing House, 
agree to allow the CTA to trade wherever he/she wishes and Give-Up that trade 
to the Investor's Clearing House. Since every regulated trade must ultimately 
clear the respective exchange, for a CTA to trade OTC and Swap agreements, 
would require prior notification to an investor that his/her money may be 
required as collateral against such a trade, and would be required to be 
deposited at Enron. A Hedge Fund has greater flexibility to trade such 
instruments since in the majority of instances a Hedge Fund does exert 
control over the funds it manages. A Hedge Fund typically structures its 
investment vehicles as Off-Shore limited partnership funds. As such the Hedge 
fund has direct control over the underlying assets and can move those assets 
to wherever they may be required - if investing via Enron On-Line, it would 
move the assets to Enron, for example.

This first list, below, is comprised of the top flight CTAs :



The following list is of Hedge Funds that I believe are trading Commodities 
and other non-security investments. It is by no means complete ! :



I would be happy to make any introductions that I can to any of the above 
names. Some we know well, others we may have to network ourselves into. 
Caroline and I met a few weeks ago and I passed some names on to her - I am 
not sure where that has got to yet, but if you need any further information 
please call me.

In what currency will the proposed DPC hedge be denominated?  One of the areas causing us legal heart-burn in the weather derivatives area 
here in the States is the insurance and re-insurance company counterparties.  
In most states there are different laws applicable to insurance companies - 
most of which are regulated - including entirely separate insolvency 
regimes.  Just another item for your radar screen.

Dear all,

All activities in Europe with regard to Weather Risk Management products have 
now formally been amalgamated into a global weather risk management group 
managed by Lynda Clemmons in Houston.  Having concluded two transactions in 
Europe, the first being the first transaction of its type in Europe with 
Scottish Hydro-Electric and a second in the Netherlands, we are encouraged 
that the product will be as successful in the European market at managing 
volume risk due to adverse weather as it has shown to be in the US.

In London, Nick Mooney will be heading the European Weather Risk Management 
group reporting into Lynda in Houston.  Nick's group will be responsible for 
supporting all European Origination groups in the pricing and structuring of 
these products.  This management structure was put in place to enable all 
European origination groups to have the maximum support on strucutring 
weather products for their clients, ensure market development information and 
intellignece is readily and easily desiminated across Euopean groups and is 
designed to maximise the value to Enron of this new and exciting market. In 
addition to supporting orignators, the Weather group will be responsible for 
developing the hedge market for Weather Derivative Transactions with 
non-energy counterparties across Europe - including the Insurance, 
Re-Insurance, Finance, Broking and Retail sectors.

This new and exciting development in the risk management arena, is another 
example of where Enron again has developed a product to manage a risk, which 
was previously not manageable by our customers.

I'll be there!One of the problems with Indian derivatives is that when foreign exchange is 
involved, Reserve Bank of India approval is required in advance of the 
transaction.  A $US deal would involve foreign exchange from an Indian 
counterparty's point of view.  Certain transactions have pre-approved status 
but an ECT commodity swap is not one of them.  I'm still trying to track down 
whether a commodity deal can be done at all, even with RBI approval.   I've 
also asked whether, if approved commodity swaps are permitted but not by ECT, 
it might  be possible to use an Indian bank or other approved dealer as an 
intermediary.

Since the Platt's Arab Gulf FOB Naphtha Index that is being used in the

Importance:  High
---------------------------------


Here is my list of some of the projects/contracts Andrea and I are involved
in or working on (recent comments are in bold):
TGS Secured Credit Facility--(Issue raised  by Don Black regarding the 
feasibility of pledging linepack gas.  We need to check with Robert George on 
this issue.)

Imbedded Capital Contracts--(Scott Porter raised the issue of developing a 
new form of template with Andrea and asked that we discuss the issue with 
Robert George.)

Distribution Contracts--The commercial group would like to have preapproved 
distribution contract forms available to give to customers so that the 
customer can submit them to the distribution company when electing a 
commercial bypass.  Only two distributors have had their form approved by the 
ENARGAS.  We are looking into what we can offer to our customers in the other 
distribution territories to speed the process of finalising distribution 
contracts with the LDCs to avoid long delays.

ENARGAS Expedientes--ENARGAS has issued an order to Enron to amend three of 
its gas contracts to modify references to firm transportation and to unbundle 
the pricing.  The ENARGAS also sent a letter to our customers which we feel 
overstepped their regulatory role.  The meeting between Roberto Pensoti and 
Hector Formica was held last Thursday.  Roberto had a follow up phone 
conversation with Hector on Friday and had a meeting Monday morning with 
Alicia Federico to get a feel for the amount of resistance we will get. We 
have been given a 30 day extension to respond to the order in order to have 
meetings with the ENARGAS and try to come to some resolution on this issue. 
The first meeting will be scheduled early next week.

Neuquen Tax Assessment--Andrea has faxed or emailed the pertinent information 
regarding the stamp tax assessment on the Technical Assistance Agreement 
between TGS and EPCA to George Frumkin, Anna Sepulveda and Michelle Blaine 
who will co-ordinate with TGS and Perez Companc on the strategy for 
responding to the assessment.  Michelle will call TGS outside counsel today 
in order to hire him to also represent EPCA.  EPCA has filed its response to 
Neuquen using the arguments prepared by TGS on January 27.  Michelle Blaine 
has requested information regarding what the next step by Neuquen might 
possibly be.  We will look into the issue.

Tax Lobbying--Jordan Mintz and Terry Thorn are proposing a series of meetings 
with government officials in late February and have asked Carlos Bastos to 
see if he can also arrange a meeting with Mr. Lenicov at that time.  Issues 
include determining whether the stamp tax and turnover tax issues can be 
lobbied at the national level or only at the provincial level.  There is a 
proposal that was floated that the turnover tax could be included in the VAT 
tax scheme which might solve the problem with the turnover tax.  The focus of 
the meetings is to determine how a lobbying strategy can be developed and who 
should be involved in the actual lobbying process.  Jordan Mintz is handing 
off the responsibility he had assumed on this issue to Jim Ginty.  Jordan has 
asked Carlos Bastos to see if he can set up a meeting with Mr. Lenicov on 
March 11th or 12th since Terry Thorn can be in Buenos Aires on those days.

Transportation Capacity Release Guidelines--Must review and comment on new 
ENARGAS proposed guidelines by February 5.  Comments were made on February 5.

Vandenfil--Vandenfil has filed for a pre-bankruptcy proceeding which has not 
yet been "opened" by the court due to the January recess.  For the last three 
months Vandenfil has made their payments only after our sending them
termination notices with a two business day cure period.    The most likely
scenario during the preliminary bankruptcy period is that our contract will 
be "continued" by the trustee giving us a priority in payment for ongoing 
deliveries of gas.  After the preliminary bankruptcy is opened if we have not 
been served notice that our contract is "continued" within 30 days we would 
be allowed to terminate the contract.  One of the risks that we face with 
this customer is that they may argue to the trustee that we cannot terminate 
the contract claiming we are providing a public service.

Imasa Bid--Format of Enron's original proposal structure changed.  Enron and 
Albanesi submitted joint termsheet to Central Puerto in November  where Enron 
proposed signing two contracts with Central Puerto, one for the supply of all 
the gas transportation and another for the supply for 60 percent of the gas 
requirements and Albanesi proposed two contracts, one for supplying 40 
percent of the supply of the gas and another for the building of the pipeline 
spur.  Central Puerto is studying the proposals and has not responded as of 
January 25, 1999.

Dow Pipeline Spur Feasibility Study--Enron and Dow are studying the 
feasibility of building a pipeline between TGS and two affiliates of Dow. 
Issues include determining whether our CEIASA shareholder and owners 
agreements preclude Enron from building spurs for end users and whether spurs 
that serve more than one customer can be built under current regulatory 
guidelines.  Andrea will be putting together a short report based on her 
meeting with Nestor Martinez.   A team meeting consisting of legal, 
regulatory, commercial, credit and structuring met yesterday to discuss the 
broad parameters of the Dow spur proposal.  The commercial group is preparing 
a first draft of a build, operate and finance termsheet that they would like 
to present to the customer on Thursday to be reviewed by Robert George. 
Credit is still doing its analysis of the two proposed counterparties.

Contract Review--Preliminary gas contract reviews for Central Puerto and Ave 
Fenix for Rob Rice and Federico Cerisoli.

Gas Deals:
Chauvco--20 day gas supply contract being drafted
Cerro VanGuardia--Amendment to the gas sale agreement being drafted to cover 
negotiated changes to the take or pay provisions.
Bagley--Two Offer letters sent to two Bagley entities for review, Enron was 
not the low bidder.  I have been asked by to look into how other "marketers" 
are avoiding the turnover tax and thus be more competitive than we are.  The 
customer is looking at the relative risks between firm distribution and 
interruptable distribution but is running up against a deadline for actually 
requesting a contract template for distribution services.  The contract is 
slated to begin March 23, however, the distributor has 30 days to respond for 
requests for distribution services.
Total--Spot master agreement proposed for transactions out of Neuquen.  Short 
term draft offer for gas out of Chubut being reviewed by Total.  A separate 
one year supply contract template supplied by Total is being reviewed.  The 
customers template contains the same type of language that gave us Antitrust 
trouble in the PCR contract.  Peidra Buena--Gas sale agreement for peaking
gas.    Final offer sent and Gas has started flowing.  We are now working on
a one year contract.  A termsheet has been sent to the customer. 
Dow--Negotiating offer letter format for sale of gas to two Dow affiliates. 
Gas deal is related to but independent of the spur issue.  A mark up of draft 
has been received the end of last week, Dow indicates that further comments 
are to be sent soon.

Power Deals:
We need to draft an output marketing form of contract for the purchase of 
electricity.

Argentine Signatories:
Scott Neal has approved a new structure for signatories in Argentina.  I will 
work with Hope Duggan firm on the new POA's.




I think I'll try to run this by Michelle Cash real quick - I'll get right 
back to you.

Subject: Indemnification

I wanted to run this agreement by you before I sent it to Randy.  The 
Directors and officers of Argentine companies have joint and several 
liability to the shareholders and third parties for their acts as directors 
and officers and therefore what often happens is that the companies agree to 
indemnify them as long as they are acting within their scope of employment.  
I have created this form out of several documents I have run across and 
wanted to know if it looks reasonable.  I will also check into whether it 
needs to be approved by the shareholders and whether an Argentine company can 
even agree to indemnify its directors and officers in advance of any action.  
Please let me know what you think.




Robert:

I believe that Sylvia Sauseda usually handles these matters.  Please let us 
both know the date you will be arriving with as much notice as possible so 
that we can have things ready for you.  We're looking forward to seeing you!

Subject: RE secondment

Mark, my secondment is coming up in a few weeks time. Sorry to trouble you 
about mundanities  but whom do I contact about arranging a desk, telephone pc 
etc. HR have told me it would be one of the assistants in ECT Legal. Any 
ideas? tks 

Here is your conversation with my revisions marked (deletions struck through, 
insertions in bold).  Hope this helps but feel free to call or write with any 
questions or comments:

A:   The CFTC regulates futures contracts and certain kinds of option 
contracts.  
SP:  What's a futures contract?
A:  It is a contract for the sale of a certain kind of  commodity through a 
regulated  exchange.
SP:  How is the contract different than a non-futures contract?
A:  Ahem,   just for your information, we call the non-futures contracts 
forward or over the counter contracts.  The big difference is that the 
forward contract does not must go to delivery while futures contracts do not.
SP:  I though the futures contracts went to delivery.  I remember getting all 
messed up on the gas side with delivery of NYMEX futures gas at the Henry 
Hub, and what about those stories of a guys getting a load of soy beans 
dumped in their front yards?
A:  Well, er,  yes they do sometimes  go to delivery, but they are not really 
supposed to relatively few of them go to delivery.  They are supposed to  
more frequently (actually the vast majority of the time) net out as financial 
transactions.  It's that option of settling financially that distinguishes 
the futures contract.
SP:  Well lets get to the point,  why are physical buy sells so bad?
A:  That's easy.  Because they look like futures contracts.  They are not 
intended to go to delivery.  And if you are trading in futures contracts you 
are supposed to be doing it on a CFTC regulated exchange. 
SP:  So what you are saying is that if we deliberately net out our physical 
deals and never intend to even try to schedule delivery under them we are 
trading in futures contracts and could be subject to regulation by the CFTC?
A:  You've got it.  But it's even worse than that - federal law says that a 
futures contract which is not traded on a regulated exchange is illegal: not 
only could the CFTC come after you but your counterparties could use that law 
against you to get out of performing.  So you can think of each contract like 
that as having written a free option.
SP:  Well how much physicality do we have to have to make it a forward 
contract?
A:  What do you mean?
SP:  Well, if we settled physically one day a month but financially the other 
29 days, would we have a futures contract?
A:  Oh for Christ's sake I've had it.   I'm telling you once and for all that 
physical buy sells are futures contracts and you can't do them now get the 
hell out of my office!--

Is this the basic idea and if so,  how much can we blend physical into it to 
cross the line into the domain of the forward contract?  --Christian 

Basically, yes.  A lot has to do with the look and feel of the thing but also 
the parties' intentions.  If we do not intend to make and take delivery, if 
we intend to settle financially - or even intend to just have the option to 
settle financially, we have a problem.  The closest thing we have to an 
exception to this is the provision for cover damages when one party fails to 
deliver.  That is a provision in the contract that might be argued gives one 
party the right to settle financially just by failing to perform.  We argue 
that this is still a forward and not a future because the parties in good 
faith intend initially that delivery will be made and a default occurs when 
there is a failure to make or take delivery.  Unfortunately, in the power 
world a large percentage of contracts may in fact get booked out.  However, 
each party enters into those contracts knowing that they have an obligation 
to make or take delivery and the book-outs may or may not happen - we do not 
enter into those contracts knowing that they will be booked out.  The 
book-outs occur after the fact by mutual agreement at the time of the 
book-out.  In fact, if we didn't want to book them out, we could stand on our 
legal rights and require all of our counterparties to make and take delivery 
(although I assume this might not go over well with many of them or with our 
scheduling desk if a book-out would be more convenient at the time).I am also admitted in New York which has recently instituted a CLE 
requirement.

Marc,

I agree completely and don't have any legal reason not to send the form of 
L/C we would require.  Unfortunately, given the nature of this transaction we 
can't use our standard form but will have to beef it up a bit.  Let me know 
if you're ready to send that and I'll get started on it right away - 
shouldn't take more than a day or so to get it ready.

Mark,

FYI: Ram Srivastav is the President of DPC. Can we send DPC the format of the 
Stdby L/C to advance the credit risk portion? We're not committing to 
actually putting a derivative in place, just familiarizing them with the 
necessary tools. The legal risk aspect will be covered when we get their 
outside counsel opinion sent to us. Please let me know. While I feel strongly 
that we need to cover all of ECT's bases, especially when dealing with the

risk by implementing a derivative through ECT.

ECT's counsel has advised me that the format for the Standby Letter of Credit 
to cover ECT's exposure on the derivatives will be sent to you/DPC as soon as 
you provide us with an opinion from outside (non-DPC) Indian counsel on the 
legality of commodity derivatives in India.

Pursuant to the above, please obtain a formal opinion from outside (non-DPC) 
Indian counsel on the legality of commodity derivatives in India, and send it 
to myself  at your earliest convenience.

Thanking you in advance,

Marc




Marc,

Here's a draft reply to your latest e-mail, which I would send to all those 
copied on your note to me.  What do you think?

Marc,

We have sought, and paid for, advice from Indian counsel concerning commodity 
derivative transactions with Indian counterparites.  We have had that advice 
updated and confirmed in connection with this proposed transaction.  The 
result of that advice is that we will require an opinion from DPC's outside 
counsel that the proposed transaction is enforceable against DPC before the 
transaction can proceed.  While I have no legal objection to sending a form 
of L/C that would be acceptable to us, it doesn't make much sense to go 
through the exercise if DPC will not be providing the necessary opinions.

Mark  Debbie:

I think we should probably do a special form for this particular 
transaction.  I've left a voice-mail to Marc to that effect.  There are 
several issues here that don't exist in our run-of-the-mill deals that should 
be covered in the L/C language.

MarkIn light of the rising frequency of human-grizzly bear conflicts, the
Montana Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers, hunters, and
fishermen to take extra precautions and keep alert of bears while in the
field.
We advise that outdoorsmen wear noisy little bells on their clothing, so as
not to startle bears that aren't expecting them.  We also advise outdoorsmen
to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear.  It is
also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear activity.  Outdoorsmen
should recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear dung.
Black bear dung is smaller and contains lots of berries and squirrel fur.
Grizzly bear dung has little bells in it and smells like pepper.


You guys around this weekend?We have asked for a legal opinion from the counterparty's Indian counsel but 
have not received it yet.  That's the reason I'd like to do a special form of 
L/C - we need to add some language that indicates enforceability of the 
underlying agreement is not a prerequisite to a draw.Marc - I know Bill well - give me a call (713)853-7459.

Mark/Steve,
Do either one of you know "Bill Bradford".  He is the risk management area.
I'm interviewing with him on Wednesday and just wonder what to expect.

Thanks!

Yes - it's definitely time to think about this.  My suggestion would be that 
we try to get Don to pay the expenses since the trip would be necessary 
regardless of who she was working for (EI or ECT).  Of course, if he balks, 
we'll foot the bill.

Is it time to think about when to bring Andrea to Houston to meet Jim 
Derrick?  Who's budget would it come out of?

Hmmm, interesting question.  Most of the guys I've interviewed have gotten 
dressed up even on casual days, but then we're pretty causal every day so 
it's hard to tell.  I don't think he'd mind if you called to ask.  That 
department is a little dressier than my area (they actually wear ties most of 
the time Mon - Thurs) but I think Friday is pretty casual there - and you 
have a pretty good excuse.  It might depend on who else (if anyone) you'll be 
seeing.  The reason they get dressed up so much is that one of the senior 
guys (don't know which one, but can find out if you want) on that floor is 
always in a suit & tie.  If you're also talking to him it might make sense to 
bring a change of clothes and use a stall after the interview.Sorry for the delay - we won't be able to go with you tomorrow night - hope 
you have fun anyway!

 - contrato de procesamientobrent.doc
The report of my absence is premature - I will be in our South American 
offices Mon. - Thurs. of next week but am in the office in Houston all of 
this week.

I am also not aware of any memoranda on point.  I have seen the issue 
addressed in an off-hand way in one or more articles (not really legal 
analysis) and will keep my eyes open for those.  The bottom line is usually 
that insurance requires an actual loss and proof of that loss before a claim 
can be made on the insurance while in the case of the derivative, no loss 
needs to be shown, only the actual weather conditions described in the 
agreement.

something I don't but FYI- he is out of the office on business for the next 2

We do have a memo from Cadwalader which discusses whether a weather contract

Exchange Act. I will fax that over to you now for info.

Subject: Follow up: C. Fishkin's Proposal and my Comments of 2/19/99


	

Mark:

 Just a brief note to follow up with additional information regarding the 
Global Information Site mentioned by Mr. Fishkin, and my comments to that 
section.   As I mentioned in my memo, Sheri Cromwell has been gathering data 
and working with the Internet group to come up with the initial draft for the 
ECT Legal website.    Sheri completed the first draft last Friday and asked 
me who will need to be involved in the review and approval of this 
information.  I mentioned to Sheri that you and Tana were working on a 
special project and that one of the goals was to create a Global Information 
Site or something similar, and that I had mentioned to you as well that she 
was gathering some data for that particular purpose.

 I'm not sure what your plans are regarding the Intranet Site, but since 
Sheri has already done this work I thought I would let you know in case you 
and Tana are interested in talking to Sheri and reviewing her work.  Sheri 
has a lot of good ideas and she seems to enjoy project development 
responsibilities, not to mention that she's had the opportunity to establish 
good relationships with the Internet team.   

Thanks.

Actually, I will be out of the office Mon - Wed of next week.  Tana is 
expecting you and will be able to get you started on the swap training 
program.  You will probably need to give her name at the receptionist in the 
lobby - her extension is x33399.  If she isn't around, Jan Dobernecker 
(x33427) will at least be able to get you in the building.  Your office will 
be EB3847 and your phone number will be (713)853-6121.  Have a good flight!

Nony:

I will be participating, possibly with Brent Hendry (Brent - are you 
available?), from Buenos Aires.  Will we need to set up a conference call so 
that both London and B.A. can be connected?  It's also possible that Martin 
will be back in Oslo by then.  I'm not sure what his plans are re 
participating.

Regarding the agenda, I would appreciate an update from someone on the 
internet trading plans in Europe.  In particular, I'm wondering if there are 
enforceability/statute of frauds type issues in Europe like we might face 
here and what research has been done to date in that area.  Since at least 
one of us will be on the line from Argentina, we might do a quick update on 
some of the significant problems we are having with the regulators there.

Subject: Indemnification

I wanted to run this agreement by you before I sent it to Randy.  The 
Directors and officers of Argentine companies have joint and several 
liability to the shareholders and third parties for their acts as directors 
and officers and therefore what often happens is that the companies agree to 
indemnify them as long as they are acting within their scope of employment.  
I have created this form out of several documents I have run across and 
wanted to know if it looks reasonable.  I will also check into whether it 
needs to be approved by the shareholders and whether an Argentine company can 
even agree to indemnify its directors and officers in advance of any action.  
Please let me know what you think.



Marc,

The game starts at 7:30.  Why don't we stop by to pick you up at a little

As requested, a thumb-nail sketch of the above. As you will see, the sky is 
generally blue , but follow up work will be required in one or two countries 
before we can give the all-clear.

Executive Summary

Generally, only the Czech Republic, Poland, the Netherlands (options and 
swaptions only) and Spain (options only) are countries/transaction types in 
respect of which we cannot begin marketing and trading now. 

In Germany, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the UK, the marketing and 
trading of ALL weather derivatives products can commence immediately. 

In France, the marketing and trading of ALL weather products can begin when 
we receive acceptance from SFA of our French passport application (in the 
next few weeks).

The marketing of, and trading in, Dutch weather swaps and Spanish swaps and 
swaptions can commence immediately.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------
The following questions are addressed in the case of each country

1. are weather derivatives regulated ( eg marketing restrictions/ 
licence/capital requirements etc)?
2.  could they be construed to be unauthorised insurance contracts?
3.  could they be construed to be gaming contracts?

Czech Republic  ---  1.  Totally unregulated
                                               2.  Possibly, yes (especially 
options) with criminal consequences if unauthorised
                                               3.  Unlikely if transacted for 
commercial purpose
                                         
France  ---  1.  Regulated in the same way as commodity derivatives (ISD 
passport available to EEFT)
                        2.  Unlikely
                        3.  No

Germany ---  1. Totally unregulated
                            2.  Not insurance contracts
                            3.  Carve out from gaming law possibly not 
available, but no problem if in good faith believe c'party is hedging 
(English law may improve analysis)

Hungary  ---  1.  Totally unregulated
                         2.  Highly unlikely (if individually negotiated)
                         3.  Highly unlikely

Italy  ---  1.  Totally unregulated
                  2.  No
                  3.  Probably not if transacted for commercial reason

Netherlands  ---  1.  Same as commodity derivatives, but capital requirements 
may apply to options and swaptions (we are checking this)
                                       2.  Unlikely
                                       3.  Unlikely if transacted for a valid 
commercial purpose (but we will clarify in light of possible criminal 
sanctions)

Norway  ---  1. Totally unregulated
                          2.  Probably not insurance contracts, but may be 
prudent to check with Banking Securities and Insurance Commission
                          3.  No problem if in good faith believe c'party is 
transacting for sound financial/commercial reason

Poland  ---   1.  No specific requirements now (eg under the Energy law)
                          2.  Unlikely, but unclear: need to check with 
Minister of Finance (English law would not help) -  up to 2 yrs' imprisonment 
for breaches
                          3.  Unlikely if transacted for commercial reasons, 
but need to check with  Minister of Finance (risk of 3 yrs' imprisonment and 
loss of power licence)

Spain  ---  1.  Totally unregulated if OTC 
                      2.  Swaps and swaptions, no. Options, unclear (risk 
higher if a premium is payable and contract a hedge). Result: options may be 
void
                      3.  No problem if one party transacts for valid 
commercial purpose

Sweden  ---  1.  Regulated in the same way as commodity derivatives
                            2.  No 
                            3.  No  

United Kingdom  ---  1. Regulated by SFA (must be transacted through EEFT etc)
                                             2.  No
                                             3.  No, provided one part 
transacts by way of business (Enron will).

Let's discuss this note before we distribute it more widely (including any 
comments you may have).

=ABB: Power Derivatives Trading In Germany Still Long Way Off

 [Dow Jones News Service via DowVision ? Rcvd: Mar 18, 05:51 AM ] 



By Axel Revheim 

OSLO (Dow Jones)--Derivatives trading in the German electricity market won't 
take off until certain structural blocks in the
power industry are cleared, paving the way for a spot market to develop as a 
first step, Jonas Kollberg, head of ABB Financial
Energy told Dow Jones this week. 

ABB Financial Energy is a division of Swiss-Swedish engineering and 
construction conglomerate ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd.
(ABBBY). 

A small number of large, vertically integrated German electricity companies 
are effectively hindering the development of free
trade - presenting a stumbling block by both owning the production of 
electricity and controlling the means of transmission, or
grids. 

Currently, if a third-party wants to transport power, it must separately 
negotiate access and prices for each grid - an impractical
arrangement for the spot market, Kollberg said. 

'The advantage of the Nordic model is that you have great liquidity for 
derivatives based on a broadly acknowledged system
price. You also have several producers creating a well-functioning spot 
market. I can't see how they're going to solve this in
Germany. They have too many isolated (monopolized) grid areas,' Kollberg 
said. 

Financial power contracts like futures, forwards and other derivatives are 
based on an underlying reference price, often an
average of spot price throughout a region or country. There won't be any 
power derivatives trading in Germany before an
acknowledged reference price is established, he said. 

A Liberalized Market In Law Only 

The practice among German utilities of pricing electricity transmission based 
on the distance traveled, is a powerful barrier to
trading, Kollberg said. In the fully liberalized Norwegian power market, for 
example, independent producers are charged fees
for access to grids based on an established point system. Producers pay the 
same tariff, regardless of how far the electricity is
transported. 

Germany's new energy law, in effect since April 1998, paves the way for all 
German consumers to choose who supplies them
with electricity. However, without clear, published grid access tariffs or a 
national reference price, few customers have, in
reality, been able to move away from their regional supplier. 

No decision has been made yet as to how Germany will organize its spot market 
for electricity sales. The first German electricity
bourse is likely to be set up in either Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Hamburg or 
Leipzig. But interested parties such as the Deutsche
Boerse in Frankfurt have acknowledged that a physical spot market needs to be 
in place before futures trading can be
introduced. 

Nord Pool, the joint Swedish-Norwegian power exchange, recently joined up 
with Germany's Landesbank Sachsen
Girozentrale, the Leipzig town authority and the Saxony state government to 
establish a power exchange in Leipzig. 

Using expertise gained in the Nordic market, Kjetil Knutsen at Nord Pool 
Consulting told Dow Jones that the plan is to develop
a spot market in Germany along the lines of the Nordic model. 

There will be one system price for the whole of Germany, based on spot prices 
in the seven regions which are controlled by
Germany's 'Verbund' regional transmission companies, he said. 

'One can solve the spot price problem,' he said. The question isn't whether 
Germany will have a functioning spot market, but
rather when, he said. 

Separation Of Producers, Grids The Key 

Even if Germany eventually establishes a reference price, the problem of 
vertical integration remains. One needs unbundling
(between producers and grids) to open the way for competition, ABB's Kollberg 
said. 

According to ABB's own analysis, between 78% and 83% of German power 
transmission lines are owned and controlled by
the big German power producers. 

As long as domestic producers have such grid control, power imports and 
exports from Germany won't be free, said Kollberg. 

Any overcapacity of French power generation could be imported to the benefit 
of German consumers. however, because
German producers control transmission, the tendency is to shield the domestic 
market from competition, observers said. 

French electricity imports could lower prices sharply for German end-users of 
electricity. According to Kollberg, there's an
overcapacity of 40 terawatts of electricity in France, while Germany too has 
an overcapacity of 31 TW. Michelle is going to discuss this with Sharon Butcher (an outside labor 
lawyer we use).  Apparently there is some corporate policy against 
indemnifying employees but she understands there may be a distinction here 
due to the nature of Argentine law in the area.   We'll keep you posted.I discussed this matter with Brent yesterday and I believe the correct title 
for Andrea is "Attorney".

Mark / Tana,

The origination team in Brasil is about to close Enron's first electricity 
trading transaction in Brasil (in fact it will be also the first one in 
Brasil). Just to summarise, we are negotiating the purchase of 3MW for 30 
days to sell it to an industrial customer.

I spoke with Andrea Bertone (our internal legal counsel) and we thought that 
the most efficient way to develop the contracts between Enron, the seller and 
the purchaser of power would be to use the model of contracts that Enron 
currently applies for the electricity trading transaction in the US, and then 
adapt them considering the commercial conditions of the deal as well as the 
Brazilian regulatory aspects. Therefore, I would like to ask you to send us a 
copy of such contracts, and since the power will be available on 01 April, I 
would really appreciate if you could send them asap.

Thanks and regards,

If Airlines Sold Paint......


BUYING PAINT FROM A HARDWARE STORE

Customer: Hi. How much is your paint?

Clerk: We have regular quality for $12 a gallon and premium for $18. How many 
gallons would you like?

Customer: Five gallons of regular quality, please.

Clerk: Great. That will be $60 plus tax.


BUYING PAINT FROM AN AIRLINE

Customer: Hi, how much is your paint?

Clerk: Well, sir, that all depends.

Customer: Depends on what?

Clerk: Actually, a lot of things.

Customer: How about giving me an average price?

Clerk: Wow, that's too hard a question. The lowest price is $9 a gallon, and 
we have 150 different prices up to $200 a gallon.

Customer: What's the difference in the paint?

Clerk: Oh, there isn't any difference; it's all the same paint.

Customer: Well, then, I'd like some of that $9 paint.

Clerk: Well, first I need to ask you a few questions. When do you intend to 
use it?

Customer: I want to paint tomorrow, on my day off.

Clerk: Sir, the paint for tomorrow is the $200 paint.

Customer: What? When would I have to paint in order to get the $9 version?

Clerk: That would be in three weeks, but you will also have to agree to start 
painting before Friday of that week and continue painting until at least 
Sunday.

Customer: You've got to be kidding!

Clerk: Sir, we don't kid around here. Of course, I'll have to check to see if 
we have any of that paint available before I can sell it to you.

Customer: What do you mean check to see if you can sell it to me? You have 
shelves full of that stuff; I can see it right there.

Clerk: Just because you can see it doesn't mean that we have it. It may be 
the same paint, but we sell only a certain number of gallons on any given 
weekend. Oh, and by the way, the price just went to $12.

Customer: You mean the price went up while we were talking!

Clerk: Yes, sir. You see, we change prices and rules thousands of times a 
day, and since you haven't actually walked out of the store with your paint 
yet, we just decided to change. Unless you want the same thing to happen 
again, I would suggest that you get on with your purchase. How many gallons 
do you want?

Customer: I don't know exactly. Maybe five gallons. Maybe I should buy six 
gallons just to make sure I have enough.

Clerk: Oh, no, sir, you can't do that. If you buy the paint and then don't 
use it, you will be liable for penalties and possible confiscation of the 
paint you already have.

Customer: What?

Clerk: That's right. We can sell you enough paint to do your kitchen, 
bathroom, hall and north bedroom, but if you stop painting before you do the 
bedroom, you will be in violation
of our tariffs.

Customer: But what does it matter to you whether I use all the paint? I 
already paid you for it!

Clerk: Sir, there's no point in getting upset; that's just the way it is. We 
make plans based upon the idea that you will use all the paint, and when you 
don't, it just causes
us all sorts of problems.

Customer: This is crazy! I suppose something terrible will happen if I don't 
keep painting until after Saturday night!

Clerk: Yes, sir, it will.

Customer: Well, that does it! I'm going somewhere else to buy my paint.

Clerk: That won't do you any good, sir. We all have the same rules. Thanks 
for painting with our airline.
Looks good to me.

I tried unsuccessfully to reach you by telephone - the number I was give for

The OMLX issue related to having the terminal of a non-US futures exchange in 
the US.  There is a related but different issue you can discuss with Paul 
Simons that came up in connection with the ZUMA 2000 trading system in 
London.  On that system, we would have been able to trade financial contracts 
electronically.  The problem was that our counterparties were also US 
entities and, in some instances, trading from the US.  I believe that the 
advice we received from Cadwalader was that if our counterparties were all 
outside the US we would have been able to trade on ZUMA 2000.   Of course, 
all of this relates to derivatives trading.  If the system you have in mind 
will be for the physical commodities, we should include Jeff Hodge in the 
discussion.

I have no objection to you contacting David Mitchell directly.  I am copying 
Paul on this note since it makes sense to coordinate with him since he has 
already dealt with similar issues.

Mark, in the course of our effort to establish internet-based click-and trade 
business for a number of commodities (mainly gas, power) in the main markets 
of Europe (and with respect to pulp&paper also possibly the US), I think, it 
is necessary to evaluate the CFTC issues. I understand that Cadwalader has 
given some advice earlier this year re. OMLX and think it may be best to 
contact them. Who do you think, I should contact (I understand, the person we

I seem to remember that our traders in Singapore did a deal with a PRC 
company a while back and it was our conclusion at the time that it was a very 
dangerous (perhaps unenforceable) thing to do.  My vague memory is that only 
financial institutions could enter into derivatives in the PRC and even then 
there was invariably a sovereign immunity risk.  Do you remember this and can 
you refresh my recollection?

Cynthia,

The EI LNG Group is looking at providing LNG price risk management for China. 
Could you please confirm whether China National Oil Company (Corp.?) and 
China State Power Corp. are creditworthy counterparties?  Before Doug and I 
talk to the traders I want to see whether we would even be willing to sell 
LNG risk management to them.

The structure the group is most likely interested in is 500,000 MT to 
1,000,000 MT per year for five to 20 years (depending on what our traders are 
comfortable with).  I imagine the Chinese would be interested in a cap or 
collar, and not a fixed price.

What other info do you need for a quick estimate?

Thanks,
Heather

One issue to keep in mind regarding membership in this exchange:  if there is 
no clearing house and the exchange is the counterparty to all transactions, 
who bears the liability when a third party defaults?  We certainly need to 
know if it is the exchange membership.  If not, how is the liability limited 
and on whose credit would we be relying if we trade?

Subject: APX - Membership Application

Just to let you know that last Thursday, we submitted, in the name of Enron 
Capital & Trade Resources Limited, an application at very short notice to 
become one of the first members of the Amsterdam Power Exchange.

The Exchange still has many outstanding issues to resolve re its mode of 
operation and I shall keep you informed of progress.  The Exchange is due to 
go live, however, at the beginning of May 1999 but our feeling is that there 
are so many substantial issues remaining to be resolved that either it shall 
not hit this deadline or, if it does, it will be in a very chaotic state.   
However please note that initially it is proposed that the Exchange is simply 
for day-ahead physical power deals; the Exchange is the counterparty to 
transactions and there is no separate clearing house.

It is proposed that at some future stage a financial futures' market will 
develop when our SFA-regulated entity will then have to become an Exchange 
member - but this is some way off. 

Kind regards

Mark 

Justin:

The mention of Statoil made me think of Norway.  Alliance doesn't sound like 
a Norwegian entity so it's probably not an issue here, but do you think we 
should discourage large volume and long term multiple trades with Norwegian 
entities given our continuing uncertainty over netting there?

We are discussing with Alliance Gas Limited (Statoil is their parent) a 
potential long-term, large volume gas swaption. Brief details are :

Enron as option seller
Option exercise period: present to December 1999
Term: 5-6 years, starting 2001
Notional monthly volumes: 18,000,000 therms

In the meantime, we have been negotiating a fully-termed ISDA Master, 
including Credit Support Annex, and seem to be close to finalising this.  As 
to the swaption deal itself, we await their Board's response.

Marcus:

I tried unsuccessfully to reach you by telephone - the number I was give for 
you appears to be at some other company entirely.  Please feel free to call 
me once you get this note to discuss further.

The OMLX issue related to having the terminal of a non-US futures exchange in 
the US.  There is a related but different issue you can discuss with Paul 
Simons that came up in connection with the ZUMA 2000 trading system in 
London.  On that system, we would have been able to trade financial contracts 
electronically.  The problem was that our counterparties were also US 
entities and, in some instances, trading from the US.  I believe that the 
advice we received from Cadwalader was that if our counterparties were all 
outside the US we would have been able to trade on ZUMA 2000.   Of course, 
all of this relates to derivatives trading.  If the system you have in mind 
will be for the physical commodities, we should include Jeff Hodge in the 
discussion.

I have no objection to you contacting David Mitchell directly.  I am copying 
Paul on this note since it makes sense to coordinate with him since he has 
already dealt with similar issues.

Subject: request for primer

Mark,
I am heading into another CFTC related analysis and desparately need another 
quick primer.  I would be very greatful if you could edit the following 
conversation and send it back to me like you did last time.  I kept that copy 
and it has proven to be invaluable.

 Know it All:  Yeah that CFTC stuff is pretty complicated.  You have to 
remember though that it is the option of settling financially that 
distinguishes the futures contract.  If you do a physical contract that has 
the option to settle financially it is an illegal futures contract if it 
isn't done on a regulated exchange  and it is just like giving the other guy 
a free option to termiate for illegality. So the risk in doing these things 
is that your counterparty can get out on the basis of illegality and 
secondly, you might find yourself suddenly regulated by the CFTC.  This risk 
is not to be confused with the other kind of risk which is where you write a 
mandatory financial transaction but wrap it up in physical clothing.  This is 
basically the risk of doing an unauthorized derivitive transaction and again, 
depending on the counterparty, you may have given a free option to terminate 
for lack of authorization. 

Tormented: Okay, okay, I think I've got that part, but what's all this option 
crap that people keep adding into the forumula?  They always say you can 
trade this and that and then they throw in the options.  Are options over the 
counter or under the counter or not on the counter or regulated or what?

Know it All:  Can't you remember this stuff.  I get tired of repeating it.  
Certain kinds of All commodity options are regulated and certain kinds 
aren't. Can't you just get that once and for all?

Tormented:  No.  I've got optionality dislexia.  What kind of option is How 
are options regulated?  I see our traders doing options all the time and we 
just write them up in our confirmation letters.  There's no big deal about 
CFTC or regulation.  What's the problem?

Know it All:  Well its like this:  if it is an option to do a futures 
contract it has to be done on the Exchange.  Any other options are off 
exchange.  It's just that simple.  Off exchange commodity options can only be 
done if the offeree (that's the guy receiving the offer) is a commercial 
user, producer, processor or merchant handling the underlying commodity.

Tormented:  Hmmm.  I'll have to think about that.

Scott:

I have a call scheduled with Martin for tomorrow morning to discuss these 
CFTC  issues.  I'll let you know how it goes.

I have also not forgotten your request for my view on Martin's tenure in 
Houston.  I have mixed feelings that are difficult to put down in writing and 
I'm hoping we can take a few minutes in New Orleans to discuss.

MarkSorry about the previous message (re: bankruptcy legislation).  Please 
ignore.The alternatives are a net worth of US$1,000,000 or that all trades be 
guaranteed by an entity that meets the financial requirements.

Subject: Re: Derivatives provisions in Bankruptcy Reform legislation  

Mark:
I spoke with Jeff about this today and will take a look at what they've 
done.  From what I have seen thus far, it looks as if they have attempted to 
deal with the setoff issue by revising the definitions of swap agreement, 
securities contract and  forward contract  and creating a new defintion 
called "masternetting agreement".  Is it worth having one of our outside 
firms look at these bills?
Carol

Martin:

Mark H. has asked me to participate in another conference call scheduled for 
9:00 a.m. Houston time tomorrow which will almost certainly last at least an 
hour and possibly more.  If you think 30 minutes will be enough, I wonder if

Subject: Proposed Bankruptcy Amendments

Jeff:
I have reviewed the House and Senate versions of the proposed bankruptcy code 
amendments as they pertain to derivatives and discussed them with Mark Taylor 
this morning and here is our read on what they have done and the effect on 
Enron :

1) Both versions added a concept of "master netting agreement" as a new 
definition and as an add-on to the definitions of forward contract, swap 
agreement, repo agreement  and securities contract..  This definition, I 
believe, describes agreements like the ISDA Master  Agreement.

2) Both versions amend Section 362(b) (the exceptions to the automatic stay) 
to provide for a concept that permits setoffs with respect to amounts due and 
claims under one or more master netting agreements or any contract or 
agreement that is subject to such master netting agreements.  Mark and I 
think that through this provsion, cross-product netting would be permitted to 
the extent our physical and financial contracts separately or collectively 
come under a master netting agreement.  We wanted to confirm that that was 
the intent of this language since it is not entirely clear from the drafted 
language how this would work if for example we had separate netting 
agreements for our physical and financial contracts.  In addition, as 
currently drafted, the only caveat to this setoff right is that these rights 
are derivative of the setoff rights that are permitted by Sections 362 (b) 6 
(forward contarcts), 7 (repos) and 17 (swaps) with respect to each individual 
contract.    This may still present some problems for us in that no 
amendments were made to Section 362 (b) 6 which permits setoffs with respect 
to forward contracts but only to the extent that our claim against the debtor 
is for a margin payment or a settlement payment .  We were hoping to see an 
amendment to this Section that  broadened this language to include any type 
of payment that would be due from the debtor under a forward contract  since 
we are still unclear as to what a "settlement" payment means.  If you look at 
Section 362 (b) 17 which deals with swaps, this language is much broader and 
it was our hope that the setoff language for forward contracts could track 
the setoff language for swaps.  Also, we were hoping that the setoff language 
for forward contarcts would apply to anyone taht was a party to a forward 
contract and not just "forward contract merchants" as currently drafted.  
Again, the swap setoff language has a concept of "swap participant" that is 
much broader.

3) Finally, we like the fact that the definition of "swap agreement" was 
expanded, but are concerned with the new language and how it would apply to 
our newer products such as weather derivatives since in order to fit within 
the new definition, it must be something that is currently or in the future 
"regularly" entered into in the swap market.  There are some further 
revisions to that definition which I want to discuss with you as well.

In summary, while this language gives us some stronger argumants with respect 
to "cross-product" netting, we feel that it doesn't go far enough.  Mark has 
called Cadwalader to get their read on the draft language.  Call me when 
convenient so that we can discuss what the next step for us may be.

Carol

 
Thank you both for the very quick turn-around.   Yes, I agree and hope that 
OM will consent to the proposed changes.

Subject: OMnet, etc.

With reference to your fax of 21 April, 1999 as to the enforceability of 
certain agreements under Swedish law, please receive the following comments:

The relevant agreements are actionable in accordance with their respective 
terms.  Please note, however, that the availibilty in Swedish courts of 
equitable remedies such as injuction and specific performance is restricted 
under Swedish law.  The general remedy in the case of breach of contract is 
damages.

Generally speaking, a Swedish judge would not be inclined to consider matters 
of fairness or reasonability in respect of a Swedish law contract between 
commercial parties such as ECT and OM.  In the case of ambiguity, the court 
would try to establish the intention of the parties using different means of 
contract construction.  If ECT wishes to ascertain strict reliance on the 
contract terms and framework, any court discretion could be limited further 
by way of imposing an 'entire contract clause'. 

Om's disclaimers for liability are fairly aggressive, but I assume that this 
is not uncommon in these type supply & services agreements.  I cannot judge 
to what extent ECT risks incurring any liability towards OM.

The relevant Arbitration Act should be referred to as "(1929:145)".  More 
importantly, this Act  (enacted in 1929) is expected to be replaced by new 
legislation for ad hoc arbitration.  I believe that a bill for the purpose 
has been released by the Government.  I'm not yet acquainted with the 
contents of the bill, but even if I dare say that the new arbitration 
provisions are likely to be moderns and OK you may wish, rather sailing into 
unknown waters, to propose to OM arbitration in accordance with the Rules of 
the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.  I have no 
personal experience of this institute but ECT has done some due diligence on 
it (please see Vinge's response to the attached questionnaire), we refer to 
it in our physical Swedish contracts and it has a solid reputation in the 
world of international arbitration.  Below follows its own recommended 
arbitration clause: 

"Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with [this 
contract], or the breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be settled 
by arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration Institute of the 
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of ........................... 
arbitrators/a sole arbitrator.

The place of the arbitration shall be ....................................

The language(s) to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be 
..................................."

If this is the preferred solution, this clause should be reflected in all 
agreements (and I doubt that OM would reject to it).

Please check the address details of OM Gruppen AB (I believe the details may 
have changed to 'Norrlandsgatan 31
105 78 Stockholm'.).

Heather:

Here is an excerpt from a message in which Anita Fam replies to my inquiry:

Only 3 types of institutions have the capacity and authority to enter into 
derivatives transactions in the PRC.  They are:
a. banks;
b. non-bank financial institutions ("NBFI"); and
c. foreign invested enterprises ("FIE").

Banks and NBFIs require banking licences and may only enter into derivative 
transactions for hedging purposes.  FIEs comprise (i) wholly foreign owned 
enterprises ("WFOE"); and (ii) sino-foreign owned joint ventures ("SFJV") and 
include foreign banks, foreign finance companies and bank branches . There 
are no specific restrictions for WFOEs but SFJVs may only enter into 
derivative transactions for hedging purposes as well.    State-owned 
enterprises and collectively-owned enterprises  can therefore only transact 
through a duly authorised bank or NBFI.  So it looks as if China National Oil 
Company (Corp.?) and China State Power Corp. do not have the capacity nor the 
authority to enter into derivative transactions themselves in the PRC.

I have also found a copy of the results of some legal research we had done a 
year or two ago on these issues.  If you or Cynthia would like to see it I'd 
be happy to send a copy on.Hey Jeff:

I just saw your email address on the Monmouth web site.  I didn't realized 
you were at Mayer Brown.  I don't even know if we've talked since I left New 
York (almost 5 years ago).  I'm now in the legal department at Enron Capital 
& Trade Resources in Houston where my group is responsible for the legal 
issues in derivatives trading here.  I don't get to Chicago often but if they 
ever send you down this way, be sure to look me up!

Alan, this e-mail confirms our discussion earlier today in which you
gave clearance to Sutherland Asbill & Brennan to represent another
existing firm client, Procter & Gamble (*P&G*), with respect to a put
swaption for Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft that Procter & Gamble
wishes to enter with Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  You
clearance on behalf of ECT is based upon my description of what
Sutherland has been asked to do by P&G, which is to review the ISDA
documentation, provide comments and negotiate with ECT, if necessary.
We understand that ECT*s clearance given to Sutherland to work for P&G
on this matter is for the specific transaction only.  Moreover, we
assure you that if ECT and P&G do enter into the swaption and a
dispute between the parties arises related to the swaption, Sutherland
would not represent either party with respect to such dispute
regardless of forum.

Please let me know whether you have any other questions regarding this

Alan, this e-mail confirms our discussion earlier today in which you
gave clearance to Sutherland Asbill & Brennan to represent another
existing firm client, Procter & Gamble (*P&G*), with respect to a put
swaption for Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft that Procter & Gamble
wishes to enter with Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  You
clearance on behalf of ECT is based upon my description of what
Sutherland has been asked to do by P&G, which is to review the ISDA
documentation, provide comments and negotiate with ECT, if necessary.
We understand that ECT*s clearance given to Sutherland to work for P&G
on this matter is for the specific transaction only.  Moreover, we
assure you that if ECT and P&G do enter into the swaption and a
dispute between the parties arises related to the swaption, Sutherland
would not represent either party with respect to such dispute
regardless of forum.

Please let me know whether you have any other questions regarding this
matter.  We appreciate ECT*s willingness to accommodate Sutherland in
this matter, and continue to value our relationship with Enron. 




Torrey:

I am the lawyer in ECT legal responsible for our relationship with the NYMEX 
and monitoring our compliance with NYMEX position limits.  Phillipe Travis 
tells me you may be able to help him in preparing the reports of our 
positions with the option delta factored in.  Thanks very much for your 
assistance.

MarkWow - that is one nasty looking storm out there - I wish I'd gotten in early 
enough to get a covered parking spot.  Oh well, may sufficient hail storm 
damage will get me a new car!

How would you like to deal with the Astros ticets?  I have a couple of 
meetings scheduled but am pretty flexible today - maybe lunch time or when 
you're ready to leave for the day?  Just let me know.  Call if you want -

Shari Stack and I are proud to announce that we have finally received the 
executed ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border) dated as of 
September 2, 1997 between ECT and Coral Energy, L.P.   Copies will be 
distributed.

Mark:

I am concerned about committing to the development of legal risk books using 
a VAR-like analysis since our attempts in this direction a couple of years 
ago failed (Bob Williams and I worked on that project).  Many of the risks 
that were identifiable did not lend themselves to the numeric analysis so 
near to the commercial guys' hearts and the numbers we came up with were 
close to meaningless.

If you want a technical example of a legal risk in our financial trading 
contracts, you could use either (i) the statute of frauds (deals of more than 
one year in length may be unenforceable if the confirm isn't signed) or (ii) 
the widespread use of multiple "Omnibus" short-form contracts for trades 
before a master agreement is executed (resulting in many transactions where 
netting in bankruptcy has not been tested in court).  Item (i) could be fixed 
with legislation (as it has in New York).  Item (ii) could be reduced if the 
traders/dealmakers were willing to put pressure on their customers to sign 
master agreements.

I like the idea of emphasizing the need for buy-in from the commercial side 
in the contract negotiation/formation process.  That buy-in needs to be at 
all levels and it will only happen with the line folks if they get it from 
the top.

Mark T.I will probably go straight to the game from here so won't leave til 6:30 or 
7:00.  Why don't you give me a call this afternoon - say around 3:00 or 3:30

ARBINET COMMUNICATIONS INTRODUCES ON-LINE
 TRADING OF BANDWIDTH DERIVATIVES BUSINESS
 EDITORS/TECHNOLOGY WRITERS SAN
 DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MAY 11, 1999--ARBINET
 COMMUNICATIONS, INC., THE WORLD'S 
 [Business Wire ? Rcvd: May 11, 08:08 AM EDT ] 



BW0167 MAY 11,1999 5:09 PACIFIC 8:09 EASTERN 

( BW)(CA-ARBINET-COMMUNICATIONS) Arbinet Communications Introduces On-Line 
Trading of Bandwidth
Derivatives 

Business Editors/Technology Writers 

SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 11, 1999--Arbinet Communications, Inc., the 
world's leading trading network for
telecommunications capacity, will inaugurate Internet trading of forwards and 
options in telecommunications bandwidth later this
month. 

Trading in the bandwidth derivatives is being facilitated through Arbinet's 
access-controlled website where buyers and sellers
can post prices anonymously. Execution occurs offline, subject to a screening 
process for credit, documentation and
interoperability issues. The announcement was made at the TRA Conference, 
Booth No. 1004. 

As a second phase of the project, Arbinet is developing a physically settled 
derivative product that will allow anonymous
web-based execution, culminating in delivery to Arbinet switching hubs. 
Implementation of this product is an extension of
Arbinet's physically settled minutes trading system, the Arbinet Global 
Clearing Network(TM) (AGCN(TM)). 

Forward and option derivative trading in bandwidth provides distinct 
advantages for clients who wish to hedge their exposure
to future moves in the price of capacity. Furthermore, it provides a level 
playing field where even small operators can realize the
pricing advantages which were, until recently, available only to large 
incumbent telecommunications carriers. Buyers and sellers
can manage risk allowing them to better plan for the future. 

Sellers of the forward contract can be natural suppliers of capacity such as 
submarine cable operators. Buyers can be natural
consumers (e.g. Internet Service Providers and Competitive Local Exchange 
Carriers) or speculators. 

"Arbinet aims to be the premier provider of risk-management solutions for the 
bandwidth market," said U. Kanad Chakrabarti,
vice president of Bandwidth Trading, Arbinet. "As a non-proprietary player, 
we can offer impartial execution for our clients,
which is important in a non-transparent and illiquid market like this." 

All bandwidth contracts will be posted on Arbinet's bandwidth trading site, 
www.ebandwidth.net, beginning May 21, 1999.
The forward contract allows buyers and sellers to reserve transmission 
capacity. The option contract allows buyers and sellers
to realize the optionality value present in the bandwidth market, but 
currently not fully priced by telecommunications players. 

"We provide customers with a service not offered by any other on-line trading 
company," said Alex Mashinsky, chairman and
founder, Arbinet. "Of key importance, we don't trade for ourselves, which 
gives us complete objectivity in trade execution. 

"This new service is a natural outgrowth of our experience in trading telecom 
minutes on behalf of international and multinational
telecommunications carriers." 

For more information, contact U. Kanad Chakrabarti at (212) 230-1200 or via 
e-mail at kchakrabarti@arbinet.com. 

Arbinet (www.arbinet.com) is the world's leading Internet trading exchange 
and switch-based clearing network for global
telecommunications capacity. Arbinet routed over 174 million minutes for 
international carriers in 1998, which it estimates
represented over 80% of all exchange-traded minutes traffic for that year. 
The Arbinet Global Clearing Network is presently
clearing and settling minutes for all types of communications companies 
including Internet Telephony Service Providers and
major carriers. Founded in 1994, the company has 52 employees and is 
headquartered in New York with offices in Tokyo,
Sao Paulo, and Hong Kong. AGCN was recently awarded Internet Telephony 
magazine's prestigious Editor's Choice Award
for 1999.

Mark -

I think you are right - this is no doubt the best we can do.  Let's go ahead 
and take care of execution.

Thanks very much for all your help.

MarkLet me add my thanks for your willingness to sign these things for us.  The 
guys in London never think about lining up a signatory in Houston ahead of 
time who might actually know something about what they're signing and why 
they're signing it.

Any chance you'll be in NY Monday night?  I'm taking a few people to dinner & 
you might enjoy it.

We received all outstanding documentation overnight from Houston. The Enron 
amendments to the financing will become effective today. This then clears the 
way for the banks to syndicate which will happen on Monday morning at a 
signing at A&O.

It only remains for ETOL (David or Treasa) to sign the syndication agreement 
which will be couriered here today for that purpose.

This will mean there will be nothing outstanding for any Enron entity to sign 
on Monday. It may however be politic to have an Enron presence at the signing 
on Monday to meet the banks. I will leave Gonzalo to coordinate that with Nat 
West. 

Thank you to everyone in Houston who scuttled around getting documents signed 
for us. Your efforts are appreciated.

Subject: Legal Issus with Hypertext Links

As Louise mentioned briefly in today's meeting, we need to obtain a view on 
the legal implications of  "linking" web pages and the news and information 
they contain.  Some specific issues we will need a perspective on include:

1) Legal issues associated with providing hypertext links to:
 -  3rd party websites (avoiding unauthorized links such as in the Shetland 
Times case in the UK). These sites may include other
    interesting energy sites
 -  links to news items (external URL sites), etc.. Is mutual consent enough? 
What are the liability issues? 

2) The flipside: Potentially allowing linking of our Enron Online site onto 
websites of third parties, (e.g. in the form of click of simple hyperlinks or 
through  "banner ads" which would take users from the external site,  such as 
an FT.com, and bring them to our site as a marketing tool).    

*3) Issue of Publishing/Re-distributing/Re-purposing news or other business 
information from other sources
    (e.g. E-Trade shows Reuters news - what sort of legal agreement are they 
likely to have in place on a global basis?)
    (e.g. Coral Energy - have an up-to-the-minute energy news presence with 
all stories footnoted as "copyright 1999 by FWN" - presumably another 
external news agency). 

Most of the above relates to our plans for a "News Viewer" and "Links Page" 
which would encompass both :
i) publishing Enron commodity-related news to external (and internal) users.
ii) displaying/re-distributing commodity news provided by an external agency 
(e.g. Reuters, etc.) to external and internal users.

How do we satisfy the copyright requirements of others (i), and ensure we get 
full copyright protection for our own news (ii) given that all of the above 
will likely be viewable globally  ?

4)  As discussed today, providing multiple hypertext links to GTCs .  
Although it would be far more preferable to automatically personalize the 
site such that only legal information relevant to that customer is seen, as a 
fall back option, would there be any issues showing the multiple links (i.e. 
would users know which GTCs applied to them if bombarded with various 
options).

A year ago, we looked at a proposal from Guam asking for help w/ price risk 
management on their fuel oil purchases.  We concluded then that Guam was 
really looking for an advisor, so we declined to participate in their 
tender.  Goldman, Sachs apparently won that bid.  Now, however, it looks like 
they're interested in the products we have to offer, so the EI people would 
like to send the attached letter (all the way at the bottom of these notes) 
to be sure Enron is invited to the table.  The draft letter seems harmless 
enough, but I thought that the person in your group who will be supporting 
this effort might like to review it before it's sent.  The letter is set up 
for Kevin Beasley's signature, but the ECT organization has changed since 
then, so I can look into who that would be at this point.

I would appreciate it if you could copy me on your responses to the EI folks, 
so I can keep up w/ them. Thanks for your help.

Team:

Please review and finalize the attached draft to GEDA.  I spoke with Lisa 
Taitano of GEDA today and she indicated that GEDA or GPA may bid out a 
financial risk management contract around next month.  However, Goldman 
Sachs, who is currently the risk manager, also appears to be manipulating the 
process such that it would transition from a risk manager to the provider of 
the financial products--which would explain the third paragraph in the 
attached draft.

Goldman Sachs is saying that they would forfeit the fees associated
with their role as a risk manager in exchange for negotiating the financial 
risk management contract.

Best regards,
Manuel

Subject: UK Financial Services Regulation

The FSA (Financial Services Authority) recently published for the first time 
details of the exemptions from regulation which will be available under the 
legislation replacing the current Financial Services Act 1986 (the "Act"). 

As you know, ECTRIC is currently an unregulated booking company for our 
European financial trading business. As such, ECTRIC is not required to 
maintain what would otherwise be significant regulatory capital and is not 
subject to conduct of business rules. ECTRIC's status as an unregulated 
entity rests on exemptions which available under the Act. It is clearly 
important that equivalent exemptions are available to ECTRIC (and to the new 
US booking entity under the proposed reorg) under the replacement 
legislation.

From an initial view, the existing exemptions we rely upon will be available 
under the new regime.  However, the "devil's in the detail" and so I am 
working through the exemptions in detail with Slaughter and May.

Please give me a call on x6566 if you would like to discuss this area.

Christian,

I'm afraid you may have your centuries confused relative to Nelson and the 
Armada.  The "Spanish Armada" of fame was a fleet dispatched by Philip II of 
Spain to invade England in the late 16th century - it was during Elizabeth 
I's reign and I have some vague recollection that Mary, Queen of Scots had 
something to do with encouraging Philip before she was executed.  The Armada 
was defeated in a series of battles (and by some very bad weather) around the 
English Channel.  Nelson didn't sail til the 18th century.  Of course, the 
English and the Spanish had been going at it off and on the entire time and 
you'd have to say "on" in the early 1800's  when Nelson "broke the enemy 
line" at the battle of Trafalgar.  I believe that was during a time when the 
Spanish were allies of Napoleon - whether by choice or under duress I 
couldn't say - and the enemy fleet was a combined French/Spanish fleet.  The 
battle is named after Cape Trafalgar in southern Spain.  I'm pretty sure it's 
somewhere between Cadiz and Gibraltar so your gut feeling is right - I don't 
see it on the map either & wonder if it has a different name in Spanish.  
Will you be going to that part of Spain[Andalusia?]?  The English victory has 
in common with the Armada battle of a bit over 200 years earlier that it 
ended any hopes held by the enemy of imminent invasion of Britain.

As far as the policy question goes, you are remembering what I always 
referred to as the "trading policy" but is officially referred to as the 
"Risk Management Policy."  It most definitely covers Portland trading 
operations.  I haven't been as involved in that policy for the last couple of 
years as I was back when MEH was chief control officer.  Ted Murphy now has 
responsibility for maintaining and enforcing the policy.  I don't have a 
current version but will ask Ted for one.

Subject: Trading Limits

Mark,  
I haven't had a chance to plunge into the book you lent  me at the conference 
because I am flailing around wildly in  as much as I can about certain 
Spanish topics before early July, including such things as, of course,   
Cervantes, a man whose mind I have come to love almost as much as 
Shakespeare's, the  Catalans,  the Spanish Civil War, the War of Spanish 
Succession, the Spanish Inquisition and of course the Spanish Aramada.  I 
have never read a definitive account of that great moment in English naval 
history.  Did Nelson fight in the Armada battle at Trafalgar? Is that the 
battle Jack Aubrey is always talking about?     Where the hell is Trafalgar?  
I have the idea it is down there by Gibraltar but can't find it on the map.  
On the other hand, I have a vague fantasy of these little row boats coming 
out at the mouth of the Thames to battle the mighty Armada.   When one 
considers  what the panic must have been like in the Spanish fleet when they 
realized that in spite of their size and assumed invincibility they were 
actually vulnerable to that old maritime risk of sinking, one is 
involuntarily  caused to cast one's badly  jaundiced commercial-legal  mind 
upon  recent events of an analagous nature on board our own beloved ship,  
sailing as it has been  in the northern  commercial straits.   Has our  
mighty Armada sailed out onto the seas of deregulation, only to meet the 
......   perhaps I shall cease articulating  this line of thought and dwell 
upon the ingenuity of the Engish.   

Anyway,  I have come to a point here in Portland  where I need to go back 
into the policy context of our trading business.  I recall in Houston that  
we had these trading policies that you worked on and that they set limits and 
articulated responsibilities.  Do you still have close contact with those 
policies and if so, is there a discrete document that pertains to the 
Portland desk and if so would you be so kind as to send me a hard copy of 
it?  I want to ground myself again in the fundamentals so my daily battles 
can be a little more fun.  --cgy

Subject: Re: Access and Trading Agreements  

Good morning everyone,

Thankyou for responding promptly.

I think this draft better captures the Master / GTC approach though I thought 
we were going to change the title of the Internete Trading Access Agreement 
to something reflecting 'Password Application'.  

Also the wording which has been added at the end of the agreement is 
obviously only US specific - does this mean that we are going to have to have 
different Agreements on the page depending on the location of the person who 
clicks on it? Obviously the fact that the law is different on the written one 
is OK as can be altered by jurisdiction but the same issue does arise on the 
online agreement.   This causes issues so I'll need a respond immediately on 
this and would appreciate Mark and Justin discussing this today.

For information, I attach Schwab's agreement from the web which is quite 
simplistic in look and feel - could we adopt any of this approach - no 
WHEREAS is a good start.




Regards

Louise

Just a thought:  I'm assuming it will be too difficult to build in customized 
credit provisions on a counterparty by counterparty basis on-line - but if 
there are master agreements in place, the  credit provisions contained in 
them would apply to on-line trades.  The availability of the on-line system 
may therefore encourage more master agreements since the Credit Dept. will 
limit a counterparty's trading volume until credit terms can be imposed.I have not yet had a chance to read this but thought I should pass it along 
asap.

Subject: Internet Trading - Internet Trading Access and Electronic Trading  
Agreements




Further to our meeting yesterday, please find attached a copy of the
Internet Trading Access Agreement ("ITAA") and the Electronic Trading
Agreement ("ETA") marked up with my suggested changes from an English law
perspective.  As I mentioned to you yesterday, these documents will also
need to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are any
overriding local laws which could impact on the use.  The overseas lawyers
have copies of these agreements and will include this in their report.

I understand that it is envisaged that the ITAA will be signed off line and
the ETA will be posted on the Website.  Each person authorised by a
counterparty with a password must "click through" the Agreement before
commencing trading.  This will only be done on one occasion.

We discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach, namely, that
a counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the ITAA it was
not aware of the terms of the ETA and therefore, could not be bound by it.
It is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the ETA are
enforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities, limitations
of liability etc.  Having said that, the view might be taken that by
entering into the ITAA all that has been achieved is that a counterparty
receives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in a
position where it must consider the ETA before proceeding.  Once the
counterparty accesses the Website and sees the ETA a second contract is made
and the ITAA and ETA must then be read together but only at the time that
the counterparty has clicked through the ETA.  I suspect that this is the
approach that Sullivan & Cromwell had in mind.  It is also worth bearing in
mind that a counterparty may ask for the ETA at the time of entering into
the ITAA or may be relunctant to click through the ETA until they have had
internal legal sign off.  This may delay trading.

Nonetheless, I understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the ITAA
off line and the ETA on line and accordingly, the attached documents are
marked up with that structure in mind.  As agreed yesterday, I have only
made changes to the document produced by Sullivan & Cromwell where I think
it is necessary for English law purposes or clarification.  I have the
following brief comments on the changes I have made:

1. Parties:  You will see that both documents are entered into by a
designated
 Enron entity for itself and on behalf of all Enron group
undertakings.  The reason
 for this is that Transactions will actually be made between the
counterparty and
 various different Enron entities.  We therefore need to ensure that
such Transactions
 with each of those Enron entities are governed by the terms of these
documents.
 I note from your e-mail yesterday that it was suggested that we need
to list the affiliates
 or have one entity enter into the Transactions.  I think there may
be some confusion here.
 This is not the case.  I assume that the current Enron entities
which trade certain
 commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so on
the Website.
 The Website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve this
but I assume that this
 causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages on
the Website depending
 on what password has been inserted.  The documents now contemplate
this.

2. "Services":  I have removed the references to Services as I am not
sure what this means.
 I would have thought that these agreements need to govern the
counterparty's access and
 utilization of the Website whether or not they actually carry out
any Transactions.  Therefore,
 I believe that where the Agreement had previously referred to
Services, it can now refer to
 "access and utilization of" the Website.

3. Contract Formation:  I have inserted a short paragraph in Clause 3
of the ETA which
 provides that a Transaction will only be executed once Enron
generates a message of
 confirmation of the sale and purchase to a Counterparty and that any
electronic records
 of Enron will prevail.  I note that Sullivan & Cromwell envisage a
document being attached
 which explains this.  This is also acceptable.

4. Data Protection:  On reflection, it will be more appropriate for
relevant data protection
 wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA.
This is because the
 data protection concerns revolve around data subjects i.e. living
individuals, rather than
 corporate entities such as the Counterparty.  Before providing
appropriate wording for
 this, could you please let me know what information will be
collected by you concerning
 living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally.  For
example, when a password is
 entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this or
can you intentionally or
 unintentionally obtain that individual's e-mail address or other
information on them once
 they have entered the Site.  You will need to check this with your
technical people.

Once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have your
comments.

I have simultaneously sent this e-mail to my financial regulatory colleagues
for their review.  They may have further comments which we will send onto
you as a matter of urgency.

Kind regards

Andrew Wilkinson

internal legal sign off.  This may delay trading.

Nonetheless, I understand that you are keen to proceed with signing the ITAA
off line and the ETA on line and accordingly, the attached documents are
marked up with that structure in mind.  As agreed yesterday, I have only
made changes to the document produced by Sullivan & Cromwell where I think
it is necessary for English law purposes or clarification.  I have the
following brief comments on the changes I have made:

1. Parties:  You will see that both documents are entered into by a
designated
 Enron entity for itself and on behalf of all Enron group
undertakings.  The reason
 for this is that Transactions will actually be made between the
counterparty and
 various different Enron entities.  We therefore need to ensure that
such Transactions
 with each of those Enron entities are governed by the terms of these
documents.
 I note from your e-mail yesterday that it was suggested that we need
to list the affiliates
 or have one entity enter into the Transactions.  I think there may
be some confusion here.
 This is not the case.  I assume that the current Enron entities
which trade certain
 commodities with certain counterparties will continue to do so on
the Website.
 The Website will need to be set up in such a way as to achieve this
but I assume that this
 causes no problem as each counterparty will see different pages on
the Website depending
 on what password has been inserted.  The documents now contemplate
this.

2. "Services":  I have removed the references to Services as I am not
sure what this means.
 I would have thought that these agreements need to govern the
counterparty's access and
 utilization of the Website whether or not they actually carry out
any Transactions.  Therefore,
 I believe that where the Agreement had previously referred to
Services, it can now refer to
 "access and utilization of" the Website.

3. Contract Formation:  I have inserted a short paragraph in Clause 3
of the ETA which
 provides that a Transaction will only be executed once Enron
generates a message of
 confirmation of the sale and purchase to a Counterparty and that any
electronic records
 of Enron will prevail.  I note that Sullivan & Cromwell envisage a
document being attached
 which explains this.  This is also acceptable.

4. Data Protection:  On reflection, it will be more appropriate for
relevant data protection
 wording to be on the Website itself rather than in the ITAA or ETA.
This is because the
 data protection concerns revolve around data subjects i.e. living
individuals, rather than
 corporate entities such as the Counterparty.  Before providing
appropriate wording for
 this, could you please let me know what information will be
collected by you concerning
 living individuals either intentionally or unintentionally.  For
example, when a password is
 entered will you be able to identify a living individual by this or
can you intentionally or
 unintentionally obtain that individual's e-mail address or other
information on them once
 they have entered the Site.  You will need to check this with your
technical people.

Once you have had a chance to review this perhaps you could let me have your
comments.

I have simultaneously sent this e-mail to my financial regulatory colleagues
for their review.  They may have further comments which we will send onto
you as a matter of urgency.

Western Power Market Stands 'Poised on the 
Precipice' According to the ICF Kaiser Consulting
Group's 1999 Bulk Power Outlook

FAIRFAX, Va., June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Power markets in the Western System 
Coordinating Council are ``poised on the
precipice'' of capacity shortfalls and extreme price volatility this summer 
and next, according to a new study of the regional
market by the Energy Practice of the ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``The West 
stands at least a one in three chance of
experiencing price spikes similar to those seen in the Midwest market during 
the summer of 1998,'' said Judah Rose, a Senior
Vice President with the Group and the director of the ICF study.

ICF's analysis of the West points to a number of key near-term implications: 

     Regional Capacity Deficits. The region is in a delicate supply/demand 
balance, with most sub-regions of the West relying
     on a capacity surplus in the Pacific Northwest to meet near-term peak 
capacity requirements. Because demand growth is
     outpacing new supply additions, those deficits will only become more 
extreme over the next two years.
     Volatility Exacerbated by Hydroelectric Dependence. A fifth consecutive 
year of above-average hydroelectric generation
     -- the principle cause of the Pacific Northwest surplus -- will again 
mask the West's precarious supply/demand balance in
     1999. However, if the drought conditions of the early 1990s resurface, 
the West will find itself at an even greater risk of
     price spikes.
     Upward Pressure on Prices. Prices are on an upward trend for 1999 and 
2000, the result of both higher regional spot
     natural gas prices and the increasing value of ``pure capacity'' -- the 
value of ensuring reliability for consumers. 

The study also evaluates the long-term future of the Western market and 
highlights the following key results: 

     Capacity Requirements Growing Steadily. The region's underlying demand 
growth is strong, creating a long-term regional
     capacity need totaling more than 18,000 MW by 2005, unless there is a 
serious economic downturn in the region.
     Energy Prices Trending Downward. The trend for long-term energy prices 
is for negative real growth through 2010, but
     the region will remain susceptible to near-term volatility while market 
institutions continue to evolve and new supply is
     slowly added over the next few years.
     Capacity Prices Rising Slowly. Current low capacity values will continue 
to rise (but still remain below many other
     regions) as new, more efficient generation is added.
     Strong Gas Demand Growth at Stable Prices. Gas demand for power 
generation is poised to more than double by 2010,
     with the most explosive growth in the Rocky Mountain and Southwest 
subregions. Even so, the West region's vast gas
     supply potential appears capable of meeting this growth with little, if 
any, real price appreciation through 2010. 

``The Western U.S. Region volume of our Bulk Power Outlook, along with the 
other five regional volumes, offers
comprehensive insights into the rapidly changing North American power 
markets,'' said Sudhakar Kesavan, President of the
ICF Kaiser Consulting Group. ``No other firm can match our analytic 
capabilities -- which are based on an understanding of the
fundamentals driving electric power markets -- and the knowledge gained from 
working one- on-one with the market's key
players.''

I note that the ETA has been revised to include a paragraph which provides 
that Enron's electronic records will prevail over a signed confirmation.  Is 
that how we want this to work?  In the telephone trading context we assume 
that the executed confirmation will control over the oral conversation, even 
when we have a recording of the conversation.

Subject: Internet Trading - Internet Trading Access and Electronic Trading  
Agreements




Further to our meeting yesterday, please find attached a copy of the
Internet Trading Access Agreement ("ITAA") and the Electronic Trading
Agreement ("ETA") marked up with my suggested changes from an English law
perspective.  As I mentioned to you yesterday, these documents will also
need to be considered by the overseas lawyers to see whether there are any
overriding local laws which could impact on the use.  The overseas lawyers
have copies of these agreements and will include this in their report.

I understand that it is envisaged that the ITAA will be signed off line and
the ETA will be posted on the Website.  Each person authorised by a
counterparty with a password must "click through" the Agreement before
commencing trading.  This will only be done on one occasion.

We discussed yesterday the risks associated with this approach, namely, that
a counterparty could claim that at the time of entering into the ITAA it was
not aware of the terms of the ETA and therefore, could not be bound by it.
It is clearly important to have certainty that the terms of the ETA are
enforceable as they contain important terms such as indemnities, limitations
of liability etc.  Having said that, the view might be taken that by
entering into the ITAA all that has been achieved is that a counterparty
receives a password which enable the counterparty to put itself in a
position where it must consider the ETA before proceeding.  Once the
counterparty accesses the Website and sees the ETA a second contract is made
and the ITAA and ETA must then be read together but only at the time that
the counterparty has clicked through the ETA.  I suspect that this is the
approach that Sullivan & Cromwell had in mind.  It is also worth bearing in
mind that a counterparty may ask for the ETA at the time of entering into
the ITAA or may be relunctant to click through the ETA until they have had
internal legal sign off.  This may delay trading.

Lake and I stayed around the hotel using the gym and getting a massage.  Good 
food, too.  The only downer was the drive.  Cynthia:

As you know, the Bankruptcy Code revisions never made it through the recent 
Congress.  I understand they bogged down in the final days over issues which 
were essentially irrelevant to us in ECT.   I'm not sure you are aware of the 
importance to our trading business of certain of the other proposed 
revisions.  We anticipate that the revisions will be reintroduced in the next 
Congress and are beginning to think about ways that we can influence the 
outcome this time around.  Are you the right person in your shop for us to 
talk to about this?  If you could let me know, I'd appreciate it.

Thanks,

Our meeting for this morning will have to be canceled due to scheduling

third Wednesdays at 10:00) in the future for our group meetings.
Richard Sanders has asked us to revise the arbitration language in our forms 
- including the Omnibus Annex A.  Please give some thought to whether there 
are any other revisions we should make at this time.  We make every effort to 
minimize the frequency with which we change the Annex (it has only been 
changed once since its inception) so it is important that we get as many 
necessary changes made at this time as possible.

MarkI currently have a 28800 modem but would like to get the fastest (within 
reason) modem we have available for a Compaq LTE 5280.  Please let me know if 
this is the kind of thing I can get by Friday since I leave for London Friday 
afternoon and would like to take the computer (complete with modem) with me.  
If the new modem is not available in that time frame, I at least need a new 
pigtail for the existing card since the old one is broken.

Thanks and please charge 413/1157.

Hi Marc - 

I just got back from London last night.  Looks like our IT people found out 
about this yesterday too - don't know if it hit us or not but they made 
everybody log off & back on again during the day yesterday - I'm assuming 
that was to install a new virus shield.  Didn't affect me since I wasn't here 
anyway. 

 How've you been?

We're home this weekend - might go sailing (you're welcome to come if you 
want) but nothing big planned.  I'm in NYC next Wed - Sun., T's in a swim 
meet in Atlanta next weekend, NYC after that.  Nothing planned for the 26/27 
weekend & still toying with the idea of Seattle for the 4th.Here's a very rough draft of a set of slides we might use.  Let me know if 
this is even close to what you have in mind.  I can have one of our 
paralegals and our graphics dept. fill in whatever we need and make it look 
good tomorrow.

Mark
Attached is the form of schedule to the 1992 ISDA Master Agreement we use for 
purely financial transactions - swaps and options.  There are a large number 
of choices and variables to consider in these documents and usually whenever 
an Enron company begins financial trading in a new jurisdiction we work with 
local counsel to adapt the form and then handle most of the drafting and 
negotiating from here.  To the extent you are interested in using ISDA Master 
Agreements, we will be happy to continue in the same way.  I'm not sure they 
will be much help in constructing the type of physical commodity agreements I 
suspect you need.  If you need the printed form of the ISDA Master that the 
schedule relates to, let me know and I can have it faxed to you.

When the transaction is physical, even if there is an embedded swap or option 
of some kind, we use physical commodity contracts which vary widely from 
commodity to commodity.  I will ask Elizabeth Sager to send you some sample 
electricity forms and Jeff Hodge or Dan Hyvl to send some natural gas forms.  
In a trading context, since Enron may be on either side of one or more 
transactions with the same counterparty, the forms are drafted in a bilateral 
fashion (basically we only ask for thing we are willing to give).  If your 
situation is different (e.g. our transactions with one party involve only the 
purchase of fuel and with another party only selling electricity, dramatic 
changes to these forms might be in order.

With regard to loan/finance transactions, I am not at all familiar with forms 
they use and in fact those transactions may be individualized to the extent 
that they don't even use forms as such.  I will ask Julia Murray to contact 
you or have one of the people in her group get in touch with you to talk 
about those types of transactions.  Unfortunately, I don't know of an 
electronic table of contents to the forms.  There is a project underway to 
create a forms database but it is in the very early stages of thought.

Subject: ECT Forms





When we met in Buenos Aires a couple of months ago, you mentioned that you 
might
be able to provide Robert George and I with some ECT forms that would help us
with our deals in the Southern Cone. Of course these forms would be used as a
guideline and would be adapted as needed to comply with local laws. We would 
be
interested in any electronic copies of any ECT forms where (i) Enron is a 
party
to either side of a physical or financial swap (fuel and/or electric), (ii)
Enron is a party to fuel or electricity supply agreements (interruptible or
firm), (iii) Enron is a party to loan/finance documents, and (iv) Enron is a
party to construction /O&M Agreements.  Equally useful might be an electronic
table of contents to the ECT form books that  Brent mentioned having when I 
was
last in BA.  Thanks much.



I don't remember if I talked to you about this last month or not.  If not, 
would you mind giving Brent a hand with his broker agreement?

Subject: Broker Agreement




I am working on preparing a new form of Broker Agreement for Don.  Is there a 
form that ECT has used in the past?  The version we will be drafting will 
have certain non-traditional obligations on the broker such as the obligation 
to find a seller for the buyer's consumption requirements, guarantee to 
seller the buyers payment obligations and so forth.  Do you think Vicky may 
have prepared broker agreements for EES?  If my description is too vague call
me and I can describe it in more detail.  Thanks.

Sylvia:

I have been unable to reach either Jeff Keeler or Maureen McVicker to talk 
about this today.  I'm a little worried about who is handling the 
Commissioner's itinerary at this point and I don't know if anyone has 
reserved a conference room for the 2:30 meeting.  Fred Lagrasta is now also 
supposed to attend and will have a short presentation to make (I don't know 
if he needs any audio/visual equipment).  Can you check on this - maybe 
somebody else in Jeff Keeler's, Steve Kean's, or maybe even Ken Rice's office 
will know where this is supposed to take place?  It is entirely possible that 
no one has reserved a room yet.  If you could do that and then let the 
attendees know where it will be, I'd appreciate it.  Unfortunately, I'm on my 
way out to the airport now and can't take care of this myself.

Thanks for your help!

		 Subject: Re: Hedge Fund and CTA list

Bob:

Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is 
that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus 
will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents 
before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic 
corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent 
elsewhere.

The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates 
to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term 
Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, 
orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of 
teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of 
messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge 
funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying 
much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past 
and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: 
notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal 
regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to 
speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a 
large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the 
financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.]

For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the 
internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or 
individuals - for similar reasons).  

Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their 
customers just as Brokers cannot.

Harry,

Further to our conversation last week, I have listed below, in two segments, 
the top CTAs who presently manage more than $100mill each, and the top Hedge 
Funds, based upon their likelihood to manage assets in diversified markets, 
that may include tangible commodities. My understanding of EOL is that it 
presently caters primarily to this latter group and offers only tangible 
commodity trading instruments.

As I explained, the principle difference between a Hedge Fund and a CTA 
(Commodity Trading Advisor), is the manner in which they control the assets 
that they are contracted to manage. In the case of a CTA, the money can not 
be held by the CTA itself. The underlying investor will open a clearing 
account with a respective Clearing House, the assets will remain in this 
account and the CTA will trade based on the full monetary value of that 
account - in many cases an investor may well fund this account with Notional 
Funding. NF are 'abstract funds' not actually deposited at the Clearing 
House, but acknowledged as being available should variation or original 
margin be required. The CTA has no control over these funds. All monetary 
transactions must be executed by the Clearing House, and must be authorized 
by the investor. The CTA does have the ability to execute trades at an other 
trading house - such as Enron, through a contractual document called an 
International Uniform Give-Up Agreement. We have quite a few hundred of these 
agreements in NY. Essentially, all parties involved in the execution of a 
trade - the CTA, the Investor, the Executing Broker and the Clearing House, 
agree to allow the CTA to trade wherever he/she wishes and Give-Up that trade 
to the Investor's Clearing House. Since every regulated trade must ultimately 
clear the respective exchange, for a CTA to trade OTC and Swap agreements, 
would require prior notification to an investor that his/her money may be 
required as collateral against such a trade, and would be required to be 
deposited at Enron. A Hedge Fund has greater flexibility to trade such 
instruments since in the majority of instances a Hedge Fund does exert 
control over the funds it manages. A Hedge Fund typically structures its 
investment vehicles as Off-Shore limited partnership funds. As such the Hedge 
fund has direct control over the underlying assets and can move those assets 
to wherever they may be required - if investing via Enron On-Line, it would 
move the assets to Enron, for example.

This first list, below, is comprised of the top flight CTAs :



The following list is of Hedge Funds that I believe are trading Commodities 
and other non-security investments. It is by no means complete ! :



I would be happy to make any introductions that I can to any of the above 
names. Some we know well, others we may have to network ourselves into. 
Caroline and I met a few weeks ago and I passed some names on to her - I am 
not sure where that has got to yet, but if you need any further information 
please call me.

Hi Debbie:

Thanks for your note - it's always nice to hear from MC friends!  

I'm living in Houston and working in the legal department of a large energy 
company (Enron).  I have two main areas of focus: derivatives trading (swaps, 
options, etc.) which I've been doing for over 6 years now and e-commerce 
which is relatively new.  The most fun work project I've had was being the 
lead lawyer in designing and launching our internet commodity trading 
platform about a year ago.  It has been tremendously successful.  While few 
people have ever heard of it, it is the largest (by dollar volume) website in 
the world!

I keep in touch with Mark Kopinski who is managing a couple of international 
mutual funds in New York.  My work takes me there several times a year and I 
usually try to see him if I have some free time.  The college is thinking 
about another capital campaign and he and I were on a preliminary planning 
committee (to see if a campaign makes sense).  Ralph V. was there - whom I 
hadn't seen in years! - and of course I keep in touch with Doc, too.  I was 
on campus for my 20th reunion a couple of years ago.  There were only 2 of us 
from '78 so it wasn't as much fun as I'd hoped but it was still good to see 
familiar faculty faces.  With luck the 25th will draw a bigger crowd.

My Midwest geography isn't what it once was but it sounds like you've got a 
terrible commute.  I hope you're liking your work to justify the drive.  I 
rarely make it back to Chicago but let's keep in touch and definitely let me 
know if you ever make it down this way.

MarkSure - it's not secret.

Generally speaking we have only documented that kind of concern when there 
were separate legal entities involved (like getting a comfort letter or 
guaranty from EI when ECT had to do the swap for one of their deals).  I 
think we can get away with pointing out the issue to both commercial sides.

		 Subject: VPP Vehicle

The VPP swap vehicle is being structured such that if a major adverse 
reservoir event occurs (no gas!) and as a result the Partnership (owned by 
Trust/banks) cannot fund the swap payments, then as swap default occurs and 
if termination payment is owed to ENA, the termination payment will in 
essence be subordinated to the bank loan repayment.  This is clearly a free 
walk on ENA on the swap (ENA in essence wears reservoir risk on the swap).  
If this is the commercial deal, so be it.  However, I am concerned that the 
"$ fallout" in such event be charged internally to the finance originators 
and not the trading arm, but I do not know who to talk to about this.  Any 
ideas?  Or should I assume it resolves itself internally as and when it may 
occur?

Neither Bank of Nova Scotia nor any affiliate of Bank of Nova Scotia should

Why don't you come in Saturday night & I'll take you to dinner?I did get Janet the white top (Interlock turtleneck - Medium, color - white

stores.  I did not get the towels.

Glad the computer is working better for you.  It makes all the difference in 
the world to have it speed up.  For me it actually becomes more useful since 
I cant stand just sitting there staring at it waiting for something to 
happen.  

My paperwhites haven't bloomed yet - I do remember from the last time I grew 
some that the fragrance can be almost overpowering.  I wonder if people grow 
them outdoors when the weather warms up.  The smell might work better with 
more room to disperse.  This time I have six coming up all at once - I hope I 
can stand it!

Subject: E-Commerce

Gentlemen:

In connection with an analysis of the tax issues presented by the E-commerce 
program, it is important that all Enron entities to participate in such 
system (as well the products to be traded by such entities) be compiled.  
London has undertaken this with respect to Europe (and, shortly, Singapore).  
I have undertaken to coordinate this with respect to North America.  Thus, if 
you could send me a list of North American Enron entities to be incorporated 
in the E-commerce program (and the products they will trade) I can then 
undertake to determine what issues such presents.  In this regard, I will 
coordinate with ECT-Legal in North America to verify that the manner such 
entities are to be incorporated into the E-commerce program does not trigger 
unplanned for tax consequences.

In addition, it would be helpful to obtain copies of the form of agreements 
to be entered into by counterparties prior to such parties being granted 
access to the E-commerce system (i.e., the form of on-line access agreements 
and any agreements ancilliary thereto).  These agreements are important to 
the tax analysis of the E-commerce program because the manner such agreements 
are to be entered into may implicate tax nexus concerns that we will want to 
work to mitigate (for example, if it is contemplated that all such on-line 
agreements are to be administratively executed by a single entity 
("Administrative Entity") on behalf of each Enron trading entity 
participating in the E-commerce system, such process could expose the Enron 
trading entity to tax exposure in the jurisdiction in which the 
Administrative Entity is located - obviously, this may be more complicated if 
it is uncertain where such Administrative Entity is located).

Finally, it is understood that the manner in which trading is to be effected 
through the E-commerce system is such that the Enron trading entity 
established as the entity to trade with a particular counterparty will be the 
only such Enron entity transacting business with such counterparty.  In this 
regard, therefore, it is not contemplated that one Enron trading entity will 
transact in part with a counterparty and that another Enron trading entity 
will complete such trade (for example, it will not be possible for a 
counterparty to obtain an agreement with respect to a particular product with 
EEL that will then be supplied by ECT - though this may occur on occasion in 
a fashion no different that is currently the case).  Please notify me in the 
event that this understanding is not correct so that we can plan to mitigate 
the potential tax issues that will be raised if trading is to occur otherwise 
(in this regard, as was discussed on Tuesday with Dave Mally and David Port, 
if a trade is transacted in a manner whereby one Enron entity executes a 
transaction and fulfills the requirements of such by purchasing inventory 
from another Enron entity, the income derived in such transaction is 
potentially subject to taxation in multiple tax jurisdictions).

Please contact either myself at x30938 or, if I am unavailable, Jeff 
Blumenthal at x35777 in Houston with any follow-up questions.  Best regards.

Mark:

A suggestion.  I assume that whatever time I spend working for Global Assets, 
you will be charging back to the Global Assets group.   To keep things easy, 
I will be happy to let you know as often as you need the percentage of my 
time spent with the Global Assets group.   If you have other plans please let 
me know and I will be happy to do whatever is necessary to keep this simple 
and easy.

Hi Mark --

Attached is Oracle's standard NDA.  We can work with it if you like it or use 
our own.

The Oracle folks are dropping by Enron here in Houston on Friday of this week 
(the 5th).  If we are able to put an NDA in place by then, we will go into 
more detail with Oracle at the meeting.  If we do not have a new NDA in 
place, we will keep the meeting high level.  Thanks for your help.  Best 
regards.

-- Rex

Hi Dolores/Frank:

(1) Did you check on removing the TV from EB3866?  If there's a huge cost for 
relocating the TV, please let me know. Also, what is the cost for
 removing the TV?
 Charge CO/RC = 0413/105658

(2) We need to have the secretarial cube at EB3875 lowered to 42".  I guess 
this is a request for construction????
 Charge CO/RC = 0413/105659

(3) The copier has been delivered by my desk at EB3855A from 3AC.  Can we get 
a status on the engineers getting the plug ready?
 ( you know what I mean).

(4) We also need to get a drawing for reconstructing the area between my desk 
at EB3855A and EB3858/EB3858A/EB3858C/EB3858B.  We need to   maximize this 
space and add to secretarial workstations and maybe some type of closure to 
block the sound of the copier.

(5) We need to relocate the library currently at EB3858C to the team room at 
EB3872.

(6) Can I please get a current copy of the floor plan.

(7) The Cost Memo has been signed for the final phase of construction by Mark 
Haedicke.  Can I get the estimated date for construction to begin?
  I need to put in a churn request as soon as possible.

Today, Raul w/ McCoy came by and we did a walk through for the offices that 
were just completed.

Pertaining to the email below--I spoke to El Paso this morning about the 
gty's (there are a total of 3 in question covering financial and physical 
deals w/ENA, HPL, and EPMI).  They agreed to have those three amended to 
include the name El Paso Merchant Energy, LP (as they only include Gas, LP).  
This is what their Legal is recommending in order to have the gty amendments 
executed ASAP and to make it as clean as possible (since 2 of the 3 gty's are 
tied to contracts).  Also, the amendments will be made effective as of 
12/31/00.

Let me know if you think we should ask for completely new gty's.

We have received copies of a Certificate of Merger filed with the Delaware 
Secretary of State on 12/22/00, effective 12/31/00, wherein El Paso Merchant 
Energy-Gas, L.P. (Global Counterparty #72297), a Delaware limited 
partnership, merged with and into El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. (Global 
Counterparty #53350), a Delaware limited partnership, with El Paso Merchant 
Energy, L.P. (Global Counterparty #53350) as the surviving corporation.

By virtue of this merger, the ISDA Master Agreement dated 12/01/99 should now 
reflect El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. as the Counterparty.  In connection 
with this merger, Credit will be getting a new parent guaranty from the 
Counterparty.  Upon its receipt, copies will be distributed.

Copies of the Certificate of Merger will be distributed.






I think the answers will be the same for Stockholm - i.e. as long as we are 
not giving advice with respect to futures contracts (valuations or trading 
advice) or handling customer funds there should not be any Commodity Exchange

I can't believe you have to change planes in Chicago AND Dallas!  I don't

no way I can get away next week.  I have heard of las ventanas - but I didn't 
know about the evian spritzing.

Maybe next time.  Any more thoughts on a week that works for sailing?  I 
could spring for a bottle of evian and a plant mister......Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The next phase of 
the office construction process will begin in just over a week.  That means 
it is finally time to move into your new offices.  Taffy Milligan will be

will probably have a place for you to sit until your new office is ready.

Well Charlottesville actually has its own airport (looks a bit like St

bus or train).  I have an extra room reserved at Keswick Hall - very 
expensive - and at some point I have to release it or pay for it. Check it 
out at www.Keswick.com.    Rooms are tight over graduation weekend.

Subject: Draft Nordic Power Master Agreement

Please find attached a copy of the above document, marked to show changes 
from the draft of S&M, together with a clean copy thereof (please disregard 
any layout or file format deficiencies).  Besides further streamlining and 
refining of the doc, I've also styled it somewhat differently why it, on the 
face of the mark-ups, may appear even more amended than is the case. 
I've chosen to call the doc. 'Nordic Power Master Agreement' and inserted the 
Norwegian name of the Nordic Power Traders Association ("NPTA") in the header 
(hopefully, NPTA will be prepared to launch and market the doc. in its own 
name).  I've also prepared a brief Schedule addressing the optionality 
offered by the document.  The document is originally based upon ECT's 
Industrial Master Agreement.  In the Industrial Agreement, terms such as "the 
Contract", "this Contract", "this Agreement" and "the Agreement" are used 
interchangeably and not always with great preciseness.  In the attached 
document the terms "this Master Agreement" or "this Agreement" are used 
consistently (the latter to include all Transactions).  These are my remarks 
to the (principal) changes made, and to some issues that the new doc gives 
rise to:

1.  Transactions.  

I've introduced some ISDA wordings herein (for example, the "Inconsistency" 
provisions) and deleted text that I find less appropriate or necessary in the 
current context.

2.  Obligations

This is a critical Section since it also refers to products for which there 
currently are no NPTA documentation ("Options" and "Collars").  When I 
discussed this with the Nordic trading desk it sounded less thrilled about us 
expanding the current Nordic bilateral power contracts range, and I have 
therefore left references to options (other than swaptions and Asian options) 
within square brackets (including related definitions).  (Supposedly, this 
will be something for the Working Group, Reference Group and the NPTA to 
determine.)  I've expanded the text on SWAPs and included a brief reference 
to ASIAN (options) and also streamlined the Tax clause. 

3.  Representation

Reps are not particularly common in Nordic law contracts.  The "No Reliance" 
reps appear to be typically American and may not be to everyone's taste.  
Since parties seldom are prepared to give "Payee" reps I've cut out that part 
and also taken out the "Payer" reps as something that we should be able to do 
without.   I also feel a bit hesitant towards S&M's proposed "Changes in 
Representation" and therefore rubbed that one out as well (whilst being at 
it).

4.  Market Disruption

Since the underlying reference price (Nord Pool's spot price) is quoted on an 
hourly basis, some wordings have been included to reflect that.

5.  Events of Default

I'm mostly concerned about the cross-default clause.  Insofar as ECTRIC (and 
its possible Credit Support Provider) is concerned, we may, in this 
particular context, lose more than we gain from a cross default provision.  
Also, the cross default  also only appears to apply to "borrowed money" (and 
"such obligation") and not default under any other "specified transactions".  
It's worth considering making cross default optional and part of the Schedule 
instead.

6.  Remedies

As the enforceability of close-out netting in certain jurisdictions may 
require the automatic termination of all Transactions, it's  necessary to 
offer the parties the choice of "Automatic Early Termination" in the Schedule.

7.  Events of Change

I've followed the route of the Nordic 'Amendment Agreement' and pulled 
together "Events of  Change" and "Change in Tax Law" and done my best to 
streamline this sections since it undoubtedly will raise questions from local 
players in due course.

(The former sections 8 (Credit Support), 9 (Set-off) and 10 (Confidentiality) 
have been edited out.  The former because of the streamlining of the credit 
provisions (and related definitions) and the two latter since those concern 
issues that rather should be addressed by the parties bilaterally.)

8.  Governing Law and Jurisdiction

As previously discussed, this part is something for the parties to agree upon 
in the Schedule.

9.  Documents

As above under 8.

10.  Miscellaneous

I've crossed out the former "Currency Provisions" since it won't be 
enforceable in certain jurisdictions.  (Might be something for the Schedule.)

11.  Definitions

Some of the credit terms have been stricken out.  With reference to my 
earlier comment with respect to the uncertainty relating to the inclusion 
into the document of further options instruments, the related terms defined 
are in between square brackets.  Some of the defined terms may need to be 
further refined to better reflect the products, trading routines and 
settlement mechanisms in the Nordic Electricity market.

Exhibit A 

The relevant details can be found in the Schedule.

Please return with any comments you may have before close of business on 
Thursday (Oslo time).

Any chance this language came from a credit facility that provides for the

		 Subject: ISDA Collateral Question

Mark,

I copied a section of a counterparty's Bank Credit Agreement relating to 
certain 
negative pledges.  The counteparty is IMC Global whom we have some financial 
transactions with (actuall their sub IMC-Canada) at ECC, and now an EES 
person is looking to 
enter into a long term EES transaction.  We sent them a draft ISDA for future 
transactions 
out of ECC and we are now being told by the EES person that if a Credit 
Support Annex (CSA) 
is required in this ISDA it will kill her deal.  She has stated that they are 
not able 
to fulfil the obligations of the CSA because of the covenants tied to their 
Credit 
support agreement.  As highlighted in red below, it seems that they cannot 
have any liens that
secure derivative obligations, although cash is acceptable up to $10 
million.  Can you 
please clarify if collateral as it is stated in the ISDA is considered a 
lien, and if this type 
collateral would be a breach of their credit agreement.  If this is a breach 
can you suggest 
other methods that we might use so the CSA would be acceptable.

Thanks
Russell





Negative Pledge.   Neither  any Borrower nor  any  Subsidiary  of  any
Borrower  will create, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any  asset
now owned or hereafter acquired by it, except:

Liens  existing on the date of this Agreement securing Debt outstanding
on  the date of this Agreement in an aggregate principal or face amount
not exceeding $135,000,000;

any  Lien  existing on any asset of any Person at the time such  Person
becomes a Subsidiary of a Borrower and not created in contemplation  of
such event;

any Lien on any asset securing Debt incurred or assumed for the purpose
of  financing  all or any part of the cost of acquiring or constructing
such asset, provided that such Lien attaches to such asset concurrently
with  or  within  90  days  after  the  acquisition  or  completion  of
construction thereof;

any Lien on any asset of any Person existing at the time such Person is
merged  or  consolidated with or into a Borrower or a Subsidiary  of  a
Borrower and not created in contemplation of such event;

any  Lien existing on any asset prior to the acquisition thereof  by  a
Borrower or a Subsidiary of a Borrower and not created in contemplation
of such acquisition;

any  Lien  arising  out  of  the  refinancing,  extension,  renewal  or
refunding  of  any Debt secured by any Lien permitted  by  any  of  the
foregoing clauses of this Section, provided that the proceeds  of  such
Debt  are  used  solely for the foregoing purpose and to pay  financing
costs and such Debt is not secured by any additional assets;

Liens  arising in the ordinary course of its business which (i) do  not
secure  Debt  or  Derivatives  Obligations,  (ii)  do  not  secure  any
obligation in an amount exceeding $100,000,000 and (iii) do not in  the
aggregate materially detract from the value of its assets or materially
impair the use thereof in the operation of its business;

Liens  on  cash and cash equivalents securing Derivatives  Obligations,
provided that the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents subject
to such Liens may at no time exceed $10,000,000; and

Liens  not otherwise permitted by the foregoing clauses of this Section
securing  Debt in an aggregate principal or face amount, together  with
all  other Debt secured by Liens permitted under this Section  5.09(i),
not  to  exceed  an  amount  equal to 10%  of  Consolidated  Net  Worth
(calculated  as  of  the last day of the fiscal quarter  most  recently
ended  on  or prior to the date of the most recent incurrence  of  such
Debt).
Seems to me that L/C's are the way to go then, rather than asking for cash or 
another asset as collateral.  (Another option would be to mix and match - 
taking cash up to $10 mil. and L/C's beyond that.)   Lenders frequently set 
up the facilities available to the borrower this way so they keep control 
over how much "debt" is supported by the asset base while still giving the 
borrower some flexibility.  As you can imagine, most other extenders of 
credit are willing to take the bank's L/C in lieu of a lien on a hard asset.

Nora - I got your voice mail & will try to call you soon - I'm stuck on a 
conference call.  I tend to agree with you - this seems to me to be contrary

want to make if we were on the other side.

Mark, what are your thoughts on attached from EOL perspective?  Envera's 
proposal is inconsistent with Enron legal policy on punitive, consequential, 
lost profit type damages.  Please let me know your thoughts.  Thanks, NJD

Subject: Linking Agreements - Indemnity Issue


Envera still has an issue with the indemnity offered under the Linking
Agreements.  As we discussed in our conference yesterday, Envera cannot
permit DealBench or EnronOnline to disclaim consequential damages that may
be payable to a plaintiff in a trademark infringement action.  Envera is not
seeking to recover Envera's own lost profits or consequential damages, just
those that Envera must pay to a plaintiff in an infringement action.

Envera's request is that a statement be added to the indemnity section
clarifying that any damages awarded in a final judgment or paid in
settlement of an infringement claim be deemed "direct" damages.  Dean stated
in yesterday's e-mail that DealBench, as a matter of policy, does not agree
to such requests.

After some discussion among Envera business people, Envera is uncomfortable
with the position taken by DealBench and Enron on this issue.  If DealBench
and Enron are not prepared to stand behind the trademarks that they so
vigorously protect in the Linking Agreements, then Envera is not prepared to
shoulder the risk that Envera would be required come out of pocket for a
plaintiff's lost profits.  Envera is not able to control the risk that
EnronOnline and DealBench have chosen infringing trademarks, other than by
not establishing the links at all.

If the concern of DealBench and EnronOnline is that they could be required
to pay punitive damages that arise from Envera's misuse of the trademarks,
this eventuality is already covered in the indemnity provision.  Neither
party is required to indemnify Envera for infringement claims based upon any
use of the marks not expressly authorized under the Linking Agreements.

I have attached drafts of the two Linking Agreements, marked to show the
language that Envera would like added to Section 4(c).  Please review the
proposed changes and let me know whether they are acceptable to DealBench
and EnronOnline.  If not, Envera will need to consider whether it will even
establish the links.

Regards,

Jonathan

dinner - your choice - including Ted on Saturday.  We have no plans at all so 
far so we're flexible.

MarkTana has pointed out that Net Works does not have a policy (at least not one 
we have heard of) regarding the handling of original contract documentation 
after it is executed.  There is not an Enron-wide policy but instead a 
patch-work of policies created by the operating units.  Tana and I would be 
happy to discuss this with you - or whoever you want to designate - and make 
suggestions if you don't already have a plan in mind.----- Forwarded by Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT on 01/18/2001 05:42 PM -----

What we need to accomplish in the next few days:

Dave Forster and Mark Palmer will develop and finalize the demo that will be 
used for pitching the sale.  Dave and Mark will create two demos, one which 
shows how Enron uses the tools/system(s) and two, a demo on how a company 
such as Carghill would use the tools in a private application.  This will all 
then be set up so it can be shown on the road or in house to clients.  Dave 
and Mark have started this work today.

Mark Taylor will work the following two legal issues in parallel:  First, 
find outside council that will be able to help with the internal audit of all 
legal contracts associated with EOL as well as be able to assist in legal 
matters associated with the due diligence and assist in contract work 
associated with the actual sale in the future.  The legal audit must be 
prepared and completed by early next week so we can keep our planned visit 
with i2 late next week and feel comfortable that we can sell we are proposing 
to sell from a legal standpoint.

Jay will complete the technical audit and write up his conclusions (or Kevin).

Rex and Greg will continue to refine the list of potential clients and the 
appropriate contacts on the list.  Any suggestions on how to make sure we 
have the right names, etc. just send them in to Rex.

Rex will also refine the actual presentation to be used in the pitch and get 
a copy to Louise in the next day or two so she can review the content of it.

We will also need t o have a separate timeline/calendar that shows who we are 
seeing when, etc.

Any other thoughts or issues from the team?

GPThere will need to be confirmation templates for the internet-generated 
transactions that are slightly different from templates now used for 
telephone-generated transactions - Legal will have to give the confirm desk 
the necessary language.  This is not the GTC issue you and I discussed the 
other day - rather, I think the question is How will the internet-generated 
trade information reach the confirm desk and how will they know to use the 
internet trading language in the confirm they generate?

Welcome to Enron!  I usually get to the London office a couple of times a

Most of your e-mail is well outside my area of expertise.  Are you consulting

you told me what 10.2 says.....

Feel free to give me a call if you'd like to discuss.

Subject: Re: Late Delivery  

Robbi, I assumed that to be the way it would work, which seems to require 
that total non-performance is viewed as an SLA failure, presumably then in 
the form of Unavailability - if no seconds are delivered at all, then 
Unavailable Seconds certainly exceed any normal threshold - resulting in 
Credits.  But I was not able to access the actual definition of Unavailable 
Seconds thru the www.ansi.org website, but someone here should have them.  
There would then also be a cut-off date, beyond which Buyer would not have to 
be satisfied with only receiving Credits, when the Unavailable Seconds exceed 
the threshold determined for Product Termination Event thus enabling Buyer to 
terminate.  

But would not this construction become a bit strained if the ANSI standard 
refers to seconds that are unavailable in an otherwise up and running 
connection (as the reference to path performance monitoring may suggest)?  

When you prepared the document, did you consider explicitly dealing with 
total non-performance (for example, by explicitly stating, for the sake of 
clarification, that Unavailable Seconds shall also include the case where no 
seconds are delivered at all)?  

I understand that 10.2 (ii) is based on US regulatory requirements.  Are 
there any other sections that are solely based on such requirements?

Peter,

  In response to your voice message, if our supplier fails to deliver on 
time, we are entitled to collect liquidated damages from such supplier.  If 
we have resold the circuit and are unable to deliver to our customer because 
of the failure of our supplier, we in turn will have to pay our customer 
liquidated damages for late delivery.  This is why it is so important to 
"back to back" the trades to the extent possible.  Please let me know if you 
have any other questions.  Hang in there!

Hey Jim,

Thanks for the note.  Nothing much new to report here.  Ted was in South 
Beach last weekend but came home a day early to work.  He's still trying to 
talk me into buying a new car which I would like to do but can't figure out 
what I really want.  I'm speaking at a conference in Key West next week and 
will stay through the weekend - I think it's the only place left on the 
continent that's warm.  Nothing like Zurich here but it's been in the 40's 
and rainy - seems like forever since I've been fully warm through.

There will need to be confirmation templates for the internet-generated 
transactions that are slightly different from templates now used for 
telephone-generated transactions - Legal will have to give the confirm desk 
the necessary language.  This is not the GTC issue you and I discussed the 
other day - rather, I think the question is How will the internet-generated 
trade information reach the confirm desk and how will they know to use the 
internet trading language in the confirm they generate?

Very good question - while you don't need to worry about otc swaps, otc 
options might be a problem.  However, if the customer is not a US entity, the 
advice is all given outside the US and does not relate to US futures or 
options, we feel reasonably comfortable that the risk is quite low that there 
would be a problem.

Thanks for the response.  Does the term "futures contract" also include 
bilateral swaps (or it restricted to exchange-traded futures) and will it 
make any difference if the couterparty/customer is a non-US entity?!

Grassley Continues Effort to Overhaul Bankruptcy System
WASHINGTON - Sen. Chuck Grassley introduced legislation last night to
overhaul the nation's bankruptcy system.

The bill he introduced - S.220 - is identical to the final conference report
approved last year by the Senate and House of Representatives but
pocket-vetoed by President Clinton.

Grassley said that he looks forward to Senate action on the measure which
had veto-proof support last year. Senators voted 70-28 for the final
package, and the House gave the conference report unanimous approval in
December. Rep. George Gekas is expected to reintroduce the legislation in
the House.

The Senate Majority Leader has indicated that the bankruptcy reform bill
could be ready for consideration by the Senate as early as next week.
Grassley said the proposal which he sponsored last year with Sen. Robert
Torricelli of New Jersey "is unfinished business that has strong bipartisan
support in Congress and at the grassroots."

The reform measure is aimed at reducing the number of bankruptcies filed
each year by fixing weaknesses in the code and designing a more balanced,
fair approach for debtors and creditors. The number of bankruptcies have
soared during the last decade despite a historically strong economy. And,
according to a study released late last year, experts are predicting a 15
percent increase in bankruptcies in 2001.

The legislation advanced by Grassley and Gekas also includes permanent
status and an expansion of Chapter 12, which is tailored to help farmers
reorganize debt and stay in the business of farming. It also includes a
patients' bill of rights for residents of nursing homes and hospitals that
declare bankruptcy. Another key provision helps to strengthen the Medicare
Trust Fund by prohibiting the discharge of debts arising from inflated bills
and fraudulent claims.

The legislation reintroduced today reflects the bipartisan, bicameral
agreement reached late last year on the most comprehensive reform of
bankruptcy law since 1978.

Grassley said "reforming the system will be good for consumers and families.
It would bring more fairness for those who work hard to pay their bills.
Every bankruptcy filed puts upward pressure on interest rates, so decreasing
the number is good for people trying to buy a new house or pay for a car.
Reforming the bankruptcy system will help usher in a new era of greater
personal responsibility." The Iowa senator began his effort to reform the
bankruptcy system in 1997, when he held a hearing on the relationship
between credit card debt and consumer bankruptcy.

The bill that resulted addresses the problems caused by irresponsible
consumerism, an aggressive credit industry, lax bankruptcy laws and
lawyer-run bankruptcy mills. It sets up a flexible formula for bankruptcy
judges to channel those with repayment capacity to Chapter 13. Currently,
the overwhelming majority of debtors file under Chapter 7, which effectively
wipes away their debts. Only about one-third of debtors opt to file under
Chapter 13, which requires some repayment plan to reimburse creditors.

The measure also seeks to improve the bankruptcy system for consumers by
promoting credit counseling services and educational courses for debtors
prior to filing a bankruptcy petition. The plan strengthens enforcement and
penalties against coercive tactics by creditors. It penalizes creditors who
seek a double-payment and establishes tough penalties for creditors who use
threats to coerce debtors into voluntarily agreeing to pay a debt which
could be wiped away in bankruptcy.

The legislation will minimize court dockets and keep costs down. It promotes
the alternative dispute resolution process by saying that if someone in
financial trouble tries in good faith to work out a reasonable repayment
plan, but a creditor rejects this, then the ability of the creditor to
collect in bankruptcy will be sharply curtailed.

The bill also would make Chapter 12 for farmers a permanent part of the
bankruptcy code. The package strengthens this tool for farmers by making an
increased number of farmers eligible for Chapter 12 protections and making
the federal government last on the list of creditors when a farmer sells
farm assets during reorganization. Changing the treatment of capital gains
taxes under Chapter 12 would give farmers greater flexibility in
reorganizing their financial affairs.

Finally, the reform proposal includes:

- a provision to protect quality of care for patients - especially nursing
home residents - when a health care provider is in bankruptcy. Current law
does not guarantee the well-being of patients in a bankruptcy case. Two
years ago, residents of a California nursing home were literally evicted
onto the street by a bankruptcy trustee.

- a provision setting new requirements for credit card companies and protect
consumers. These provisions reflect some of the most significant
pro-consumer legislation considered by the Senate in a decade. Under the
measure, creditors are required to display prominently a minimum payment
warning on every credit card statement. This feature would include a
toll-free number for credit card holders to learn how many months it would
take to repay a certain balance with minimum monthly payments. It also
requires credit card solicitations to disclose when a low introductory rate
ends and what the subsequent rate will be. And, it requires credit card
solicitations via the Internet to comply with the Truth in Lending Act.

- unprecedented new protections for child support claimants. The reform bill
allows claimants to access otherwise off-limits property and has the support
of key child support advocates.

- limits on the ability of individuals to protect assets by purchasing an
expensive home. Right now, there are no limits on the value of a homestead
that is off-limits to creditors. Although the General Accounting Office
found only scant evidence of systemic abuse of the homestead exemption, the
bankruptcy reform bill includes changes long-advocated by Sen. Herb Kohl of
Wisconsin and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama to put a $100,000 cap on home
equity acquired within two years prior to declaring bankruptcy. The
Kohl-Sessions proposal requires that an individual establish residency for
two years prior to bankruptcy in order to claim the homestead exemption of a
particular state. The bill also allows creditors to seize any home equity
acquired with the intent to delay or hinder collection efforts within seven
years prior to declaring bankruptcy. And it says the home equity built up
applies to the $100,000 cap even if an individual relocates from one state
to another.

Since 1990, the rate of personal bankruptcy filings has increased almost 100
percent. Since 1980, the number of Americans declaring bankruptcy has
exploded from 331,264 to just under 1.4 million last year. Filings began to
increase dramatically after 1985, despite the strong economy.

Kids' Stuff| Biography / In ActionI'm very flexible on who comes along - no views at all on that score.  It 
would help to know the number and cabin sharing arrangement ahead of time so 
we can book the correct size boat.  You can always change the amount of 
groceries but at some point all the boats will be reserved.

I called Keswick last week and gave them my credit card number for the extra 
room - it looks great from the website.  Will you be golfing or should we 
make massage appointments?  Now that I think about it, I'm not sure which 
days we have reserved - another alternative might be to stay near DC on the 
day we get back from sailing (Inn at Little Washington?).  My guess is it's 
an all day affair getting from a little island to DC so we may get in pretty 
late.

their Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas. =20

I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desig=
n=20
session.  This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13t=
h=20
in Dallas, Texas.   This work session is based on a unique approach called =
a=20
DesignShop=01v.  It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is compos=
ed of=20
various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups. If you=
=20
have not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely=20
regard this session as different from any working session you have previous=
ly=20
experienced. The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven=
=20
to be very successful.  Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same=20
methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.

A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.  You were=
=20
selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th=
e=20
DesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as=
=20
little distraction or interruption as possible.  The quality of our results=
=20
depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the=
=20
entire event.   Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor=
t=20
and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session. =
=20
This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s=
o=20
that your participation can be maximized. Therefore, please make all=20
necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during=
=20
these two days.

Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,=
=20
and transportation.  Preliminary information as to schedule and environment=
=20
has also been included.  You may direct any additional questions concerning=
=20
the event to Mary Solmonson at (713)-853-6079.

I hope that you will be able to participate.  Please confirm your attendanc=
e=20
for the two days with Marvia Jefferson at 713-853-9165 by January 29th 5:00=
=20
p.m.  If you are unable to attend, it may be appropriate to select someone=
=20
else to participate.  Please do not extend an invitation to anyone else to=
=20
take your place until you and I have discussed this.

I thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing yo=
u=20
in Dallas!

Very funny - although I have to say I thought yours was the least humorous of 
the bunch.----- Forwarded by Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT on 02/01/2001 06:34 PM -----

		 Subject: Additional Information - Dallas ASE February 12-13th

By now, you should all have your travel plans finalized.  Please help us in 
planning by providing your itinerary including flights and arrival/departure 
times to Marvia Jefferson if you haven't already done so.  We need this by 
tomorrow morning if possible, so we can finalize all plans for meals and 
transportation.   Please review the attached document for additional details 
on the ASE event including hotel, transportation, and schedule.  Changes from 
the previous communication have been highlighted in blue.



In addition, here are driving directions to and from various places should 
you require them.



Should you have any further questions, please feel free to call either myself 
at x3-6079 or Marvia at x3-9165.

See you in Dallas!As you are all aware, the legal department has grown significantly over the 
last several months.  While so far we have been able to find places for 
everyone to sit, we have not added significantly to the available file 
cabinet space on the floor.  In fact, a number of file cabinets are now in 
locations where they will not be able to remain due to fire code requirements.

Please review the files you currently have stored outside your own office 
space and, after condensing, archiving and destroying as many as possible, 
give an inventory of your current usage and needs to your group leader.  Once 
we have an accurate picture of our needs, we can come up with a plan to 
allocate the available file cabinet space.  Most if not all of us will have 
to make significant sacrifices and modify our filing practices so that we 
each reduce our file space usage to our fair share.   ----- Forwarded by Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT on 02/06/2001 02:27 PM -----

We have arranged for representatives from tax, accounting, commercial, and 
legal to make presentations relating to the purpose, structure, mechanics, 
etc. associated with the Whitewing/Condor deconsolidated affiliate.  I think 
that the more all of us are "conversant" with that structure, it should 
simplify the legal efforts in closing deals---especially in Q4.  To that end, 
please invite those colleagues of yours that could benefit from this 
presentation and please let my assistant, Darlene Forsyth at x37254 , know 
who will be attending so we can reserve the right size conference room and 
order lunch.

Thanks.

cabinet space on the floor.  In fact, a number of file cabinets are now in 
locations where they will not be able to remain due to fire code requirements.

Please review the files you currently have stored outside your own office 
space and, after condensing, archiving and destroying as many as possible, 
give an inventory of your current usage and needs to your group leader.  Once 
we have an accurate picture of our needs, we can come up with a plan to 
allocate the available file cabinet space.  Most if not all of us will have 
to make significant sacrifices and modify our filing practices so that we 
each reduce our file space usage to our fair share.   Sheri -

		 Subject: Conectiv/Delmarva

I wanted to provide you with an update on this dispute.

As you will recall, we originally thought that we were the buyer on a Nov '00 
- March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6 and Conectiv/Delmarva was the seller.  At 
least that is what our deal ticket indicated.  Conectiv/Delmarva disagreed 
vehemently, contending that they were the buyer and we were the seller.

Last week I obtained the tapes from the broker, Natsource.  I previously 
forwarded the tapes to you.  The tapes unequivocally indicate that we were 
the seller.  In fact, the tapes reflect that we sold two Nov '00 - March '01 
basis swap @ Transco Z6 contracts at the same time -- one to 
Conectiv/Delmarva and one to Duke.  We have gone back and checked our records 
to see if we actually sold a Nov '00 - March '01 basis swap @ Transco Z6 
contract to Duke at the same time we entered into a deal with 
Conectiv/Delmarva.  We did.  Notwithstanding the clear language on the tape, 
it would be hard to explain with a straight face why we would sell a swap to 
Duke and buy a swap from Conectiv/Delmarva at the same time.

After the trade, Natsource sent us a confirmation, indicating that we were 
the seller and Conectiv/Delmarva was the buyer.  Although we sent 
Conectiv/Delmarva a confirm (and they signed it) reflecting that we were the 
buyer and they were the seller, we settled the swap for the first two months 
as if we were the seller and they were the buyer.

The long and short of it is that, from a legal standpoint, there is no 
question whatsoever that the intention of the parties was that Enron would be 
the seller and Conectiv/Delmarva would be the buyer.  This is not even a 
close call.  It is my advice that we should settle the trade as if we are the 
seller and Conectiv/Delmarva is the buyer, and move on.

		 Subject: More Dallas ASE Information

The start time for Tuesday morning has been changed from 9am to 8am.  
Breakfast will be served at 7:30.  Therefore, shuttle pick up times at the 
hotel for Tuesday morning have been changed to 7:10, 7:25, and 7:40 am.  
Again, the last shuttle is not recommended if you intend to have breakfast at 
the ASE.

Some of you had asked about a coordinated dinner for Sunday night.  Since 
arrival times into Dallas vary greatly, we are leaving you to your own 
devices for Sunday night.  We are however, planning a group dinner for Monday 
night after we wrap up for the day.  We will arrange transportation from the 
ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel.  Currently, 
Monday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm.  Therefore, we are 
planning to head to dinner directly from the ASE without a break or trip back 
to the hotel. 

I spoke with Susan Bulgawicz again today.  She relates the following points:

Gensler has been subcontracted to do interior space planning and design for 
the new building generally
While our work is probably in addition to that already agreed (and will 
therefore be billed to us) it should be covered by an amendment to the 
existing agreement rather than a new, separate agreement
Bill Donovan feels that the design and space planning work should be done as 
near in time as possible to the actual construction work to avoid having to 
redo the work (and pay twice) to take into account new factors not apparent 
earlier (e.g. organizational and technology changes)
Bill's view is that we are 3 to 6 months premature at this point in doing 
this work for the legal department

Susan suggested that you might want to call Bill to discuss this and talk 
about how you want to move forward.----- Forwarded by Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT on 02/08/2001 02:35 PM -----

USA:
INTERVIEW-Online exchange TradeSpark says building critical mass.
By Andrew Kelly

02/08/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - TradeSpark, an online energy exchange launched late
last year, said on Thursday it was making good progress toward its goal of
establishing itself as a liquid marketplace for trading energy products.

"We expect certainly by the end of this year to have critical mass in certain
instruments, in certain products, and to be the (trading) platform of record,"
Managing Director Mike Williams told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Earlier on Thursday, TradeSpark (www.tradespark.com) said it had clocked up
energy trades with a notional value of more than $16 billion since it opened
for trading on Oct 2, 2000.

Natural gas accounted for over $9 billion of the trades logged so far and
electricity for about $6 billion.

TradeSpark also said that more than 125 companies and roughly 550 traders are
currently registered to use the system to execute their energy transactions.

It was the first time that the limited partnership had released data on
trading volumes and user numbers.

Most electronic energy trading platforms have been reluctant to release such
information and analysts have predicted that only a handful who succeed in
generating large volumes of business relatively quickly, will survive the
inevitable shakeout ahead.

SYSTEM USERS INCLUDE ENRON

Williams said TradeSpark had already signed up "all the big names" in North
America's wholesale natural gas and electricity business, including its
800-pound gorilla, Enron Corp..

"They are a user of the system. They've been a customer of ours since we
started," he said of Enron, though he declined to provide further details
about Enron's use of TradeSpark.

Enron launched its own electronic trading platform, EnronOnline
(www.enrononline.com), in late 1999 and used it to execute deals worth $336
billion last year. EnronOnline is a bilateral trading system on which Enron
posts buy and sell prices and is either the buyer or seller in any deals that
take place.

Williams said bilateral and multilateral platforms were completely different
and that both could coexist in harmony.

Enron, for its part, has said it is willing to use any kind of trading
platform that helps its traders to do business.

TradeSpark's founding partners include electronic commerce firm eSpeed Inc.,
brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald, energy firms Williams Cos. and TXU Corp. and
Royal Dutch/Shell affiliate Coral Energy.

Dynegy Inc., which also has its own bilateral trading platform, Dynegydirect
(dynegydirect.com), has used TradeSpark from its launch and has also announced
plans to become a partner in the venture at a later date.

Despite some of the big energy names associated with TradeSpark, Williams
emphasized its neutrality, including anonymity of the prices posted on the
system.

In January, traders who were not associated with one of TradeSpark's founding
partners accounted for 58 percent of all trades, up from 48 percent in
December.

Williams said TradeSpark would expand its product offerings next month to add
physical natural gas products alongside the financial gas instruments
currently available.

Financial electricity instruments will also be added some time this year, he
said, to complement the physical electricity products on offer now.

I just returned from the Bond Market Association meeting this afternoon on
the pending bankruptcy legislation.  Chris Long (Enron) was there with
Ellen Levinson of our Washington office.
The "big" issue discussed was whether to push hard for amendments on
cross-affiliate netting.  The consensus was that while everyone in the room
(and all of Wall Street was there,as well as ISDA and commodities groups)
wants the amendments, they are considered controversial by the President's
Working Group and could derail progress on the version of bankruptcy reform
currently before Congress which everyone also agrees is very good
legislation for financial markets participants.  On the basis that getting
the current bill enacted quickly is of paramount importance, the
Association determined to "back pocket" the cross-affiliate netting issue,
meaning that if the current legislation moves quickly, the Association will
not raise the issue but if the legislation gets bogged down in committee
and other nontechnical changes are being proposed, the Association will use
that opportunity to add cross-affiliate netting provisions.

Feel free to call if you have any questions.

Attached is the email forwarding the draft swap agt with SG.

Rogelio--please take a look at the docs required in Part 3-- some changes 
will need to be made I am sure to reflect that EEIM is a Mexican 
company--please fax me a markup with your suggested changes.  It looks like 
we are going to need Mexican Power of Attorney for CT Corp. for this 
agreement also.

Carlyn--please look at the CT Corp. appointment letter and let me know if any 
hedging agt is contemplated to be included.  We may need a separate 
appointment letter for this document (see Part 5, clause (vi)) -- note also 
that the jurisdictional consent language is different than in the Loan Agt 
and most of the other IDB docs--I don't think we care but I will point it out 
to SG--they may want to conform the language to have the same court 
jurisdiction.

Mike--on substantive issues, please call me when you get back into town and 
have a moment to talk.  I spoke with one of my partners in Houston who is 
much more familiar with swaps and he thinks it looks ok for the most part--I 
have only a few questions/comments for you.

Thanks all!

Treatment for Hedging Transactions


Re: Proposed Regulations Providing for Ordinary Character Treatment
for Certain Hedging Transactions

                     Attached is a memorandum, dated February 12, 2001,
from Sullivan & Cromwell concerning the above subject. A summary is
also included at the end of the text of this e-mail message.

                     The attached file is in Adobe Acrobat
format.  We believe most PCs will already have an Acrobat viewer
loaded; we can provide free copies if Acrobat is not already loaded,
and free copies can also be downloaded from the Adobe Acrobat web

SUMMARY

                    On January 18, 2001, the Internal Revenue
Service (the "IRS") issued proposed regulations (the
"Proposed Regulations") under Section 1221 of the Internal
Revenue Code (the "Code") providing for the income and
loss from most business hedging transactions to be treated
as ordinary.

                   The Proposed Regulations reflect changes
made to Section 1221 by the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives
Improvement Act of 1999.  The Proposed Regulations are
practically identical to existing regulations under Section
1221 (the "Existing Regulations") with two modifications
reflecting the changes in the law -- (1) they adopt a risk
"management" standard for defining a hedging transaction
(as opposed to the risk "reduction" standard used in the
Existing Regulations) and (2) they remove the special
rule imposing certain additional conditions on hedges of
non-inventory supplies.  The Existing Regulations have not
been withdrawn, but the Proposed Regulations are proposed
to be effective for transactions entered into on or after
January 18, 2001.

Mark,

I have attached our draft version of the Enron License and Services Agreement.

As we discussed on our call, there are a number of issues which require 
clarification and which we have highlighted in the Agreement. There are a 
number of areas, in particular Service Support, were we have proposed 
possible approaches but we obviously do not know whether these suggestions 
will work for Enron or are consistent with the intention to run the service ( 
e.g., Service Levels in Schedule B.)

If you have any comments or questions please email or call either myself at 
(212) 558-3491, David at (212) 558-4680 or Anna at (202) 956-7575.

Mark,
Please find attached our first revision of the EnronOnline Service Agreement 
Draft. As you may notice on your calendar, we asked Holly to schedule a 
conference call with Sullivan & Crom well for today @11:00 to go over our 
comments and their questions. Please, if you consider convenient, forward 
them this document so they have it before the conference call and we can go 
directly to our comments.
Some of the additional issues we want to talk to them/ you are:
We are not licensing the Stack Manager, we are just giving them access to it, 
therefore there is no "Software License"
Prohibit Pipeline's usage of EnonOnline name without our written approval
Default & Remedies
Definitions to be added
Invoicing & Terms of payment
Marketing Brochures & materials
Define Schedule B & C (Support Services & Termination payments), and
Timeline

We really appreciate your help in pushing this, as you know we need to have 
this document finalised by no latter than Tuesday morning, since Dave is 
meeting with NGPL on Wednesday,
Thanks
Carlos

		 Subject: Mexico City Conference - FEBRUARY 16, 2001


 Here's the article I mentioned.  (Also in today's Press Report -
with same copyright caveat!).

 This is particularly interesting in light of our conversation on the
May 7-8 Mexico City ISDA Conference we are planning.  The agenda is "in
formation".  Jose Manuel (Board liaison) and Diane Genova (Chair) of the
Latin American Committee are enthusiastically involved and Pedro is our
staff liaison.  We have great support from the Bank of Mexico, NAFINSA,
Mexder (the exchange) and the Mexican Banking Association (all of which will
contribute speakers).  We would very much welcome one or more Enron speakers
- particularly from the region.  (We contemplate simultaneous
Spanish/English and English/Spanish translation to accommodate and encourage
both English and Spanish speakers).  Bob, Diane, Jose Manuel will also be
speakers.

 Here's a preview of the still very preliminary (and uncirculated)
Agenda:

 DAY 1:

 _morning
 Intro
 Keynote
 History and Development of OTC Derivatives
 Legal and Regulatory Standards in the Global Derivatives Markets
 Risk Mangement in the Derivatives Markets
 Overview of ISDA and current Activities

 _afternoon
 3 Workshops*
 I.  Comparative analysis:  Local Master Agreements and the ISDA
Master Agreement
 II.  Current Approaches to Risk Management
 III.  Financial Innovation: Growth and New Products*

 DAY 2'

 Keynote:  Economic Outlook
 Panel:  OTC Derivatives in Emerging Markets _ Latin American Focus*
 Credit and Equity Derivatives
 Review of New Bankruptcy Law and Regulatory Developments
 OTC Derivatives and Repo Transactions in Mexico
 Accounting and Tax Treatment of Derivatives and Repos in Mexico
 Synergy between Exchanges and OTC Derivatives in Mexico*


 I've put asterisks in several places where Enron would be a terrific
addition.  Other areas may also be appropriate.  Please let Diane, Pedro or
me know your thoughts.  Thak you.

 Best regards, Ruth

>
> Unpredictable weather and deregulation of Latin America's electricity
> industry have serious implications for power companies in the region. They
> must simultaneously manage the risks associated with nature as well as
> those inherent in a free market.
>
> In Argentina, Brazil and Chile, where power comes mainly from
> hydroelectric dams, the industry is vulnerable to fluctuations in
> rainfall. Meanwhile, privatization and deregulation of the electricity
> market in these countries will require generators and distributors to
> manage shortfalls and excesses in power more efficiently, a function
> financial markets are already fulfilling in the US and Europe. The use of
> financial hedges to mitigate risk is a trend companies and regulators in
> Latin America want to encourage.
>
> Mitigating weather risk is not an abstract problem for the Latin markets.
> In 1998, power generation in Chile nearly ground to a halt when droughts
> caused power cuts at hydroelectric generators. One of the most affected,
> Chile's Pullinque 49 megawatt hydroelectric dam, was forced to halt
> production when river water levels dropped drastically Scudder Kemper
> Investments and Energia Global International, who were investors in the
> project, rescued
> the plant in a $52 million deal.
>
> John Northrop, of Scudder's Latin American power group, says the company
> did not consider hedging against weather risk prior to the drought in
> 1998, since financial cover was written into the generator's 30-year power
> purchase agreement with Endesa, Chile's main power company and largest
> hydroelectric investor. Under a unique agreement between Endesa and the
> generator, Endesa had to buy power from Pullinque, but the plant was not
> required to supply power to Endesa. Unlike other hydroelectric plants in
> the region, Pullinque wasn't forced to purchase expensive natural gas
> power in the spot market to keep the plant running at a loss.
>
> During the drought, Endesa was unable to buy adequate hydroelectric output
> and had to rely on older, inefficient fossil fuel power plants to
> supplement hydroelectric production. Since then, Chile has begun importing
> natural gas power through the $325 million GasAndes pipeline from Mendoza
> in Argentina.
>
> Power companies in Brazil currently rely on assured power arrangements in
> which generators cover one another for shortfalls in energy. ma
> deregulated market, they will be able to buy and sell power as needed.
>
> The rising number of natural gas-fired merchant power projects, which sell
> all their power to the spot market when demand is high, shows how
> profitable this business can be. According to Capital DATA's global
> project finance database, financing for $4.5 billion worth of merchant
> power projects in Latin America is complete to date, with $10.2 billion in
> the pipeline. Argentina already has five operating merchant power plants
> supplying power to the spot market. Brazil is preparing itself for
> deregulation in 2003 with the launch of a thermoelectric power generation
> program that will build 49 new plants by 2003.
>
> US energy companies such as AES, Enron and Duke Energy are lining up to
> snap up distribution and generation companies in government
> privatizations. In Brazil alone, auctions of Cesp, the S?o Paulo
> generator, and Eletrobras, the federally owned generator, are expected
> this year.
>
> Following the lead of US energy companies, providers of risk management
> products are looking to get involved. One innovative risk management
> financing structure-for a power plant in Cartegena, Colombia-has been
> completed in the region and insurers, re-insurers and even investment
> banks are incorporating risk management into debt products in case another
> drought stifles hydroelectric power and injects price volatility into the
> spot market.
>
> Setting a Standard
> The Termocandelaria 314 megawatt 'peaking' gas-fired merchant power plant
> in Cartegena sells thermal power to Colombia's spot market. Colombia
> derives 70% of its power from hydroelectricity as a merchant power plant
> selling all its power to the spot market, Termocandelaria is 100% exposed
> to revenue risks.
>
> The sponsor, KMR Power Corp., originally planned to raise financing in
> 1998 with a high-yield debt issue in New York's 144A bond markets. When
> the bond market shut its doors to emerging market borrowers following the
> Russian crisis, the company was forced to look for an alternative
> financing scheme. KMR Power secured an agreement with Centre Solutions, a
> risk management unit of Zurich Financial Services, to guarantee an $85
> million subordinated loan structured to absorb power price volatility
> risks.
>
> Stefan Marti, vice president at the Centre Group in New York, says the
> insurance company determined KMR's debt repayments based on a seven-year
> projected rainfall profile. Termocandelaria scheduled repayments for
> periods when there was little rainfall and therefore increased demand for
> natural gas power in the spot market. Double A- rated Centre Solutions
> guaranteed to meet payments if revenues dipped. Marti says there were
> periods when Centre would make payments and recover them later.
>
> Once KMR Power secured this insurance, Bank of America agreed to syndicate
> a $90 million, five-year senior loan. Centre also took a $35 million chunk
> of the senior debt and five local banks joined the syndicate.
>
> Centre's participation was a landmark because until 1998, insurance was
> designed to cover catastrophic events and not to manage fluctuations in
> weather patterns. That year, MG Risk Finance, a division of the insurance
> company American International Group, developed its snow, temperature and
> rain management product to protect revenues that were adversely affected
> by unfavorable weather. MG provided insurance for an excess or shortfall
> in precipitation, extreme temperatures or any other weather event as
> measured by an independent weather source.
>
> Since the inception in the US of the weather risk management industry in
> 1997, and the creation of tradable financial instruments, approximately
> 5,000 weather derivative trades worth more than
> $5 billion have been completed.
>
> Enron was the first energy company in the US to develop weather risk
> management products. With $1.5 billion invested in hydroelectric projects
> in Latin America, the Houston-based energy conglomerate is convinced the
> potential for weather derivatives exists in that market.
>
> 'The appeal of a weather derivative" says Valter Stoiani, a marketing
> executive in Enron's global risk management group, "is that unlike
> insurance-which is designed to compensate for catastrophe and requires the
> buyer to submit a claim and demonstrate an actual loss- a derivative does
> not require proof of loss. Instead, settlement is based only on the
> performance of the index against a strike level with no up-front cost."
> Stoiani says that unlike insurance, transactions can be structured in many
> different ways. In one of the more popular forms, there is no up-front
> premium but the buyer is still able to exchange its variable exposure for
> a fixed exposure. The buyer receives financial compensation in the event
> of adverse conditions, but pays out in favorable weather.
>
> "The concept of a flexible and inexpensive derivative is appealing but
> difficult to implement in Latin America at the moment," says Stoiani,
> because the market lacks fundamental elements.
> Mark Tawney director of Enron's worldwide trading operations, agrees,
> adding that "the biggest problem for hedging weather risk in Latin America
> is the difficulty in assembling enough quality data."
>
> Unlike the National Weather Center in the US, there is typically no
> central pool of historic data in electronic form in Latin American
> countries. The quality of the data differs from country to country and in
> some countries there is little information available.
>
> Marti says Centre Solutions required 20 to 30 years of weather data to
> structure Termocandelaria's subordinated loan and "unlike other countries
> in Latin America Colombia's data is quite good." Stoiani says that without
> 30 to 50 years worth of meteorological information, "there is no
> foundation for a weather index as a benchmark for structuring weather
> derivatives."
>
> Jeff Kabel, director of trading and origination for Enron Argentina, says
> the company is working hard to educate local energy companies on the
> potential of weather derivatives "as a tool to manage cash flow exposure."
> But the lack of liquidity in the power trading markets is also a problem.
> Even in Argentina, with an active wholesale market since 1998, there is
> still relatively low liquidity.
>
> In Chile, the state energy commission still regulates prices for retail
> clients. In Brazil, Mitsumori Sodeyama, president of the country's power
> exchange administrator, ASMAE, does not expect liquidity to pick up until
> the market is fully liberalized in 2006, since the wholesale electricity
> market was just introduced in late 2000.
>
> The Brazilian electricity regulatory agency, known as Aneel, is
> encouraging investment in hydroelectricity and has invited bids for 31
> hydroelectric generation plants totaling $12.2 billion. John Foster,
> senior vice president of Latin America for InterGen, an international
> power company jointly owned by Bechtel Enterprises and Shell Generating,
> doesn't think this is part of any long-term plan to exploit Brazil's
> hydroelectric potential. He says, "There has been massive under-investment
> in Brazil in the last 10 years and with demand still growing, they are
> trying to build anything they can, period."
>
> However, Aneel is offering incentives to private investors in

> Sodeyama "absolutely expects a secondary market as the energy market

As per my voice mail and Mark's e-mail, Mark would prefer to eliminate 
NetWorks from the review process.  Do you think Andy will object to 
eliminating NetWork's from the process?  Instead, he prefers to instruct all 
traders to flow all necessary documentation through Mark Greenberg or myself 
to ensure consistent legal review.  I have revised the policy accordingly.

Please review and let me know what you think.

Vikas - 

Thanks for your note.  Enron does have a policy that somewhat restricts the 
trading that may be done by employees - even when they are not involved in a 
trading function.  No Enron employee is permitted to trade any commodity for 
their own account (or for the account of another) which Enron trades.  The 
only general exceptions to this are for equity and debt securities - and 
there are special restrictions on persons who trade those items for Enron.  
This policy is modified from time to time by the Enron Corp. Board of 
Directors and is monitored by the Risk Assessment and Control Group.  I 
believe Cassandra Schultz currently has that responsibility.  I am sending 
her a copy of this e-mail (so in case I have misrepresented the policy in 
some way, Cassandra please correct me) and if you need any further 
information, please contact her.

Mark,

I am interested in opening a personal commodity trading account.  I'm not 
involved in a trading function here at Enron.  My manager Jennifer Fraser 
suggested I write you to find out what steps I need to take to ensure 
compliance before I open the account.

Your guidance on the subject is appreciated.

Thanks, Vikas
Gentlemen:

Several points regarding the below:

We worked for the first half of 1999 to try and negotiate a master agreement 
with TDCC but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms (i.e. TDCC 
wouldn't sign a master with ANY credit terms in it at all).  Rod Nelson was 
the Credit Dept. person responsible for this counterparty at that time.
If we want to start down this road again, the first step is to contact 
someone in Credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for  a 
master agreement.  Unless the commercial folks have already, I'll ask someone 
in my group to get that process started.
The e-mail from Dow indicates:
 "TDCC has never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included 
in the
confirmations sent by Enron."
All credit concerns aside, if Dow is not signing and returning our 
confirmations, then based on this statement our derivatives trading with them 
should stop immediately on legal grounds.
The e-mail as forwarded to me did not contain the attachment.  Does someone 
here have it?

Let's hope it works out better this time.

Mark

You hit the nail on the head - it is indeed the Mark Taylor in London.  I'm

I have no idea how any of my time would have been charged to an Africa

project so my ignorance shouldn't be used as a guide.  In any event, if it is 
my time, it is clearly there in error.  Is there any detail describing what I 
am supposed to have done during those hours?  That might help me redirect the 
errant time to  where it belongs.  There used to be another Mark E. Taylor at

Mark,

In April 1999 we're showing that you charged 184 hours to J3025 Benin (Sean 
Long).  Did you work on this project or any other Africa projects, e.g. for 
Tony Way, during this time period?

Basically, we are evaluating whether some employees may have accidentally 
charged to Sean's projects, whereas they meant to charge to Tony's.

Thanks, Mark!

The above PDF file is the latest version of the TBMA/ISDA bankruptcy
amendments reflecting discussions at yesterday's FDIC meeting.  Note that
other regulators (including Treasury, SEC, CFTC, the FED (NY and Washington,
FDIC) were also in attendance at yesterday's meeting.

We currently await the outcome of this morning's staff meeting of financial
regulators. The focus of this meeting was to discuss the BMA/ISDA amendment
package.

Mark -

Francisco thinks that picking up Columbia would not be a big problem and that 
he can manage all of his Wholesale work while watching Columbia.  To my 
knowledge, Columbia should not present substantial work and would benefit 
from Francisco's watch.

I'm trying to keep Francisco working on EGA matters that he knows well and/or 
are less likely to "balloon."  Francisco has been willing to tackle a bit 
more than he currently has on his EGA plate, but he is also sensitive to 
making sure that he has sufficient time for all of his responsibilities.

Let me know if you have concerns.

Mark -

Given that South America legal resources are stretched thin, we will be 
checking with Francisco to see if he has time to pick up Columbia.  He knows 
it well and I don't believe that it will be particularly time-consuming for 
him.  But it would help free up Miguel Mendoza a bit for other South America 
matters.

I will expect Francisco to be cognizant of his other Wholesale obligations in 
saying "yes" or "no."

use the system would be good.  We should definitely avoid being too technical.

They don't have the exclusive line (brand new) boat for our week but they do 
have this one.  If you can get in the night before we can actually stay on 
the boat and leave early in the morning - effectively getting an extra day of

www.moorings.com and the boat is a 463.  There's some good stuff on the site

		 Subject: RE: ISDA TDCC(Dow)/Enron

Gentlemen:

Several points regarding the below:

We worked for the first half of 1999 to try and negotiate a master agreement 
with TDCC but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms (i.e. TDCC 
wouldn't sign a master with ANY credit terms in it at all).  Rod Nelson was 
the Credit Dept. person responsible for this counterparty at that time.
If we want to start down this road again, the first step is to contact 
someone in Credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for  a 
master agreement.  Unless the commercial folks have already, I'll ask someone 
in my group to get that process started.
The e-mail from Dow indicates:
 "TDCC has never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included 
in the
confirmations sent by Enron."
All credit concerns aside, if Dow is not signing and returning our 
confirmations, then based on this statement our derivatives trading with them 
should stop immediately on legal grounds.
The e-mail as forwarded to me did not contain the attachment.  Does someone 
here have it?

Let's hope it works out better this time.

Mark

Ghosh/LON/ECT@ECT

Subject: Credit Derivatives (CDs) in Sweden

I have been through the advice received from Swedish counsel. The position of 
CDs under Swedish law can be summarised as follows.

1.  Regulation

CDs are regulated in Sweden in the same way as commodity derivatives. As 
discussed we are currently working through these issues as they relate to 
commodity derivatives with local counsel and I will be pressing them to take 
a less cautious approach than they have taken to date (particularly in light 
of our expanding presence in Sweden). As you know, our target is to avoid 
Swedish licencing requirements and the accompanying regulatory capital 
requirements. In the meantime, this uncertainty will not prevent us from 
dealing in Norway with Swedish parties based in Norway.

2.  Insurance

CDs are not analysed as contracts of insurance under Swedish law.

3.  Guarantees

  CDs are not analysed as contracts of guarantee under Swedish law.

4.  Gaming

CDs are not analysed as gaming contracts under Swedish law and (unusually) we 
do not even need to go so far as to satisfy ourselves that the contract is 
being entered into by the counterparty for a valid commercial purpose (i e 
hedging).  However, it should be noted that several types of entity may not 
enter derivatives at all for speculative purposes (e g municipalities, 
insurance companies).

5.  Confidentiality

This could be an issue for Enron even where we are selling the CD, where we 
have good reason to believe there is breach of the purchaser's duty of 
confidentiality owed to the reference credit (i e where we are not in good 
faith). The position would of course be potentially more problematical where 
we are purchasing the CD.  That said, it would be difficult in either case 
for the reference credit to establish loss (e g  damage to reputation), so it 
would be hard for them to launch a claim.  Our exposure could be restricted 
further by passing on no more information about underlying reference 
contracts than is absolutely necesssary.   I am pusuing this further with 
Clifford Chance, in particular to find out what the practice is in the London 
and New York credit derivative markets where the issue of confidentaility 
arises and I will revert to you when I have more information. Perhaps 
Merrills could shed some light on this?

6.  Subrogation & Assignment

Since CDs are not guarantees there is no right of subrogation.  It is 
possible to take an assignment of the counterparty's rights against the 
reference credit, but this will not work so as to allow Enron a right of set 
off against the reference credit where Enron is aware of the reference 
credit's insolvency at the time of the assignment (a reasonable bet) or where 
the latter becomes bankrupt within three months of the assignment.  In 
effect, this will make it very difficult indeed to extract any value at all 
(including by way of set off) from the reference credit.

Please feel free to call me on x 6566 to discuss this and to pass this note 
on to other interested staff.

Best regards

Paul

Attached is the amendment package forwarded to the hill on Friday afternoon.
Note that unlike earlier versions, which amended the Senate Bill S.220, this
package amends the House Bill H.R.333.  It is also a line-by-line mark-up
instead of a hand written mark-up of the actual bill.

House Financial Services Committee staff is working with the Legislative
Counsel of the House of Representatives to put our amendments in draft form.
We will forward the final amendment as soon as it is received.  It appears
that our amendments will be offered by Chairman Oxley and will not be
included in the Sensenbrenner amendment.

The House Rules Committee is meeting on the legislation at 2:00 on
Wednesday. A floor vote is expected on Thursday.

Subject: Revised H.R.333 amendments




Attached is a revised version of the amendment package to H.R.333.  We have
included both the annotated and unannotated versions, as well as a
blackline showing changes from yesterday's version. The only changes are
(1) an addition in the definition of master netting agreement on page 334
relating to guarantees and reimbursement obligations in respect of such
agreements, which we understand is acceptable to Mike Krimminger at the
FDIC, (2) the deletion of an incorrect section numbering change on page
351, and (3) the insertion of a revised "placeholder" provision on page 348
relating to rulemaking by the SEC and CFTC to address the treatment of
security futures products and joint securities/futures accounts in the
insolvency context.  As we have mentioned, the placeholder is intended to
be replaced by substantive language following further discussions between
the SEC and CFTC (and would presumably be removed if the agencies do not
agree on substantive language).   Although we have discussed the substance
of the new placeholder provision with the SEC and CFTC, the SEC has not yet
signed off on the specific language.  We understand that although the CFTC
does not "endorse" the placeholder language, it does not object to its
inclusion as a placeholder for this purpose.

Please feel free to call Seth Grosshandler (at 212-225-2542) or me (at

Senate Activity - The Senate Judiciary Committee completed its mark-up today
on S.220.  Senator Schumer offered an amendment reflecting the majority of
our amendment package.  The Schumer Amendment was adopted except for
provisions relating to Section 708 which received objection by Senator
Grassley.  Schumer's staff indicated they will attempt to work this out
w/Grassley before floor consideration tomorrow.

House Activity - The House Rules Committee made in order the Oxley-LaFalce
amendment, which reflects the majority of our netting amendment package.
Better news is that the amendment is alloted only 10 minutes of debate.
Note that the Financial Services Committee was not able to get language on
Section 708 and the SEC savings language included in the legislation due to
objection by the House Judiciary Committee. The amendment will be offered on
the House floor tomorrow.  Attached is the Oxley Amendment filed with the
Rules Committee and the letter we circulated to Chairman Drier, House
Leadership, and contacts on the Financial Services, Judiciary and
Agriculture Committees.  The SEC issue prevented release of our letter
earlier because they would not authorize PWG agreement without the savings
clause language.  They were convinced to withdraw their objection on a
promise that the Financial Services Committee would work to get this
language adopted in conference. Additionally, we understand that Chairman
Sensenbrenner may grumble about the Oxley amendment but will not raise any
formal objection.

To the extent you are able I would recommend sharing our letter with any
contacts you have with Members that are inclined to be involved in
tomorrow's debate and are inclined to be helpful -- particularly those on
the Financial Services and Judiciary Committees.

Note:  Due to the SEC snafu we were not able to circulate the letter to the
Senate today.  We are attempting to rework the letter to reflect the Schumer
amendment in hope that it still may be useful tomorrow.

		 Subject: Oxley Amendment - Call to House Judiciary Committee  Democrats


We have received word that Conyers and House Judiciary Democrats will oppose
the Oxley Amendment based on jurisdiction and acceptance of substantial
amendments.  We further understand that Gephardt remains supportive of the
amendment.  I would encourage as many calls as possible to the list of
members below encouraging support of the Oxley/LaFalce Amendment.

Points to keep in mind/mention:
- Most of the amendments are necessary to conform bankruptcy statute to the
Commodity Futures Modernization Act passed last year.
- Certain other provisions are necesary in order to update the bankruptcy
code for financial product netting.
- These are necessary to diminish systemic risk to the financial system.
- This is a bipartisan amendment supported by John LaFalce.
- Please support the Oxley-LaFalce Amendment.

Just wanted to say hello.  I hadn't heard from you lately and wondered how 
things were going.  Have you moved out of the hotel yet?  I know how 
depressing it can be going home to a hotel room every night.  Even though the 
hotel where I lived for the first three months I was in Jakarta was very 
nice, it was still just a hotel room.  I was so glad to get out of there into 
an apartment - major quality of life improvement.

We've been just busy enough for me this month: Austin for a couple of days on 
Presidents' Day weekend, a Rockets game last Friday, and we're off to the 
Diverse Works annual gala on Saturday.   Ted wants to leave town to do 
something - anything - next weekend but I'm trying to talk him out of it 
since we're taking that week-long cruise starting the following Saturday.  
Since my arguments carry no weight, I'm just lucky that air fares are 
surprisingly high right now - $1000 rt to Ft. Lauderdale is even too high for 
Ted.

Ted's brother is working on a  project here in town so we had him over the 
other night for dinner.  Ted had planned - can you guess - tuna steaks, 
having conveniently forgotten that his brother is allergic to fish.  How do 
you just forget something like that?  Luckily they went to the gym ahead of 
time and Ted mentioned what was on the menu so they stopped at the store and 
bought his brother a steak on the way home.

That nice January bump in Enron's stock price is ancient history now - pretty 
much the whole thing has been given back.  I'm still going to buy a new car - 
looks like an Audi A6 - but just one.

Hope you are doing well!

The cruise is a western Caribbean cruise on a Carnival Lines ship - leaving 
from Galveston on the 17th.  I'm actually looking forward to it.  I may not 
be partying with the best of them (or have a body that would entitle me to 
even try) but a week in warm weather in a deck chair with a good book and a 
waiter bringing tropical drinks is sounding really good right now.

As for Europe, Ted is thinking London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Finland, Iceland 
and Norway (think blond and English speaking).  Personally, I'm reasonably 
flexible, but I'd rather go biking or barging through the wine country in 
France or relaxing in a Tuscan hill town or villa than disco-hopping through 
another Scandinavian capital or revisiting the bars in London.  Berlin, 
Prague and Budapest appeal since I've never been to any of them.  Or maybe I 
can get over to Barcelona just before your cruise with Ted - maybe with a few 
days in the wine country or Madrid beforehand?FYI

Any news on us getting Enron On-Line?  My understanding is the attorneys need
to file with FERC for approval.  However, the bigger question is whether Enron
will allows us to file with FERC and that it won't be counter productive with
the corporate strategy for PGE.

Obviously, we're anxious to start trading on-line so let me know if you have
questions.  Thanks.

This is one I did for steel.  It should probably be beefed up to include 
reference to an ISDA master to be signed up front.
Here's one Carol did.

Rahil,

According to Clifford Chance, our European Legal Advisor, this disclaimer

requirements. 
In Europe, the paragraph like this would not be necessary in the ress

investigation with US lawyers....

Trading Megawatts On the Web: Houston Street Exchange
Launches First Fully Web-Based Trading Floor and Portal for
the Electric Power Industry

Business Wire - June 28, 1999 08:32
PORTSMOUTH, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 28, 1999-- HoustonStreet.com alters
power trading
landscape by increasing the efficiency of how power is bought and sold
Electric power. It's quickly becoming one of the world's largest traded
commodities, yet it's one of the last to be bought and sold over the
Internet. But that's about to change today when Houston Street Exchange
introduces HoustonStreet.com, a new online electric power trading floor that
allows power traders to buy and sell electricity faster and better than
before.
Houston Street Exchange hopes to do for the power industry what E
rade did for the stock market: turn the industry upside down by bringing
together buyers and sellers in a real-time, efficient online format. This
will shift the control of the $70 billion wholesale power market in the
United States by putting it directly into the hands of power marketers,
utilities and other traders that are entering the increasingly deregulated
energy market. HoustonStreet.com serves as a portal for power traders,
providing critical information regarding weather, energy news, stocks and
other direct links necessary for trading electricity. HoustonStreet.com is
pioneering the emerging business-to-business e-commerce power trading
market.
Lights out for phones, static Web sites
HoustonStreet.com delivers what has so far been elusive to the power trader:
an easy-to-use, fully Web-based trading floor that gives power traders all
the information and flexibility they need to post offers, make bids, counter
and re-counter instantaneously, until they close the deal.
Historically, power marketers have attempted to finalize deals while
juggling numerous phones and praying no one is undercutting their
transactions because they can't see a real-time picture of market pricing.
They lose precious time because they must call around to get the latest
market prices.  HoustonStreet.com eliminates that by giving power traders
instant access to current pricing fluctuations in different regional power
markets.
"The real-time environment of the Web naturally lends itself to trading
wholesale power," said Paul Messerschmidt, manager of Power Markets Services
at Energy Security Analysis, Inc. "But existing online products are
inflexible and they typically require proprietary hardware or software to
operate.  Until these issues are rectified, wholesale power trading online
will remain dormant. Houston Street Exchange is positioning itself as the
industry's wake-up call by providing a secure, reliable and flexible
platform that allows traders to trade power the same way they do today, but
more efficiently."
HoustonStreet.com enables traders to make deals based on the product and
term of their choice, providing them the flexibility to buy and sell the
same way they do now, only utilizing a much more efficient and easy-to-use
medium-the Internet.
"The leadership of Houston Street Exchange has a vision for changing the
power marketing industry" said Alan Herrick, senior vice president at
Sapient Corporation (NASDAQ: SAPE) the e-services consultancy that helped
create HoustonStreet.com. "They understand the importance of first-mover
advantage and the need to continually provide a world-class experience for
their targeted market.  Sapient is delighted to be Houston Street's
partner."
Built with power traders in mind
Designed by power traders for power traders, HoustonStreet.com enables users
to maintain total control over each transaction, view their complete trading
history, sort offers and bids by price, term, volume and delivery point, and
trade 24 hours a day, 365 days a year using an online service that ensures
the security and anonymity of each transaction.
Easy to access, navigate and use, HoustonStreet.com gives traders
up-to-the-second market information, allowing them to make the best deals at
the right time without having to leave the site.  Traders are able to
customize their Web page so they can see information that may impact
decisions on trading strategy such as updated weather reports, news
headlines about the energy industry and stock prices.
HoustonStreet.com provides users with the ability to enter their own
information regarding trading agreements and credit status without betraying
the anonymity of other parties. Knowing whether an enabling agreement is in
place and credit issues have been resolved beforehand gives a power marketer
a tremendous advantage in making split-second decisions.
Because of its ease of use and real-time environment, HoustonStreet.com will
allow power traders to make more transactions and become more efficient.
HoustonStreet.com will initially cover the Northeast regions (NEPOOL, PJM,
NY) and expects to roll out the remaining trading regions of the country
over the next several months.
"Wholesale power trading in the United States has grown by about 900 percent
since 1996. In 1998, more than 3.0 billion megawatt hours were traded, with
virtually all of it done over the telephone," said Frank Getman, Houston
Street Exchange's president and CEO. "We are redefining how power is traded
in the wholesale market, making it much more efficient and easy for power
marketers to buy and sell electricity. HoustonStreet.com represents a
powerful convergence of two major trends: growth of business-to-business
e-commerce and deregulation of the electric power industry."

of important factors that could cause these forward-looking statements to be
materially inaccurate. These factors include, without limitation, that (i)
power traders may be unwilling or unable to use Internet-based power trading

to operate profitably, (iii) technological or systems outages could occur
and (iv) competitors with greater financial, marketing or other resources
could emerge. HoustonStreet.com is a registered service mark of Houston

Mark,
I am taking Thursday off for my son's birthday.  I know it is late notice but 
I would also like to take Friday off since my children have spring break this 
week.  I do not think anyone else is off on Friday.   It it is ok with you I 
will email the group.
Thanks,

I think this is probably OK.  You should probably just check with Samantha & 
Tana to make sure they aren't planning something then.  Since it is Good

Greg:

It looks like Melba sent you an example of a put.  There is nowhere else on 
the website to explain the different calculations so they use the identical 
Long Description except for that one clause to differentiate between puts and 
calls.  So far there have not been any collars, straddles, etc. offered.

On the second change, it looked to me like the preceding sentence already 
covers the treatment of holidays:  

...at the end of such day (normally being 4:05 p.m. (MPT)) on EnronOnline (or 
for Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays, at the end of the day on the 
preceding business day)...

which makes the deleted language redundant.

		 cc: Dianne Seib/CAL/ECT@ECT, Lon Draper/CAL/ECT@ECT, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT
		 Subject: Re: Option Language

Melba, I have reviewed the proposed changes and I do not believe that they 
should be made.  The change to the calculation of the Cash Settlement Amount 
to specify it is the Strike Price minus the Index doesn't work unless the 
option is a put.  We want this long description to work for all options 
(puts, calls, collars, etc.) and for each of those the calculation of the 
Cash Settlement Amount is different.  That is the reason that we originally 
put in the generic language that the Cash Settlement Amount is "the greater 
of zero or the amount calculated as set forth on the Website", such that the 
actual calculation mechanism for the Cash Settlement Amount will be set forth 
in each specific product.  Therefore, I would suggest we change it back to 
the original wording.

On the second change, I know that the wording that was removed is important 
to our traders.  If the description is silent on holiday pricing (which will 
be the case if we make the suggested change), I am not sure as to what the 
default is.  We need to make sure that the default where the pricing for 
holidays is not specified is exactly the same as the wording removed, 
otherwise the wording removed needs to be put back in.  I am also not clear 
on why we would remove the wording in the first place and create any 
uncertainty as to holiday pricing.

Thanks

Mark, you are right on the second point.  I think we are probably okay 
there.  I understand from our option traders that they intend to set the 
products themselves up on EOL to address the different calculations in the 
products themselves rather than coming up with different long descriptions 
for each.  Does that make any sense or should we be setting up separate long 
descriptions for each of the types of options they want to offer?

Greg:

It looks like Melba sent you an example of a put.  There is nowhere else on 
the website to explain the different calculations so they use the identical 
Long Description except for that one clause to differentiate between puts and 
calls.  So far there have not been any collars, straddles, etc. offered.

On the second change, it looked to me like the preceding sentence already 
covers the treatment of holidays:  

...at the end of such day (normally being 4:05 p.m. (MPT)) on EnronOnline (or 
for Saturdays, Sundays and statutory holidays, at the end of the day on the 
preceding business day)...

which makes the deleted language redundant.

		 Subject: Re: Option Language

Melba, I have reviewed the proposed changes and I do not believe that they 
should be made.  The change to the calculation of the Cash Settlement Amount 
to specify it is the Strike Price minus the Index doesn't work unless the 
option is a put.  We want this long description to work for all options 
(puts, calls, collars, etc.) and for each of those the calculation of the 
Cash Settlement Amount is different.  That is the reason that we originally 
put in the generic language that the Cash Settlement Amount is "the greater 
of zero or the amount calculated as set forth on the Website", such that the 
actual calculation mechanism for the Cash Settlement Amount will be set forth 
in each specific product.  Therefore, I would suggest we change it back to 
the original wording.

On the second change, I know that the wording that was removed is important 
to our traders.  If the description is silent on holiday pricing (which will 
be the case if we make the suggested change), I am not sure as to what the 
default is.  We need to make sure that the default where the pricing for 
holidays is not specified is exactly the same as the wording removed,

Trading Megawatts On the Web: Houston Street Exchange
Launches First Fully Web-Based Trading Floor and Portal for
the Electric Power Industry

Business Wire - June 28, 1999 08:32
PORTSMOUTH, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 28, 1999-- HoustonStreet.com alters
power trading
landscape by increasing the efficiency of how power is bought and sold
Electric power. It's quickly becoming one of the world's largest traded
commodities, yet it's one of the last to be bought and sold over the
Internet. But that's about to change today when Houston Street Exchange
introduces HoustonStreet.com, a new online electric power trading floor that
allows power traders to buy and sell electricity faster and better than
before.
Houston Street Exchange hopes to do for the power industry what E
rade did for the stock market: turn the industry upside down by bringing
together buyers and sellers in a real-time, efficient online format. This
will shift the control of the $70 billion wholesale power market in the
United States by putting it directly into the hands of power marketers,
utilities and other traders that are entering the increasingly deregulated
energy market. HoustonStreet.com serves as a portal for power traders,
providing critical information regarding weather, energy news, stocks and
other direct links necessary for trading electricity. HoustonStreet.com is
pioneering the emerging business-to-business e-commerce power trading
market.
Lights out for phones, static Web sites
HoustonStreet.com delivers what has so far been elusive to the power trader:
an easy-to-use, fully Web-based trading floor that gives power traders all
the information and flexibility they need to post offers, make bids, counter
and re-counter instantaneously, until they close the deal.
Historically, power marketers have attempted to finalize deals while
juggling numerous phones and praying no one is undercutting their
transactions because they can't see a real-time picture of market pricing.
They lose precious time because they must call around to get the latest
market prices.  HoustonStreet.com eliminates that by giving power traders
instant access to current pricing fluctuations in different regional power
markets.
"The real-time environment of the Web naturally lends itself to trading
wholesale power," said Paul Messerschmidt, manager of Power Markets Services
at Energy Security Analysis, Inc. "But existing online products are
inflexible and they typically require proprietary hardware or software to
operate.  Until these issues are rectified, wholesale power trading online
will remain dormant. Houston Street Exchange is positioning itself as the
industry's wake-up call by providing a secure, reliable and flexible
platform that allows traders to trade power the same way they do today, but
more efficiently."
HoustonStreet.com enables traders to make deals based on the product and
term of their choice, providing them the flexibility to buy and sell the
same way they do now, only utilizing a much more efficient and easy-to-use
medium-the Internet.
"The leadership of Houston Street Exchange has a vision for changing the
power marketing industry" said Alan Herrick, senior vice president at
Sapient Corporation (NASDAQ: SAPE) the e-services consultancy that helped
create HoustonStreet.com. "They understand the importance of first-mover
advantage and the need to continually provide a world-class experience for
their targeted market.  Sapient is delighted to be Houston Street's
partner."
Built with power traders in mind
Designed by power traders for power traders, HoustonStreet.com enables users
to maintain total control over each transaction, view their complete trading
history, sort offers and bids by price, term, volume and delivery point, and
trade 24 hours a day, 365 days a year using an online service that ensures
the security and anonymity of each transaction.
Easy to access, navigate and use, HoustonStreet.com gives traders
up-to-the-second market information, allowing them to make the best deals at
the right time without having to leave the site.  Traders are able to
customize their Web page so they can see information that may impact
decisions on trading strategy such as updated weather reports, news
headlines about the energy industry and stock prices.
HoustonStreet.com provides users with the ability to enter their own
information regarding trading agreements and credit status without betraying
the anonymity of other parties. Knowing whether an enabling agreement is in
place and credit issues have been resolved beforehand gives a power marketer
a tremendous advantage in making split-second decisions.
Because of its ease of use and real-time environment, HoustonStreet.com will
allow power traders to make more transactions and become more efficient.
HoustonStreet.com will initially cover the Northeast regions (NEPOOL, PJM,
NY) and expects to roll out the remaining trading regions of the country
over the next several months.
"Wholesale power trading in the United States has grown by about 900 percent
since 1996. In 1998, more than 3.0 billion megawatt hours were traded, with
virtually all of it done over the telephone," said Frank Getman, Houston
Street Exchange's president and CEO. "We are redefining how power is traded
in the wholesale market, making it much more efficient and easy for power
marketers to buy and sell electricity. HoustonStreet.com represents a
powerful convergence of two major trends: growth of business-to-business
e-commerce and deregulation of the electric power industry."

=09=09 Subject: California Energy Crisis

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state. That works for me - Brent & I are both on 38 - my office is 3892.

I am in the process of obtaining a cellular phone for Cheryl Nelson.  I have 
heard mixed information as to whether the company pays for the actual phone, 
or just the service.  Would you mind clarifying what your procedure for the 
reimbursement of the cel phones.  At this point, I am believing that the 
company will only pay for the service, not the phone itself.  Thanks for your

I guess it looks OK to me.  I'm surprised that they will have the ability to 
identify their own company as a counterparty.  Don't we limit the companies 
they can designate to those already signed up to trade on EnronOnline?

Mark,

There is a new message to add to the set you previously reviewed, covering 
the case where a broker tries to transact when identifying their own company 
as the counterparty:

Failure Reason: Cannot Complete Transaction to Broker Company
Text Body: The requested Transaction has not completed as the Counterparty 
identified for the transaction attempt is your own company.  For further 
information or to request a change in status, please contact us.

I have passed this text along for incorporation (we have very tight timelines 
as we are hoping to go live tomorrow night).

If you have any significant concerns about the above, let me know so we can 
change it.

Thanks,

Dave

Hi Tana -

We are trying to put in place an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron 
Australia Finance Pty Ltd and Enron Capital & Trade Resources International 
Corp (Singapore Branch).    Enron Australia has already signed on the 
document. Can we send it to you to help us get the necessary signatures for 
ECTRIC (Singapore Branch)?

I have prepared the following documents but not sure if they are most up to 
date:

1. Certificate of Assistant Secretary

2. Certificate of Secretary

3. Unanimous Consent of Directors (this is incomplete cos I am not sure of 
the part starting from RESOLVED ..)


Is there any other documents that I have missed out?  Would appreciate your 
help and guidance whether I have done the above correctly.  If there is 
anything incorrect, please guide me accordingly.





Many thanks
Angie








I will be on vacation from Monday the 19th through Monday the 26th (returning 
to the office on Tuesday the 27th).  My cell phone and pager will not work 
either at sea or in the countries I will be visiting.  I can be reached via 
Maritime Communications Network at (877)225-7447 - you will need to give my 
name and the name of the ship - Celebration.  Since the rates are around $10 
per minute, I don't plan to check my voicemail as often as usual but will 
call in when in port.I don't know anything about the Daishowa transaction but have to wonder why 
this information could be relevant to much of anything not directly related 
to EnronOnline.  To the extent we can't avoid disclosing it, I would think 
that the traders in Calgary will know how many of them trade using the 
system.  If that doesn't work I would try Savita Puthigai (x31787) or David 
Forster (x31861) on the EnronOnline team.

Chris, I think Mark is the person to ask, or Mark can refer you to the right 
commercial person.  I assume Investment Canada wants to know how many traders 
in Canada trade on EOL?  I also assume that this might in fact be a 
confidential matter that should not be disclosed and which should be 
irreleveant to an ICA application for the Daishowa transaction.  In any 
event, why is del Vecchio not dealing with this?

I have been asked to confirm this as it will form part of the Daishowa 
acquition Investment Canada Act filing.  I am advised that the filing will be 
confidential so I do not think it should be an issue.  Do you take any issue 
with this?  And if not, do you know who would know the answer?

ps - I lost all of my voice mails the other day and I think there was one 
from you regarding a possible conflict - my understanding is that we're just 
assigning a bunch of transactions over from one party to another and in that

Mark,

I have attached two word documents for your review, both of which contain the 
two long descriptions.  The document with filename TAS Descriptions most 
likely will be two new product types.  The other document (Nymex-GC Spreads) 
shows the long descriptions for the existing product type US HeatOil2 Fin 
Spread and US UNL Fin Spread.  We will create a new index for each of these 
product types that will be the Nymex vs Gulf Coast prices for the commodity.  
Savita has reviewed each of these documents and her only concern is how we 
capture the "Trade Date" for the TAS products.  These products have been 
requested by Larry Gagliardi, Phil Clifford, and John Wilson.  Please let me 
know your thoughts.

Thank you.
Kevin

Sounds like a great idea.  a couple of questions:
Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest?  
If not, can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there 
- in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the 
customer's draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashier's check.

Greg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash 
collateral.  Without getting into detail, a security interest in an 
"instrument" can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property 
Security Act, and an "instrument" includes a bank draft.  If counterparties 
were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could 
rely on perfection by possession.  Is this something we should investigate 
further?  Peter.
Yes - Thanks!Thanks for the message back - I'll see you Friday!How does this process usually start?

Subject: RE: InternetWeek


Gentlemen -- 

The background on this message from Greg relates to his potential involvement 
in an advisory board for Internet Week magazine.  Essentially, this means 
that Greg would attend a couple of meetings per year and participate in a 
handful of telephone conversations all aimed at helping the editors at 
InternetWeek calibrate themselves in terms of what's important and what's not 
in the technology world.  Here are the advantages I see:

Greg gets to work with several high-level CTO's and technology CEO's who also 
participate on the board.  This is good exposure for our plans to provide IT 
services as a business.
Good exposure in terms of IT recruiting.  The more high-profile places we 
are, the better.
Good media relations and the potential for us to track editorial thought in 
the technology world.

Philippe had originally planned to do it, but I think we're concluding that 
it's a perfect place for Greg to be as part of his efforts to put new 
origination activities in motion.  

From my PR perch, I see no conflicts but Greg is right to suggest that we run 
it by you first.  Ok with you?

I have no legal objections to the presentation.  I do have to wonder if it is 
wise from a commercial perspective to so heavily emphasize the importance of 
the success of EnronOnline to the company's business on the platform itself.

Mark,

I have attached new audio and new slides of Jeff Skilling's Enron Overview 
presentation to be reviewed by Legal before being posted on the EnronOnline 
site.  We would like to post this new presentation as soon as possible 
because the existing one is rather dated (it was done last September).

 <--- This is a Windows Media Player file  

The existing presentation (if you'd like to see it for comparison) is at 
http://www.enrononline.com/docs/marketing/Markets/ - click on Presentations / 
Enron Overview in the left-hand navigation.

This is Skilling's "standard" presentation, so there is nothing in it which 
has not already been presented publicly before.

Please let me know if these files have your approval for the EnronOnline 
site, or contact me if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks,

Here's a draft of the bullet points you requested:
I found this on a sailing magazine web page:

An acquaintance who is a professor of literature at Stanford brought Patrick 
O'Brian to my attention, claiming him to be the finest living author writing 
in the English language. Being an avid reader who had consumed about 
everything including, of course, all of Forster's Hornblower books, I had my 
doubts. But after an increasingly mesmerizing reading of all of the sixteen 
O'Brian Aubrey/Maturin novels then in print with ever mounting captivation 
and awe, I wholeheartedly concurred. After a second reading of the entire 
series which revealed to me previously undiscovered depths and glories I felt 
compelled to pay down the debt I owed this author for the wonderful, 
life-enriching experience he had given me. Since O'Brian obviously loved the 
sea, it occurred to me to write offering him a fortnight's cruse aboard my 
Perini ketch, the 154 foot Andromeda la Dea, for himself and his friends 
without any interfering presence from myself. 

I asked Danielle Steel if she thought O'Brian would be offended by receiving 
such a letter and her interesting reply was, "I get about 20,000 letters per 
year from readers and I have yet to receive a single one offering to do 
anything for me - he will be delighted even if age and circumstances prevent 
him from accepting." So I wrote via his publisher, having literally no idea 
where in the world he lived, and after some forwarding delay I received his 
handwritten reply, in his fine and precise penmanship, saying "I accept your 
kind offer with perhaps obscene haste."
As Mr. O'Brian was to give a lecture tour of the United States in early 1995 
that included San Francisco, I invited him to dinner the week of his visit 
and I first saw him in person when I attended his lecture in Herbst Hall. His 
host was the poet laureate of America (Robert Haas). I was both charmed and 
alarmed when introduced to O'Brian's lightening quick wit and rather acerbic 
manner. 

The following evening he and his wife, Mary, came to my house in Belvedere 
for a 'literary' dinner with admirers and one or two other authors. Mr. 
O'Brian was utterly charming, if perhaps a little aloof. He took tremendous 
interest in an Admiralty Board (dockyard) model I have of an English First 
Rater of 1702. He understood everything about that ship and greatly augmented 
my own knowledge. After the other guests departed, we settled into a series 
of brandies by the fire and I discovered: 1) his capacity for serious 
drinking greatly exceeded my own; 2) his reserve only eased very slightly in 
the presence of this unknown American (me) and; 3) his knowledge of the 
practical aspects of sailing seemed, amazingly, almost nil.

After a half liter of cognac had vanished (and we were still calling each 
other Mr. O'Brian and Mr. Perkins), I produced a chart of the Mediterranean 
and we began to discuss the agenda for his cruise. 

I had learned that the O'Brians' home was in Collioure, a village on the 
Mediterranean coast of France just north of the Spanish border, in Basque 
country. The harbor of Port Vendres lies nearby, where Andromeda could pick 
all of them up. O'Brian then suggested a cruise circumnavigating Sicily, a 
stop in Greece, dropping by Beirut and winding up with a comprehensive tour 
of the Balearic islands. I was stunned! How, I wondered, could this old salt 
possibly comprehend a tour of over 3,000 nautical miles with numerous port 
calls, in only 14 days in a yacht capable of only about 12 knots? 

As I began to explain the physical limitations of time and space he added a 
desire to drop the hook in Naples, Capri and Tangiers as well. While I could 
not reconcile this plan with reality, I assumed it was the wine in control 
and then I was both startled and pleased when he added at the evening's end 
that he had a major non-negotiable condition to accepting my offer; namely 
that I personally would join him, Mary and their guests aboard my yacht. 
?
In May 1995, as the departure date appoached, I had a rough time getting 
Andromeda to the tiny and picturesque Port Vendres in time to pick them up. 
Every time I have been in the Gulf of Lions, I have been pasted and this was 
one of the worst. Andromeda broke her inner forestay and lost all 
telecommunication as well, but after a real dusting we made it and O'Brian 
and Mary showed me around the village and offered a lunch at their modest and 
charming home. He took tremendous pride in his wine made from his own grapes, 
pressed and fermented in barrels in his cellar. I was fascinated by his 
office, where the books were written. It was lined floor to ceiling with 
reference works on an array of subjects (botany, geography, zoology, 
medicine, etc.) in several languages, but not a single volume dated later 
than 1820. He was literally immersed in the period of his work. 

The following morning we were joined by his close friend, the scholar (and 
foremost authority on Peeps) Richard Ollard, his publisher Stuart Proffit and 
his agent Vivien Green. We finalized our itinerary with the decision to visit 
all the Balearic islands and O'Brian, somewhat wistfully, asked if an 
additional stop in Istanbul would not be possible? Told it was not, he 
boarded radiating the impression that I was something of an Indian giver, 
short-changing him on his yachting holiday.

Underway to Menorca beneath a sunny sky with a twenty knot following wind, 
the sailing was marvelous and O'Brian was delighted. I introduced him to the 
helm, but he seemed to have no feeling for the wind and the course, and 
frequently I had to intervene to prevent a full standing gybe. I began to 
suspect that his autobiographical references to his months at sea as a youth 
were fanciful. He had no idea of the limitations of even a big yacht like 
Andromeda in terms of the handling and actual distance we could cover in a 
day. However, he and Mary adapted quickly to the yacht with no trace of 
seasickness. Mary, quiet, kind, interesting and interested, was wonderful to 
have aboard. However, she was very frail. They were both nearly 80 and I 
constantly feared she would take a tumble with the ship's motion, but 
thankfully this never occurred. 

Before dinner O'Brian asked me if I was familiar with an American drink 
called the martini and he tested my composition of two such killers with 
relish. All the conversations at the table were spirited and he was the 
center of the talk and controlled its direction totally. I found the level of 
sophistication and erudition of these people to be greater than any I had 
ever experienced, and when they turned to literary or historical contexts I 
was left far behind. My MIT engineer's degree had, alas, not prepared me for 
cultivated discourse at such a level. It was literally exhausting, but a 
marvel to follow. 

The weather continued to be fine and the next morning we were off Menorca. 
O'Brian suggested that we sail (sail, not motor) into the long narrow channel 
leading to the port of Mahon, the location of the first meeting between 
Aubrey and Maturin. This was pretty tricky for a boat of Andromeda's size, 
but I carried it off, happily, without mishap. We had an interesting 
afternoon ashore with O'Brian showing us about the old city with intense 
enthusiasm while also demonstrating his fluency in Catalan, the local tongue. 
That evening, while at dinner back aboard the yacht, he suggested for the 
first time that I call him Patrick and he would use Tom for me.

And so our cruise continued, with Patrick showing keen interest in 
everything; we fished with some success; we sailed every day; we visited the 
port of Ciudadela on Menorca and we sailed past the majestic Cape Formentor 
on the northeast tip of Mallorca where Patrick was entranced by the thousands 
of sea birds. Ornithology was his true passion as it was for his character 
Stephen Maturin, who is clearly modeled on Patrick's physique and personality.
?
One evening there was an extremely heated discussion around the table which 
led to hurt feelings requiring overnight to heal. It started with Patrick 
asking me if I had heard of a place, Indiana, and a school, the University of 
Indiana and did I think the school financially responsible? The University's 
English department had purchased (and not yet paid for) two or three of 
Patrick's manuscripts and had a professor offering a course on O'Brian which 
Patrick found intensely offensive. Patrick then mentioned that he was 
destroying all of his diaries, his journals and all of his correspondence so 
that no trace of his existence would remain save his novels. 

Richard Ollard was aghast, and Ms. Green was very upset with this quite 
startling revelation. Ollard said that it was a crime against the future and 
reminded Patrick that he himself had relied heavily on Pablo Picasso's 
letters when he had written a well-received biography of the artist. 

Patrick heatedly countered that Picasso had trusted him, but that he, 
Patrick, could not rely upon the goodwill of "some post-doctoral American 
fool." So the tension-filled discussion continued. The analogy of an artist 
framing his painting was raised; it was then complete and should not require 
either the support nor deserve the distraction of knowing the artist's frame 
of mind at the time of creation. 

Now, after Patrick's death, we understand some of his thinking. He was his 
own construct, born Patrick Russ, English not Irish, not university educated, 
not a sailor, a father who abandoned his family, and altogether a piece of 
his own fiction. But, that night aboard Andromeda, only Mary knew the truth 
and understood his deep motives.

The following day the unpleasantness passed with more superb sailing in fine 
Mediterranean weather. While under full sail with the huge MPS drawing in 
light wind, with our centerboard keel raised and guided by - as it turned out 
- an inaccurate Spanish chart, we decided to sail between the coast and a 
small island, and we ran firmly aground in shallow water. In the Med one 
can't simply wait for a higher tide, so we emptied all our fresh water tanks 
and tried to back off. No luck. I blew out the water in our centerboard trunk 
with compressed air, over ten tons. Still no luck. Finally, we tied a long 
hawser to a rock astern and, using our anchor windlass to bar-tight tension, 
we slowly worked our way off waggling to and fro with our bow thruster. 
Patrick was delighted with all these nautical operations. He nearly believed, 
I thought, that we had arranged the event for his entertainment. 

One morning at breakfast, after our friendship had become more firmly 
established, Patrick said, "Tom, I wish to ask you an embarrassing question 
which will reveal my utter and total ignorance of all things in this modern 
world. What is software?" My answer, "The piano is the hardware and the sheet 
music is the software," satisfied him and upon reflection, myself as well.

Every afternoon between two and five, Patrick retired to my on-board office 
to work on his novel The Yellow Admiral, then in progress. He borrowed the 
yacht's charts of France, particularly the area around Brest, to incorporate 
detail of the blockade of Brest which is featured in that book. Very much to 
Mary's surprise he showed me each day's progress. She said that he had never 
shared his work with anyone before completion. Later, Patrick sent me the 
original manuscript for this volume which I still keep aboard and which I 
treasure.

Thus we cruised for ten days arriving in Palma where the demands of business 
required that all of Patrick's guests and I depart. He and Mary continued on 
to Ibiza with the yacht's crew for three further days, mostly to study that 
island's renowned bird colonies. Then they sailed, uneventfully, back to Port 
Vendres.

My friendship with Patrick continued until his death in January of this year. 
We corresponded. He and Mary stayed in my home. They were aboard my schooner 
Mariette. We met at his club, Brooks, in London. He was a genius and his 
books remain a towering, towering achievement. I miss him greatly.

If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me 
like something needs to be changed.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the 
confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.  
Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the 
power to contract in their own names.  If the correct legal name is not in 
Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on 
it seriously compromising the contract itself.  That is the source of Tana's 
concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.  

My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer 
has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is 
that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer 
until they are correctly completed.

In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to 
transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application 
they are understandably upset and are now complaining.  I would appreciate it 
if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with 
changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.

FYI...

Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty 
System as a Division of Cargill, Inc.
Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as 
such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link
to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure.

Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change 
documentation from the Counterparty
in order to change this name.

Hello,

Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent 
and child for our downstream systems.
GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the 
Tradename / Division name or Parent Name  - - not both simultaneously.
(Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the 
purpose of using a Tradename.

Best Rgds.

With divisions,  EOL does request a new Password Application for the 
applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.  When the company is set up 
in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP

Sam & Stephanie,

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."  
or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".

Subject: Urgent - Counterparty Divisions: Cargill Ferrous International

Bill -

If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me 
like something needs to be changed.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the 
confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.  
Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the 
power to contract in their own names.  If the correct legal name is not in 
Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on 
it seriously compromising the contract itself.  That is the source of Tana's 
concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.  

My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer 
has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is 
that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer 
until they are correctly completed.

In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to 
transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application 
they are understandably upset and are now complaining.  I would appreciate it 
if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with 
changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.

Mark

FYI...

Cargill Ferrous International is setup correctly in the Global Counterparty 
System as a Division of Cargill, Inc.
Cargill Ferrous International is the full name of this division and setup as 
such in GCP with a Sub-to-Legal Link
to Cargill, Inc. per GCP procedure.

Also, the Global SAP team (Cheryl Johnson) would need Legal Name Change 
documentation from the Counterparty
in order to change this name.

Hello,

Yes, GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent 
and child for our downstream systems.
GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the 
Tradename / Division name or Parent Name  - - not both simultaneously.
(Although, we have broken that rule for Legal in the past.) This defeats the 
purpose of using a Tradename.

Best Rgds.

Tana,
 
Please review the process below:

With divisions,  EOL does request a new Password Application for the 
applicant reflecting the name as you noted below.  When the company is set up 
in the EOL database we link the company to the Parent and reference the CP 
ID.  Sam, please confirm, Global Counterparty also provides the links to 
establish correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems.

Let me know if this is the appropriate steps that you would like to see.

Sam & Stephanie,

Re:  Cargill Ferrous International

It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."  
or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".

Doc -

I'll be in town through Sunday morning.  Any chance we can get together for 
dinner Saturday eve.?

MarkThanks Doc - sounds like fun - see you Saturday!Paul -

Sorry for the delay.  I see no problems with this in the current format.  
There might be an issue if the description of the product included the word 
COMEX or any other trademark of the exchange.  I'm not too concerned about 
the presence of "COMEX" in the long description since presumably that will 
not appear on Reuters.

Subject: Quick Question RE: COMEX bid/offers for Reuters

Hi Mark - Justin suggested I contact you to see if there would be any issues 
with us feeding our live EOL COMEX physical metals quotes to Reuters (as part 
of our new deal with them to feed them various live bids/offers for various 
markets).  Our sense is that this is fine, but we want to be sure.    

Example Products (both Short and Long Description would be viewable on the 
customer's Reuters terminal):

Product Short Description    Product ID
US Cu Phy Hi-Grd Whse  May 01  36916
US Cu Phy Hi-Grd Whse  Jul01  45368

Sample Long Description (references to COMEX) 



Q1:  Do we have any restrictions on us that would preclude us from doing 
feeding these 'COMEX' quotes to Reuters? (e.g. legal agreement with NYMEX / 
COMEX in place ?)
We are hopeful that no such restrictions exist but want to make sure before 
proceeding further.   

Q2:  Are you aware of any other restrictions that would restrict us from 
feeding quotes for any of our other physical metals products to Reuters?   
(Unfortunately, we cannot post our financial LME quotes to Reuters as this 
would violate LME rules, hence our desire to at least feed our Physical 
quotes).

Sorry for the short notice but could you get back to me today on this?  We 
are trying to finalize today the list of metals products which we can include 
in the feed.

Just spoke with David Lilley and he is onside for us to post the 2 physical

41457
41465

He is also keen to add European copper soon , but needs to work on tightening 
the spreads on these products first so would like to hold off just now.

Imelda/Julie - can you look at mapping these if there are no other issues? 
One possible issue is that the long description for the 2 US Cu's may still 
contain the reference to 'COMEX' .  Apparently legal had concerns with this , 
so they were planning to change this to 'CX' or similar.

Subject: RE: COMEX bid/offers for Reuters

Hi David - wanted to check with you to see if you would be okay with us 
feeding live bids/offers to Reuters for the COMEX products shown below.   
Originally, when I met with Joe Gold some weeks ago, we had intended to feed 
many of our LME prices to Reuters, but due to the LME member rules 
restricting us, we were precluded from doing so.  

As such, we are hoping that we could at least feed the live quotes we have in 
place for the 2 physical COMEX products (and , if possible , the financial 
COMEX lookalike).  As part of our deal with Reuters, both we and Reuters are 
very keen to feed some quotes for metals products. Also, if there are any 
other non-LME restricted physical products you know of, we may be interested 
in feeding these as well.

Could we have a quick chat about this before the end of today ?  

Many thanks,

Good Afternoon,

The spring Monmouth College Board of Trustees meeting is just around the
corner and we are in the process of scheduling meals and reserving hotel
rooms.  The meeting packets are on their way to you by mail today, but
thought I would try electronic mail instead of the standard return card for
inquiring about your room reservations and dinner selections.

If you are planning to attend the meeting please let me know by return email
or by phone (309) 457-2127, and answer the following:

Hotel rooms are on hold for April 19 and 20.  Do you need a room reserved at
the Hawthorn Inn for the 19th and/or the 20th of April,  and for how many
people?  (If you have responded to the Development Office for the 19th, I
have received that information.)

Menu selections for Friday's dinner are:

1. Herb Crusted Dijon Lamb
2. Roasted Duck Breast
3. Mushroom Ravioli with Roasted Pepper Coulis (no cheese or cream in/on
this selection)

Please select Option 1,2 or 3.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,
Deborah

our view using the exchange in the name of the product would be a problem but 
references to the exchange may be acceptable in the product description - an 
example of what would not work would be describing the product as a "COMEX 
lookalike" or something similar.

benign (i.e. we have similar references in our long descriptions for IPE,

Sorry for the delay -- I was out of town and believe it or not Enron doesn't 
have a local access number to its computer system in Monmouth, IL so I just 
got your message this morning.

Don't worry about sailing skills.  Among the rest of us we have that pretty 
well covered.  We may be a bit rusty but I'll bet we can keep the boat moving 
in the right general direction and not hit anything hard enough to do any 
serious damage.  We're going to an area that is one of the easiest places in 
the world to sail around for a few days.  Navigation is easy (you can always 
see where you're going), the waters are protected (no big waves) and the wind 
consistent and not too strong (so the boat will move but not be hard to 
handle).  The skills you mentioned (sitting, drinking & socializing) are in 
fact the critical skills for a trip like this.  We sure don't want anyone on 
board who is going to fall down on the job in any of those areas!

If you want a sneak preview, try The Moorings website -- www.moorings.com.  
Under "Destinations" we're going to the British Virgin Islands.  Under 
"Charter Fleet" we'll be on a Moorings 463.

Since you have your tickets, please send me your flight arrival information.  
I need to pass that along to The Moorings so they will pick you up at the 
airport.  About the only other items left to deal with are ordering our food 
and drinks.  Amanda has abdicated any responsibility there so Linda & I will 
take care of most of that.  Any particular beverage requests?  Beer, wine, 
liquor, sodas, juices, mixers?  

And finally, just a bit if extra info:

1.  Your cell phones will not work in the BVI.  We will have a local cell 
phone on the boat but won't know the number until we get there.  If you need 
to leave a contact number with someone, give them the Moorings' number in 
Tortola (284)494-2332.  They'll try and reach us either by phone or radio if 
a call comes in.

2.  A lot of places will take credit cards but we'll need a little cash for 
renting moorings for the night (much easier than anchoring - Amanda can 
explain), meals out, departure taxes, incidentals and whatever but there 
aren't going to be lots of ATM's everywhere so you should bring what you 
think you'll need.  US Dollars are the currency.

3.  You will need your passport but there are no visa requirements.

4.  Use soft-sided luggage (easier to stow  on the boat) and try to carry 
everything on -- if they lose a checked bag it's hard to get it later.  

That's about all I can think of right now.  Feel free to ask any other 
questions.  I'm starting to get excited now too.  It's hard to believe it's 
less than 3 weeks away!

Amanda -- Thursday May 17

2:32 p.m. AA Flight 5541 from Tortola to San JuanNo, the ETA says that if you have a master agreement in place it governs 
trades in the relevant commodities.  In fact, we used that language to 
mollify the people who were afraid we were going to stop sending confirms 
when they first signed up for EnronOnline.  To the extent we want to 
eliminate confirms for counterparties with masters, we will need their 
agreement.  

From a technical legal perspective we could probably eliminate the confirms 
for GTC-governed  transactions without asking the customer first.  Whether or 
not that is a good idea from a customer relations/marketing/PR view I will 
leave to others.  Since some customers seem to want this pretty badly, you 
might consider offering to do away with the paper for customers who sign up 
for your new data transfer arrangement before making it generally 
available......

Subject: Elimination of Confirmations for EOL Transactions

Leslie Reeves and I met today with Mark Taylor and Mark Haedicke to discuss 
the eliminination of confirmations for transacations executed on 
EnronOnline.  Mark Taylor has been supportive of the elimination of 
confirmations, and in the meeting today Mark Haedicke agreed.  This 
elimination of confirmations will have to be reviewed on a counterparty by 
counterparty basis, and for each counterparty, commodity by commodity.  

Next steps:  Document EOL process and records that can evidence the execution 
of a transaction (ease of availability, type of   record available, retention 
schedule for records, etc. (Sheri Thomas?)

        Create a priortized list of counterparties to be approached for 
elimination of confirmations - large number of    transactions, those that 
have asked for paper-relief, etc. (Leslie Reeves/Kim Theriot)

         Set up meeting with Andy Zipper, Jay Webb, Tom Gros, Mark Taylor, 
Jeff Hodge (Legal-Physical Gas), Elizabeth   Saeger (Legal-Power), and Leslie 
Reeves to review game plan for elimination of confirmations and impact on   
ConfirmLogic (my assistant will set up meeting) 
Bill,

Thanks for the info.

Just so you know, The Moorings provides airport transfers so there will be 
somebody with a "Moorings" sign waiting right after you get through customs 
who will get you into a van or bus to the base.  It's a little harder to get 
to Tortola from Houston so I leave at 6:10 in the morning but don't get there 
until a few hours after you guys (on AA5684 which gets there at 5:21).

 It turns out I also need everyone's birthday and address.  Mind sending 
yours along?

MarkYes, silly me.  But just so there's some hope that Bill makes his flight 
back, we should plan on being in the general vicinity of Tortola on the day 
of his flight.

It turns out I need everybody's birthday and address.  I assume you're still 
at 200 W 86th but don't know your birthday.

I'm pretty sure this is going in across the board for US deals.  If you guys 
want to, I have no objection.  We came up with some language to insert into 
the first paragraph of the confirm indicating that it is subject to the GTC 
and incorporating it by reference.  Bob Bowen has the final version of the 
language (I think it varied slightly between various commodities).

Just as a 'heads up' we are also starting down the road of doing away with 
confirmations altogether for certain US EnronOnline transactions.  Maybe we 
should chat about that and I can give you all the details.  It's going to be 
a lengthy and painful process.

I would suspect that, if ENA has passed on this, it should be okay for ECC to

Valuing dot-coms after the fall
The Internet roller coaster may rank as the market's most dramatic
upheaval over the past 20 years, but it certainly hasn't been the only
one. Remember biotech? Real estate? Leveraged buyouts? What about Japan
Incorporated? Sooner or later, investment values always revert to a
fundamental level based on cash flows. Get used to it.

Mobile portals mobilize for scale
As investors have cooled to new ventures, survival is now at the top of
the agenda for mobile portals. Whether a portal stays alive will depend on
its ability to offer accessibility, awareness, and the right services. The
rest of the struggle---rapid expansion to ensure long-term survival and,
eventually, global dominion---will come down to guts and determination.
http://mckinseyquarterly.com/login.asp?ArtID=1022


The innovative organization
The idea that new businesses prosper best when separated from their
corporate parents has now become conventional wisdom. Although new
ventures do need space to develop, strict separation can prevent them from
obtaining invaluable resources and rob their parents of the vitality they
can generate. The solution? A balance of partitioning and integration.

Programmers abroad: A primer on offshore software development
More and more companies are going offshore to develop and maintain their
software. The reason is simple: this approach saves time and money.
Without discipline in managing offshore relationships, however, a company
not only can squander the cost and time savings it had hoped to gain but
also may face late deliveries, escalating costs, mismatches between
expectations and deliverables, and even outright failure.

I'm afraid I already have plans but thanks for the invite.We have reservations with Eric, the golf pro, on Friday afternoon at 3:00.  
He thinks 4 or 5 holes will takes us 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  We don't have to play 
just holes 1 through 5 but can pick and choose -- based to some extent on 
where other people are playing.

Saturday afternoon you have a massage appointment at the club at 2:00 with a 
manicure/pedicure to follow at 3:00.  My massage is at 2:00.  Amanda decided 
not to participate since she will need to get ready for the party.  She is 
going to try and get lunch reservations for us all at Boar's Head for 11:45.Bill doesn't get there until Friday eve. so no golf and I had assumed he 
would be with Amanda on Saturday.

We may miss out on tea.  Any idea what the hours are?  We won't be done with 
golf on Friday until 4:30 or 5:00.  You won't be finished with your nails 
until 4:00 or 4:30 on Saturday (and then there's the law school bbq and 
Amanda's do).  I don't know the agenda for Sunday's afternoon.Using your numbers:
1.  No.  We won't do that until we think we have to.
2.  Not entirely, they have to meet certain more restrictive tests depending 
on how they are organized (i.e. how sophisticated are the investors).  A fund 
group like Fidelity that allows my Mom to invest has to have $1,000,000,000 
in assets.  A true hedge fund that limits its investors to those meeting 
certain sophistication requirements only needs $100,000,000 in total assets.
3. Yes
4. Only if we become "regulated."  Currently we still maintain that we are a 
one-to-many site and are not yet subject to these rules.

OK - so based on this document:

1) Are we registered with the CFTC?
2) Are we prohibited from transacting with hedge funds ("investment company")?
3) Are the "exemption conditions" with which the facility must comply just 
the conditions listed in the document?
4) Could you clarify: Do the conditions described in the document apply to us 
now, or only if we become "regulated"?


As per our conversation, I understand that FX is subject to even less 
stringent requirements than our current commodities are.

The pro understands there are only three of us 'golfing.'  Since we needed 
something for Fri. afternoon and you and Amanda seemed interested in the golf 
I went ahead and made the reservation that way.

The manicure was Amanda's idea.  Never having had one, I just assumed they 
dried them for you.  Would you rather have a facial?  I didn't ask about the 
morning.

Sorry to hear you're having computer problems.  I haven't gotten a virus yet 
but I have had 2 hard drives crash and burn on me -- one at home and one at 
the office -- you definitely loose everything when that happens!  My fairly 
new work computer (the little one you saw at Christmas) started making 
strange noises a couple of weeks ago so I called in the tech support guys.  
They agreed that is sounded odd so they took everything off of my hard drive, 
replaced it with a new one and then put all of my stuff back in the new one.  
Took them a day or so but the weird noises are gone so I feel better.

I'm off to San Antonio this week for a couple of days and then leave for 
sailing on the 11th, returning on the 21st.  The last few days (18 - 21) I'll 
be staying at a place called Keswick Hall in Virginia.  I may be able to send 
that number before I leave.

Love,

MarkI thoroughly agree about tea -- if you can reschedule your manicure the 
timing would be perfect.  And you're right about Sunday afternoon too -- I'm 
sure by then we'll be ready for a rest.  Do we have plans for Sunday eve.?  
Do we care?

I love manicures but maybe tea would be more fun - If I cancel or move the 
manicure maybe we could have a sip in the lounge before we head off to the 
BBQ - I don't think we have to be the first ones at the BBQ.  Also, maybe tea 
will fit in on Sunday too.  It will probably be a good point in the day to 
sit down and to relax.  I'll call to see if they can reschedule the maicure.

Did the pro happen to mention anything about dress codes on the course.  Most 
courses require a shirt with a collar (a polo  - not a t shirt) and one or 
two courses in the world require golf shoes - most are fine with sneakers.

I hope you like golf.  I took a lesson at the Doral ( the partner's retreat 
was there this year) and they have a golf school there. It was a great little 
school.   I'd like to go back down for a weekend to the golf school. I don't 
think that I will ever be good at it.  But there are clearly some tricks to 
the game ( it is like sailing - all degrees and very scientific) that you can 
pick up at a golf school and its enough I think to go out with other 
beginners.   If you like golf maybe you will want to go the weekend golf 
school too ( on your way back from south america maybe).  Every resort I ever 
go to has a golf course - I feel like I am always paying an extra $50 per 
night for the golf - but never use it.  I'd like to take a few lessons so I 
can play when I am on vacation.

The pro understands there are only three of us 'golfing.'  Since we needed
something for Fri. afternoon and you and Amanda seemed interested in the
golf I went ahead and made the reservation that way.

The manicure was Amanda's idea.  Never having had one, I just assumed they
dried them for you.  Would you rather have a facial?  I didn't ask about
the morning.

Do you still want to do golf without Bill?  I think I'd like to do it - the
pro will probably be happy to lose a body.

I think I will call and cancel the manicure/pedicure.  I think it is too
tight for me to hurry back to get ready with wet nalis.  You don't happen
to remember if they had any morning appointments?  I'll call.

Bill doesn't get there until Friday eve. so no golf and I had assumed he
would be with Amanda on Saturday.

We may miss out on tea.  Any idea what the hours are?  We won't be done
with golf on Friday until 4:30 or 5:00.  You won't be finished with your
nails until 4:00 or 4:30 on Saturday (and then there's the law school bbq
and Amanda's do).  I don't know the agenda for Sunday's afternoon.

Dear Sir,

I am Mr. William (Bill) Eke, Bank Manager of Orient Bank of Nigeria, Lagos
Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.

On June 6, 1997, an American Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed)
Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$75,000,000.00 (Seventy Five
Million Dollars) in my branch.  On maturity, I sent a routine notification
to
his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder
and
finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident.
On
further investigation, I found out that he died without making a Will, and
all
attempts by the American Embassy to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly
did
not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including
his
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  This sum of total US$75,000,000.00 is
still
sitting in my Bank as dormant account.  No one will ever come forward to
claim
it, and according to Nigerian Law after 5 years, the money will revert to
the
ownership of the Nigeria Government if the account owner is certified dead
and
nobody comes forward to claim it.

This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am looking for an American
who
will stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly.  A bank account abroad
will
then facilitate the transfer of this money to the beneficiary/next of kin.
This
is simple all you have to do is to immediately send me the details of a bank
account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the proper money transfer
paperwork.  The money will then be paid into this account for us to share in
the
ratio 70% for me; 30% for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be
done
by me using my position and connection in the Banks in Nigeria.  We shall
employ
the services of an attorney to draft the Will and obtain all necessary
documents
and letters of administration in your favour for the transfer.  This
transaction
is guaranteed.

If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email
address
below.  Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require
your
assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: billeke0@lycos.com


Thank you and regards.

Mr. William (Bill) Eke.

http://businesscards.lycos.com/vp/fastpath/Bill:

I am sending you by FedEx tonight a copy of the most recent edition of the 
cruising guide to the Virgin Islands.  It's not required reading but I 
thought you might find it interesting to see a bit about where we will be 
sailing.  Please be sure to bring it along with you since we will need it if 
we try and go to any spots we haven't been to before and since it will have 
the most up to date information on navigation, restaurants, bars, etc. (you 
will see little hand-drawn charts of the most popular anchorages - these are 
surprisingly useful).

There's a lot of information in there.  If you want to focus on just a few, 
the places we are (in my humble and easily overridden opinion) most likely to 
visit are:

Road Town - that's where we will pick up the boat so we're pretty certain to 
be there
The Bight on Norman Island - deserted island but a floating bar/restaurant, 
good snorkeling nearby
Jost Van Dyke - we have always liked Sydney's Peace & Love in Little Harbor 
and Foxy's in Great Harbor
Sandy Cay - the classic deserted island, very small - probably just a lunch 
or quick swim stop
Cane Garden Bay - a little tricky  getting in but well worth it - the 
quintessential Caribbean beach (swath of white sand, palm trees, steel bands, 
etc.)
Trellis Bay - closest anchorage to the airport and where there used to be a 
restaurant called The Last Resort
Cooper Island - nice quiet resort on the island with a good outdoor dining 
option
The Baths - wouldn't be a trip to the BVI without a stop here
Bitter End Yacht Club - probably about as far as we'd want to go

There are some great beaches and secluded anchorages over on St. John but it 
is in the US Virgins which means clearing the boat out of immigration and 
customs in the BVI, then clearing into the US at Cruz Bay on St. John and 
then back into the BVI when we go back over there.  Kind of a lot of trouble, 
particularly since the anchorage in Cruz Bay is so crowded it's impossible to 
find a good place to leave the boat while we go to clear in.  We've done it 
before but my view is that with limited time it just isn't worth it.  Of 
course, we started this with the assumption that my view isn't necessarily 
controlling here and I know that Linda particularly likes the restaurant at 
Caneel Bay (fancy resort) on St. John.  So stay tuned.

We will need to be sure we are anchored somewhere near Tortola (which 
probably just means not at the Bitter End or on St. John) the night before 
your flight so we can make sure you get to the airport.  One alternative is 
to stay at Trellis Bay - or right across at Marina Cay - that night and just 
dinghy you over to the dock - it's a 5 min. walk to the airport.  Or we can 
drop you anywhere else there's a phone since there are taxis that can be 
called and the island just isn't that big - I don't think it could take more 
than an hour by car to get from any one spot on the island to any other!

I put the Moorings luggage tags in with the cruising guide.  They aren't that 
important unless you check bags.  Please be sure to use them if you check 
anything since that will make it much more likely that they will catch up 
with us some day.  I'm not sure, but it may also make it just a tad easier to 
get through BVI customs when they see those familiar tags.

Here are some BVI links if you have time to do a little surfing:

Mark ? the cost of the room at St. Regis (Thursday, 5/17/01) for one night is 
$286.14 (14.5% tax).  I have booked two separate rooms under Linda's name.   
Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

You always make me laugh.

Why don't you just pay for you.  You've been footing the bill for Amanda & 
her friends all these years; it's your turn to take a break!

By the way, I don't remember pointing out that she is spoiled - thinking it 
often enough, but not pointing it out.  Of course we both know how my tongue 
loosens and my memory locks up in direct proportion to the volume of alcohol 
consumed.....

speaking of this bucket.  I think it is lovely that you are giving Amanda a 
graduation gift but -  trust me -  should would rather have another pair of 
earrings than have a free seat for me on the boat.  I didn't even know you 
when I graduated so it is much too late to give me a graduation present.  
Won't you let me pay half ( the half of the boat that Bill and I are 
occupying)?  As you have pointed out amanda is too too spoiled.

Did anyone get you a yacht when you graduated?

An extra $200 is just a drop in this bucket.   St. Regis sounds good to me.

I am happy to stay at the St Regis at this price but I am also happy to get
a cheap room near the airport.  The price has gone up quite a bit since the
last time I stayed there.

Subject: Reorg - Capitalisation of LLC

Telecon with Douglas Harris (AA New York):

1. The "$10m total assets" requirement technically needs to be satisfied at 
all times.

2. No clear definition of total assets but his view is that total assets on a 
US GAAP basis should be satisfactory.

3. If the LLC were to issue an interest free note to an Affiliate and on 
lends the proceeds to Affiliate 2 then the receivable from Affiliate 2 would 
qualify for the $10m total assets test.

4. If the LLC were to issue an interest free note to an Affiliate and the 
proceeds are used to fund on going trading then if due to losses total assets 
were to fall below $10m then technically LLC would need to top up total 
assets for the losses incurred.

It would appear from the above that the most effective route is to fund the 
LLC by way of an interest free loan and for the LLC to on lend to affiliates.






Taffy did a great job setting all of this up so the visiting attorneys had 
places to work and use the phone and their computers.  I don't know that it 
is part of her job description -- she just saw the need and filled it.

Mark -

I have a legal question for you.  I was told recently that Carol St Clair was 
going to help support the West Trading desk on physical transactions.  Since 
she came from the financial legal group I was wondering if she would be able 
to help with financial transactions as well.  I feel there are synergies to 
having the same Enron lawyer represent us for both the EEI and ISDA.  A 
recent example of this could be the SMUD relationship.  Carol recently 
completed an amendment to the existing ISDA and now is looking at sending 
them a EEI.  The SMUD credit and legal personnel are the same so the process 
should be quite smooth.  I was interested in your thoughts on this.  You can 
reach me by phone (503-464-3810) or email.  Thanks.

I apologize for the title mess-up. Please find the revised schedule with the 
correct titles:

 She's right - there are a couple of high class resorts that require long 
pants and a collared shirt but we can easily avoid those.  The first few 
years we went sailing down there I always took long pants and even a sport 
coat "just in case."  The sport coat NEVER got used.  I usually wear a pair 
of khakis on the plane since they are sometimes cold and have used them a 
couple of times down there over the years but for the most part it's a tres 
casual part of the world.p.s.  Did you get the cruising guide I sent?Approved.Glad you got the  package.

I view chess as one of the incontrovertible pieces of evidence that the Peter 
Principle is in operation in my life.  I know how all the pieces move but I 
can't see more than one move ahead -- proving that I am basically an idiot 
and have advanced well beyond where I long ago should have maxed out 
professionally.  So if you want someone to use to provide nearly unlimited 
examples of how to make mistakes in playing (while nevertheless following the 
rules), I'm your man.

is it "all casual all the time" down there.  Amanda said the restaurants are
converted shacks and shorts will be fine.  I just wanted to double check.

Bill
Here is a first draft of an amendment agreement.  Please feel free to rip it 
to shreds.
Peter:

My only concerns would be:

 (1) To the extent of any overlap in customers (which seems unlikely but it's 
happened here), we would want all of the transactions to be in the same 
entity for netting and setoff purposes.
 (2)  It's been a while since we've done any due diligence focused on retail 
financial transactions in Canada.  We are pretty restricted in that area in 
the US.  As I remember it, the new law and subsequent regulations we 
unearthed a couple of years ago may impose similar restrictions in Canada.
 (3)  If traders in the US might close one of these transactions with a 
Canadian counterparty or traders in Canada transacted with a US counterparty, 
they would not be covered by the services agreement in place between Enron 
Canada and ENA.

Let me know if I can be of any help.

		 Subject: Financial Transactions - Enron Direct Canada

Mark (and Mark) are there any concerns with Enron Direct Canada (EDC) (the 
mass markets retail affiliate, that is soon to be a subsidiary of EES) as 
opposed to Enron Canada (as wholesale affiliate of ENA) entering into 
financial transactions?  To date EDC has been entering into physical 
transactions only for gas and power under forms that have been developed 
based upon our wholesale physical contracts, Enron Direct UK's form, and 
compliance with the local regulatory requirements for retailers.  If EDC was 
to enter into financial transactions, they would tend to be papered under 
omnibus financial GTCs with EDC (as ISDAs would likely not be marketable).  
Of course credit would need to be obtained in advance, and the transactions 
are not booked until the counterparty executes the paper.  Please let me know.

Subject: Proposed FX and Interest Rate Desk in India

Mark, 

Further to my e-mail to you of last week on the above subject, I have now 
reviewed the due diligence which was undertaken by Enron Houston with local 
Indian Counsel (Crawford Bailey & Co.) on the above topic in January 1997.  
That due diligence reveals the following:

Prior Reserve Bank of India ("RBI") approval required to do business in 
India:  If  Enron is considered to be "doing business in India" (which it 
would, for example, if we had a branch or entity there) we shall require the 
prior consent of the  RBI under Section 29 (1) (a) Foreign Exchange 
Regulation Act 1973 ("FERA") e.g. to set up the branch or entity.  Please 
note that at the date of the opinion from Indian counsel (14th January, 
1997), Indian counsel opined that no guidelines had been set down as to any 
conditions necessary to be satisfied by a foreign company in order to obtain 
approval from the RBI to do business in India.  This needs to be revisited as 
to the requirements.

Repatriation of proceeds / Exchange Control:  Please note that in the 
approval which would need to be obtained from the RBI, such approval would 
state whether the revenues generated in India could be repatriated e.g., to 
the USA, or not.  I assume that we would require such ability to repatriate 
and so we shall have to ensure that the RBI approval covered it.  We also 
need to check if there are now any limits to such repatriation.  

FX / Interest Rate dealings:

A. It would appear that if we open a desk in India for FX and Interest Rate 
Products for the Enron Group (i.e., an internal Treasury Desk) to trade with 
dealers in India then dealings would be required to be in accordance with 
either the Rules framed by the RBI or otherwise specifically approved by the 
RBI.  

B. FX Products could be entered into with authorised dealers in India and 
would be subject to limitations on dealings in foreign exchange imposed by 
the FERA.  Please note that if transactions are outside the scope of the 
general rules framed by the RBI and which are not otherwise specifically 
approved by the RBI this may result in a contravention of FERA.  It is not 
clear what are the exact ramifications of  dealings in contravention of FERA; 
this needs to be investigated. 

C. What are the Rules of FERA (see A above)?  It appears that the RBI 
requires authorised dealers in India to ensure that their customers are 
actually exposed to exchange risk in respect of a genuine underlying 
transaction before entering into rate protection transactions to hedge their 
exposure to movements in currency rates or interest rates, and authorised 
dealers are required to satisfy themselves that underlying commitments are 
firm and that forward cover is not being provided for merely anticipated 
deals.   The opinion does not state how this verification is obtained by the 
dealer.   It appears, however, that there was a relaxation of the Rules 
shortly before the 1997 due diligence was undertaken whereby authorised 
dealers could offer certain derivative products in certain circumstances to 
corporates either by booking a transaction overseas or on a back-to-back 
basis without seeking the approval of the RBI.  These transactions are the 
following:

1. Interest Rate Swaps.

2. Currency Swaps.

3. Coupon Swaps.

4. Purchase of Interest Rate CAPS/Collars.

5. Forward rate agreements.

 In order to take advantage of that relaxation however the authorised dealers 
are required to ensure that:

(i) The RBI has given final approval for the conclusion of the underlying 
loan transactions.

(ii) The notional principal amount of the hedge does not exceed the 
outstanding amount of the loan.

(iii) The maturity of the hedge does not exceed the remaining life to 
maturity of the underlying loan

(iv)  The Board of Directors of the corporate to have approved (a once and 
for all basis is sufficient) the relevant financial limits and the authorised 
designated officials who can conclude the hedge transactions.

Please note that the derivatives mentioned above concern the hedging of 
underlying "loan" transactions.  Hence query, e.g., whether a simple currency 
swap just to hedge exposure in one currency where there is no actual 
underlying loan has the benefit of any exemption - and if not, query how one 
obtains the prior approval of the RBI to do this.  This needs to be 
investigated.  If transactions cannot take advantage of an exemption we shall 
need to investigate how one obtains the specific approval of the RBI to a 
transaction.   

Speculative transactions are void:  Please note that transactions entered 
into for purely speculative reasons would be void pursuant to Section 30 of 
the Indian Contract Act 1872.  Indian counsel opines that provided the rate 
or currency derivative transaction is entered into in respect of hedging or 
protection against an actual underlying then the transaction would be valid. 

Capacity and Authority: It appears that Enron would also have to ensure that 
the transactions were covered by its objects' clause and similarly that our 
counterparties' objects' clauses covered the products in which we wish to 
deal - there is no third party protection against entities dealing outside 
their capacity.  Furthermore, in relation to authority to enter into 
transactions, it would appear that we would need to authorise certain Enron 
officials to enter into specific transactions through Board Resolutions or 
Powers of Attorney and that we would need to check our counterparties' 
documentation in this regard.  

Derivatives and Borrowings:  If we were to establish a company in India, we 
would be subject to the Companies Act 1956 in relation to limitation on the 
quantum of monies which it could borrow.   Any borrowing in excess of 
stipulated limits would be required to be sanctioned by the members in the 
company in general meeting.  Accordingly, in relation to derivatives' 
transactions incidental to the borrowing of monies in foreign currency, one 
would need to ensure that the underlying borrowing itself was sanctioned by 
the members of the company in general meeting. The power to borrow itself, 
must be exercised by a full meeting of the board of directors. 

Collateral: It would appear that charges taken over collateral provided / 
received, for example, in relation to obligations under an ISDA Master 
Agreement where the cash charged was situated outside India, would be legal, 
valid and binding, as against the liquidator of an Indian counterparty in its 
insolvency; however, the approval of the RBI to the creation of the charge, 
pledge or mortgage would be necessary in the first instance.  The due 
diligence does not state how such approval would be gained nor does the due 
diligence consider outright transfers of collateral (e.g., under English law) 
rather than charges over the collateral nor does it deal with collateral 
situated locally in India;  these issues need to be checked. 

Choice of Law and Arbitration:  It would appear that Indian entities may 
enter into agreements (e.g., ISDA Masters) governed by New York or US law and 
it would appear that provisions for arbitration would work.

Insurance business:  Indian counsel opined that interest rate/FX derivative 
transactions would not be categorised as insurance business in India.

Income Tax:  Please note that if an Enron entity, or a branch of an Enron 
entity, was set up in India or if Enron appointed an agent there to undertake 
such business, then any income arising to the Enron entity / branch in India 
from a derivative transaction would be subject to Indian Income Tax.  Please 
note however that there are Double Taxation Agreements with USA, UK and 
Singapore with India.  However, no details of rates of taxation or further 
explanation of the mechanics of the Double Taxation Agreements are given in 
the opinion.

Gross-Up Clauses:  Contractual gross-up clauses re withholdings (e.g., the 
standard gross-up clause in the ISDA Master) would need to be approved by the 
RBI.  Indian counsel does not state how this is achieved. 

Close-out netting:  Whilst it appears that the netting concept of an ISDA 
Master Agreement would work according to Indian counsel, the existing due 
diligence is slightly ambiguous in that it states that an official liquidator 
or official assignee of an Indian entity would be able to disclaim 
unprofitable contracts which Indian counsel opines would mean the net sum 
(e.g., if our Indian counterparty owed us a balance on a close-out against 
them in their insolvency).  This needs to be revisited with Indian counsel.

Oral Contracts:  Please note that in relation to oral contracts, whilst it is 
possible to sue upon an oral contract in India, it is not possible to take 
any steps for the purpose of enforcing any judgement obtained except with the 
permission of the RBI under section 47 of FERA.  Indian counsel does not 
state how such approval this would be obtained and how long it would take to 
obtain. 


Mark, I suggest that we should have a brief discussion concerning the above 
before I take any further action on the above.

Kind regards

Mark


Apart from obtaining the consent from the RBI to set up a branch or a 
subsidiary in India, and then to obtain the permission to repatriate to the 
US any proceeds of such business, there did not appear to be any other trade 
control or other laws which would inhibit Enron's ability to do business in 
India.

I don't have copies of any of the FASB pronouncements.  I suggest you find 
one of the accountants who handles these things.  I don't know who that is so 
i would start wit Paige Grumulaitis -- she seems to know most accounting

In connection with my continued efforts as co-chair of the Ontario Standard 
Bilateral contract committee I am once again going to be called upon to 
debate Ontario Power Generation as to whether the Ontario market rules allow 
for physical trading (which is our position) or is a purely financial market 
(OPG's position).  
As part of their argument they are pointing to certain FASB rules that 
distinguish between physical and financial/derivative transactions.  Do any 
of you have a copy of or reference to such materials and/or commentary 
thereon.

My debate is to occur Monday so if you could get back to me as soon as 
possible it would be greatly appreciated.

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals i=

You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the following

Dear Mark,

Thanks for keeping us updated on Tom. I am pleased to hear that he is making 
a good recovery. Please pass on our best wishes. I am wondering whether the 
hospital will have forwarded mum's card if he had already moved on to a 
convalescent home when it arrived. I have just sent a card to his home 
address but I do not have the post code. I hope it gets there.

I found out from Graham last night that he is returning to Somerset on 
Wednesday (23rd). I guess that makes it unlikely that you will get to see him 
this time. There is a strong possibility that he will come in October for the 
Jazz festival and will bring Jordan with him. Whilst he has been here he has 
had lots of people trying to persuade him to build houses for them, but I 
think he misses Jordan so much he can't wait to get home. I am amazed at how 
much work got done so quickly. The house in Lauragh is finished except for 
the painting, wood staining and floor varnishing. We can start using it now 
but we need to avoid putting in too much furniture until the floor is done in 
some of the rooms at least. Dad has been lending a hand with paths and garden 
walls and has helped with some painting. I am sure that Mum will help with 
some planting. All I need now is a couple of really nice weeks in the summer 
so that I can feel the benefit of it.

I hope you can find time to come over again sometime soon. When Alan returns 
from Vienna next week he should be in a much more relaxed mood, having got 
his conference presentation out of the way at last. I am sure he will be 
happy to spend some leisurely days with you and to take you down to Mum and 
Dad's and to see the house, etc. If Hilary still has her yacht when you come 
she might also be glad of some help to sail it. She has not ventured out in 
it since Richard died but is talking about sailing it if she can find some 
help.

Once the next month is over I can also relax a bit. We are just coming into 
exam time and we all get very fraught at this time of year (with the marking 
piling up).

At last the foot and mouth restrictions are lifting a bit and we are hoping 
that all riding activities can gradually resume. We have had a rather boring 
few months - not even able to ride out along the roads. We can now ride down 
to the beach but we still have to take care not to go near fields full of 
cattle or sheep! I have just started investigating the idea of a pony for 
Caitlin. She is riding my horse occasionally in the sand arena and is doing 
very well with him even though he is rather small for him. I think she might 
be ready for a pony now but finding the right one is not going to be easy.

We will look forward  to seeing you whenever you can manage to get flights.

Bye for now,

Deb

All Delaware corporations are registered with the Secretary of State's office 
in Wilmington, Delaware.  Since that office is notoriously slow, if your 
counterparty is trying to get information on ECTRIC they might have better 
luck going through CT Corporation Systems, a company that is in the business 
of dealing with corporate information and issues which has access to the 
Delaware state records.  They have offices all over the place, including 
Wilmington.

Hope this is helpful.

Hello Mark:

a German counterparty asked me where in Delaware ECTRIC was incorporated. 
Obviously they want to  research the company.

Can you give me the name of the city ?

Thanks

Stacey,

Mark H. and I met this afternoon to discuss the December conference agenda 
and have the following suggestions:

1.  Review of California Energy Litigation -- (Mark H. would be good for this 
one.  If he can't make it, we can probably find a substitute.)
2.  German Energy Markets
3.  Convergence of Commodity Trading Forms

There were also a couple of topics included on the Houston agenda this year 
that might also be appropriate:

Christophe's panel discussion on new markets
E-commerce panel

I have also copied several of the lawyers in our London office who are active 
in the derivatives and commodity trading world to solicit their suggestions 
for appropriate topics to be added to the agenda.----- Forwarded by Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT on 05/25/2001 09:42 AM -----

The single greatest improvement you could possibly make would be to allow the 
making of reservations for reward travel.Thanks for this memo -- definitely comforting for the vast majority of our 
swap business.  I think the additional interesting question is whether or not 
we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code when 
we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) netting 
and joint credit support arrangements.  If we net all of our trading 
exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, 
coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be 
posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do 
we lose this protection since arguably we are no longer just "under a swap 
agreement?"  Would you like me to ask Emory to expand?

Subject: ENRON ON LINE - PETROLEUM TANKER FREIGHT

In an effort to get the concept off the ground here in the States, 
particularly Houston, to that of equal extent presently being experienced in 
London, we need to come up with a marketing/educational assault on the States 
market. When attempted in the past, we found the concept was heavily resisted 
by die-hard crude traders and vessel owners. The biggest complaint, other 
than sheer stupidity on anything futures related, was that no one had any 
faith or could agree on a pricing index.  Fortunately, the market is starting 
to see some spurts in this direction overseas and can expect the same here 
shortly.

When reading the above chart, you will find the various voyages that are 
assessed daily by the Baltic Exchange.  This report comes out every day at 
11:00 AM New York. While anyone in the biz can become a member of the 
exchange, the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY; a 
total of 8 different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker 
market activity for the day and average what has been reported as done.  The 
tanker market, for the most part, is very transparent.  

1 in Norway
1 in France
1 in the U.S.
5 in London

As you can see, it is more popular in London.  This relates to the exact same 
concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight 
market.

The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T9 
route -  70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus 
Christi - described as caribs to USG.

The flat rate (ws100) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 2001 actual 
voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt.  As u can see by the last posting (May 
11th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ....If you did 
a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 and the 
market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on the 5.10 
p/mt flat which = 1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo = 107,100 USD; vice versa if 
you bought at ws 190.

The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London 
trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont).  We have a trading department here that 
should have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it 
pertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight.  In 
addition, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul 
crude market particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems.

90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the 
international owners have commercial representation in the States.

Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 155 to ws 315 over a months time 
- contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any market 
when broken down.  For example:

Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 
boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are 
acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill 
liability sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a "last 
done" philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC 
Mexico where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days.

70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 500,000 bbl 
market.  Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.33 bbls p/mt hence 7.33 
x 70,000 mt = 513,000 bbls.

This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (where 
the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into most 
of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc...  
This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allows the 
traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider range of 
buyers.  When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usually 2 
million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West Africa, 
North Sea, etc.. they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered or off 
loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in.  (I apologize if this 
is remedial for any readers)  In any event, when the USG sees a surge in big 
ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up by the 
lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to get tight 
which means rates will swing hard.  Currently it is a weak market at the 70 x 
ws 160 level.

On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the caribs, 
or the T9 route.  For the most part the breakdown is as follows :

Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly 
dominated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they 
deliver them cpp from the USG.  Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will 
probably have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, 
Orion, Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc.  

Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) 
etc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc..

Columbia -  same players

(We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns.)

Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility, 
a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed to 
them.  Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading.  Some of 
the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such as 
contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s).  For example, Lyondell has a C.O..A. 
with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 moves 
p/mo.) for 2 years.  The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point formula 
off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online. 

Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if 
have an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash 
flows.  Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it 
to the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping 
in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to deal 
with on physical vessel trading.  In addition, the freight people are not 
going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line that 
trading Department Heads might have.

In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced much 
more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001, A combined 
result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rates 
which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well as 
limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any 
supply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems, 2 gas oil stems 
and 2 mogas stems p/month with the vens. In addition we had more spot biz 
with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast 
S.America.  Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off  we would once 
again be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far 
in ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets.

The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly Bob Flynn, has been trying to get this off 
the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with 
Citibank.  Reason being, Citibank wasn't calling the market but was 
interested in it from a commission standpoint (as was the case with mjlf) but 
setting up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership.  FIynn 
presently has a seller for 2 voyages p/month starting in July.  The pricing 
would be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a 
bid of 160 - so there's a lot of middle ground to get this done.  This is 
always the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals 
concluded overall.
Flynn, whose motivation is commissions, can be viewed as either a competitor 
of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment.  For it would be in 
his best interest for there to be high activity, and as he is the only one 
presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be easy to 
manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel.  If this was to take 
off to the level that Enron has taken other markets -- whereby futures rates 
are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are being done off 
of different pricing scenarios i.e.- months average- specific day close's, 
first half/2nd half, etc -- if it became so big that sellers weren't just 
owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global book balancing 
tool, who knows what can be done.  The last time we tried to get this going 
was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the group who was 
coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen; I believe it lost momentum with 
legal.  Since London has been able to get it going under the direction of 
Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here.  Scott advises me 
that he has the support/infrastructure that enables him to still cover the 
physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as well as the 
global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we both follow 
now.

I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to 
pursue this and get it on the website. I am by no means trying to pass the 
buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the 
freight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a 
explaining worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in 
London.


As per my call.

Subject: ENRON ON LINE - PETROLEUM TANKER FREIGHT

In an effort to get the concept off the ground here in the States, 
particularly Houston, to that of equal extent presently being experienced in 
London, we need to come up with a marketing/educational assault on the States 
market. When attempted in the past, we found the concept was heavily resisted 
by die-hard crude traders and vessel owners. The biggest complaint, other 
than sheer stupidity on anything futures related, was that no one had any 
faith or could agree on a pricing index.  Fortunately, the market is starting 
to see some spurts in this direction overseas and can expect the same here 
shortly.
 
Below you will find the most widely accepted index known as The Baltic 
International Routes (BITR).

When reading the above chart, you will find the various voyages that are 
assessed daily by the Baltic Exchange.  This report comes out every day at 
11:00 AM New York. While anyone in the biz can become a member of the 
exchange, the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY; a 
total of 8 different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker 
market activity for the day and average what has been reported as done.  The 
tanker market, for the most part, is very transparent.  

1 in Norway
1 in France
1 in the U.S.
5 in London

As you can see, it is more popular in London.  This relates to the exact same 
concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight 
market.

The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T9 
route -  70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus 
Christi - described as caribs to USG.

The flat rate (ws100) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 2001 actual 
voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt.  As u can see by the last posting (May 
11th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ....If you did 
a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 and the 
market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on the 5.10 
p/mt flat which = 1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo = 107,100 USD; vice versa if 
you bought at ws 190.

The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London 
trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont).  We have a trading department here that 
should have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it 
pertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight.  In 
addition, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul 
crude market particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems.

90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the 
international owners have commercial representation in the States.

Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 155 to ws 315 over a months time 
- contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any market 
when broken down.  For example:

Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 
boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are 
acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill 
liability sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a "last 
done" philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC 
Mexico where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days.

70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 500,000 bbl 
market.  Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.33 bbls p/mt hence 7.33 
x 70,000 mt = 513,000 bbls.

This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (where 
the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into most 
of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc...  
This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allows the 
traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider range of 
buyers.  When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usually 2 
million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West Africa, 
North Sea, etc.. they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered or off 
loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in.  (I apologize if this 
is remedial for any readers)  In any event, when the USG sees a surge in big 
ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up by the 
lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to get tight 
which means rates will swing hard.  Currently it is a weak market at the 70 x 
ws 160 level.

On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the caribs, 
or the T9 route.  For the most part the breakdown is as follows :

Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly 
dominated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they 
deliver them cpp from the USG.  Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will 
probably have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, 
Orion, Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc.  

Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) 
etc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc..

Columbia -  same players

(We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns.)

Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility, 
a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed to 
them.  Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading.  Some of 
the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such as 
contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s).  For example, Lyondell has a C.O..A. 
with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 moves 
p/mo.) for 2 years.  The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point formula 
off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online. 

Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if 
have an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash 
flows.  Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it 
to the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping 
in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to deal 
with on physical vessel trading.  In addition, the freight people are not 
going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line that 
trading Department Heads might have.

In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced much 
more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001, A combined 
result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rates

Homer - 

The problem with the language you suggest is that it will be triggered by any 
term that is longer than a month.  As far as I know, we have never had a 
product that went from mid-month to mid-month.  Is that a real issue for us 
here?  We have language in a few products already that takes care of the 
second issue (deals shorter than one month):

Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a 
Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less 
than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the 
Transaction.

In some cases (e.g. power swaps), when the deal is for less than a month the 
payment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month 
(rather than 5 days after the floating price is determinable).  That is a 
commercial call.  Just let me know how you want to handle that issue.

If mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, let me know and I will come up 
with alternative language.

Mark,

Looks good.  The product description looks fine for copying the shipping 
products that Scott Moncrieff is trading now in London.

I'm a little concerned about the line: "Each calendar month during the term 
of the Transaction will be a Determination Period"...

Is it flexible enough in changing determination periods from mid-month to 
mid-month?
As in June 15 to July 14 to represent a month?  Or will that just be another 
Long Description that we would have to draft for another product type?

Also, what if we wanted to break up the determination periods into smaller 
increments than one month?  
Let us say a 1-week or 2-week period instead of a full month.

May be something like:
"Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a 
Determination Period unless otherwise specified by the Effective Dates"

That's my two cents,
Homer

Peter -

We have thought about this from time to time.  Our primary concern has not 
been the strict adherence to the contractual notice requirements (because of 
the lack of substantive concern you mention) but the fear of possible waiver 
of rights that might take place if the requests are not consistent or handled 
carefully.  These are all issues that apply to trading margin calls 
generally.  Most recently Carol St. Clair, who Mark H. has asked to be the 
point lawyer for Credit and credit issues, has been working on this problem.

		 Subject: Margin Calls - Financial

Mark, I recently was dealing with Russell in Credit on a margin call letter 
for IMC Canada and it seemed to me that the letter in substance met Credit's 
requirements but did not comply with the ISDA in terms of formalities (i.e. 
use of defined terms, currency specification, notice and delivery timing, 
notice addresses, etc.).  It seemed to me that the form they are using may 
have been drafted some time ago and needs to be updated so that it is not a 
drafting exercise on a case by case basis.  Practically, to the extent that 
the counterparty will not object to delivery, there really is no substantive 
concern.  However, as credit is becoming a significant issue in commodity 
markets, if the counterparty wants to object, particularly in circumstances 
where their credit is getting "tight", I can see the lack of contractual 
compliance perhaps being problematic.  Can somebody in your group develop a 
template (perhaps a few will be required) that could be used under the Enron 
form, the "industrial" form, the ISDA form and for Canada.  Please call 
Russell, Bill or me to discuss.  Peter.

Mark,

Whether or not the mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, you should 
probably ask Scott Moncrieff or Joe King to answer that question.

I was just suggesting the possibility...  I do like the additional language 
that covers deals shorter than one month

"Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a 
Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less 
than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the 
Transaction."

Perhaps we should proceed with the current Product Description and worry 
about the mid-month to mid-month description if/when we need it.

I haven't heard anything from anyone but you and the EnronOnline team.  I 
suggest we go forward as you suggested in your June 4 e-mail and deal with 
the mid-month to mid-month issue if it ever actually arises.

Mark,

Did you ever get a final answer on the Product Description?

Mark,

Whether or not the mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, you should 
probably ask Scott Moncrieff or Joe King to answer that question.

I was just suggesting the possibility...  I do like the additional language 
that covers deals shorter than one month

"Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a 
Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less 
than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the 
Transaction."

Perhaps we should proceed with the current Product Description and worry 
about the mid-month to mid-month description if/when we need it.

Subject: Re: Tanker Freight Long Description  

Homer - 

The problem with the language you suggest is that it will be triggered by any 
term that is longer than a month.  As far as I know, we have never had a 
product that went from mid-month to mid-month.  Is that a real issue for us 
here?  We have language in a few products already that takes care of the 
second issue (deals shorter than one month):

Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a 
Determination Period; provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less 
than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the 
Transaction.

In some cases (e.g. power swaps), when the deal is for less than a month the 
payment dates are modified to fall at the beginning of the following month 
(rather than 5 days after the floating price is determinable).  That is a 
commercial call.  Just let me know how you want to handle that issue.

If mid-month to mid-month deals are likely, let me know and I will come up 
with alternative language.

Mark

Mark,

Looks good.  The product description looks fine for copying the shipping 
products that Scott Moncrieff is trading now in London.

I'm a little concerned about the line: "Each calendar month during the term 
of the Transaction will be a Determination Period"...

Is it flexible enough in changing determination periods from mid-month to 
mid-month?
As in June 15 to July 14 to represent a month?  Or will that just be another 
Long Description that we would have to draft for another product type?

Also, what if we wanted to break up the determination periods into smaller 
increments than one month?  
Let us say a 1-week or 2-week period instead of a full month.

May be something like:
"Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a 
Determination Period unless otherwise specified by the Effective Dates"

That's my two cents,
Homer

REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES


June 7, 2001
Notice No. 01-191

TO:
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS

FROM:
NEAL WOLKOFF, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT

RE:
EXCHANGE TO SUBSTITUTE POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION 
LIMIT RULES

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has 
approved substituting position accountability requirements for the current 
position limits on all but the last three trading days of its crude oil, 
heating oil, unleaded gasoline, and natural gas contracts, beginning with the 
Friday, June 15, trading session.

For the last three days of trading in a particular delivery month, each of 
those contracts would continue to have a position limit of 1,000 lots.

The current net position limits levels will be reflected in the 
accountability levels. These are:

   Any one month         All months
Crude oil  10,000   20,000
Unleaded gasoline 5,000   7,000
Heating oil  5,000   7,000
Natural gas  7,000   12,000



Any market participant with positions exceeding these levels may be contacted 
by the Exchange with inquiries regarding the participant's hedging 
requirements or financial condition. The Exchange would reserve the right to 
require that the position be reduced or capped.

There will no longer be any gross limits on the number of positions that can 
be held, as long as they are offset by positions on the opposite side of the 
market (example: a participant with 10,000 long positions in September, 
October, and November crude oil futures and 10,000 short positions for 
December and January would be considered to have a net position of 10,000 
contracts).

These new rules are also intended to apply to the Brent crude oil futures 
contract, planned for launch this summer. The board has also approved a 
minimum reporting level of 100 lots for that contract.

These rules, which closely resemble those in place for metals traded on the 
COMEX Division, must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
prior to implementation.

Subject: Performance Feedback

Mark,

I just wanted to drop you a quick note on the feedback process. I declined 
Carol's feedback form, but that in no way is intended as a reflection on her 
performance.  I just have not worked with her enough yet to feel that I can 
contribute meaningful feedback. The few issues that I have worked with her on 
have given me a very favorable impression of her abilities. I certainly 
expect  to work more with her in the future.  Also, I will get Sara's and 
Susan Flynn's done, just not today. I will be in the office tomorrow, and 
should complete them then. I received a dozen feedback requests this period, 
and it is just taking me awhile to get them all done. I would prefer they be 
a day late, but meaningful. Sorry for the delay.

Thanks,
Tanya

It turns out that quite a bit has been happening without us so we may be 
inundated with information over the next day or so.  Let me know if the 
message below does not come through in color since it will be difficult to 
decipher.

Louise is quite anxious to finalize the ETA, PA and Read-only PA and I 
explained that we were still waiting for the proposed changes from London.  
Knowing Louise I have a feeling we may see that stuff soon.

Since we seem to be a bit behind schedule, Louise agreed that an all-hands 
legal meeting next week might be premature and she is contacting the London 
team to discuss scheduling.  I'll let you know as soon as I have anything 
more to report on the calendar.

Subject: Registration Process Questions  

Let's be clear about all of the confusion which took place last week on how 
to register,  this is what we are doing.  Any comments or problems please 
reply.  I have tried to address everyone's points (see end of email).  

1.  Current Customers

We are going to pre-register a large number of customers prior to the 
launch.   These customers will not  receive any documentation from us apart 
from the one page application form (Password Application) and a nice glossy 
marketing brochure.

They will not be asked to fill in any form of registration documentation.  
All of the approvals should be done internally as we already trade with these 
people.

Procedure
1.  A list of customers to be pre-registered is compiled.
2.  Sign off on the list is obtained from Tax, Credit, Legal etc.
3. The customer receives from Enron a Password Application Form (postal) and 
a marketing brochure (this will be very glossy with only high level details 
nothing specific to the customer but will outline the registration process 
(to include whether to send to UK os  US office).  The PA will be specific to 
each country and therefore we should be able to send out the specific PA to 
each counterparty.
4. The customer signs the document (Password Application) and returns to 
Enron. 
5. Enron dispatches the System Administrator password and login.
6.  The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as 
loaded for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the 
country of origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the 
customer will scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice 
of either "I accept" or "I do not accept" (with no default on enter).  This 
ETA must be printable.
7.   The customer then enters the site and transacts.  If the customer is 
transacting under a master then the GTC for a particular product will not 
need to be accepted, if the customer is dealing without a master then any 
person using the administrator password or any of its subsidiary passwords 
can accept the GTC (it only needs to be accepted once by any one person under 
this SA password).  The system will need to be loaded with the information as 
to whether a counterparty requires GTC or not for each commodity/product type.

Elena's questions
Q:  Will PA be available as well as ETA for viewing and printing in the 
"House"?  No only in the garden.  PA and ETA for all jurisdictions will be 
available and printable in the garden (drop down box would be my suggestion).

2.  New Customers

There are two alternative routes possible.

Procedure 1: Off Line Registration

Potential Customer will e-mail, phone to express their willingness to trade 
online, i.e. get the ID and Password
Enron will mail Registration Pack to the Potential Customer with PA for 
appropriate jurisdiction.
Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the 
system administrator login and password.
The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded 
for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of 
origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will 
scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either "I 
accept" or "I do not accept" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be 
printable.
The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting 
GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or 
any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be 
accepted once by any one person under this SA password).  


Procedure Two:  Partial OnLine Registration
Registration Pack including PAs for all jurisdictions will be available in 
the Garden
Customer has to chose (drop down box) which jurisdiction he is in,  print out 
appropriate Registration Form and PA,  fill in Registration Form, sign PA and 
mail it to Enron
Customer will fill in Registration Form, sign PA and mail it back to Enron
If the customer is approved for Online Trading by Enron, it will receive the 
system administrator login and password.
The customer logs in and the immediately is greeted with the ETA (as loaded 
for the specific counterparty profile which will be based on the country of 
origin of the customer).  The ETA must be printable and the customer will 
scroll through the document to the end where he has the choice of either "I 
accept" or "I do not accept" (with no default on enter).  This ETA must be 
printable.
The customer then enters the site and transacts.The customer is transacting 
GTCs for all  products and   any person using the administrator password or 
any of its subsidiary passwords can accept the GTC (it only needs to be 
accepted once by any one person under this SA password).  

The Registration Form is currently in draft form and I attach below but 
clearly Janine may want to add more on her side.

Elena's questions
Q:  1) Alternative 1 or 2? Both
 2) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential customers that there request for access may not be granted.  YES - 
In the  garden there must be a phrase that any access may not be granted and 
that it is solely on our discretion (this is not just for Read Only its for 
all applications)
 3) Should all ETAs and PAs be available and printable in the Garden? CC 
prefers them to be available...YES

3.  Read Only Customers

If a customer / counterparty does not respond by signing our PA and therefore 
has not access to the site and we are very keen for them to be a trading 
counterparty over the Internet we want a way of showing them what they are 
missing.  So we will be sending them a password and login for read only 
access.  We could also send out to bodies like regulators or brokers etc but 
that will be up to the traders - any counterparties wanting access like this 
would apply through th eroute outlined above for new counterparties and we 
would authorise readonly access.  We will no be advertising read only access 
as available.

They will be able to enter the site for a period for time (Enron needs to be 
capable of setting system limits to the amount of time a 
customer/counterparty is given read-only access for) unable to transact but 
view only.  

Procedure
1.  Either, Enron monitors the list of counterparties having registered 
against the full counterparty list and notes that specific counterparty has 
not registered.  The trading desk with primary trading contact with such 
counterparty is contacted and asked if they would like to offer read only 
access for a period of time.
or,   a trader applies to the Online Product Control group for read only 
access for one of his customers.
2.  The Product Control Group will issue a password/login which will be time 
dated (only valid for a certain period).
3. The counterparty will login and immediately greeted by a Read Only ETA  - 
these are to be country specific.  
4. The counterparty must accept the Read Only ETA online before entering the 
site where he has been given READ ONLY access.  
5.   Under this scenario there is only one password and no capability of 
creating any further passwords (not like a system administrator password).
6. When the password expires they will need a prompt box indicating how they 
should register to continue seeing prices.

Elena's issues
1) Should Read Only ETA be printable and where? YES - should be printable 
when it appears on screen at login (no need for it to be in the garden)
2) What limitations will be imposed on the Guest User, i.e. one log in 
session, limited time etc. - This decision has to be made in order for CC to 
put an appropriate language into the Read Only ETA. Read Only ETAs for all 
jurisdictions have to be finalised by July 7th. Needs to be flexible although 
one password has no capability of creating further passwords, but the period 
of time they are allowed access will depend on each trader.  Some customers 
may be allowed in for one day others for one month.
3) In the Garden there must be a sentence (to be drafted by CC) to inform 
potential Guest User that his request for Read Only access may not be 
granted. We will not be advertising this facility and it will therefore not 
be mentioned in the garden.  The only phrase in the garden refers to 
customers who apply for a password may not get access (see above).
4) Is Read Only ETA accepted online or it should be signed and mailed back to 
Enron as a hard copy? The latest agreed was that it will be signed off line, 
but accepting it online should work as well, and seems to be a cleaner 
way...No this will be signed/clicked online just like the ETAs.

Mark's comments
System administrator will not be a trader as far as the system is concerned. 
If they are in reality that is none of our concern.  Agreed - we need to 
change the name of System Administrator to Trader Administrator
ETA acceptance process - we have legal confirmation of your comment? I would 
expect that all users that trade on the system should read and accept it 
(which I think is where Bob is coming from). Only one person per System 
Administration Password / Trader Adminstrator password accepts the ETA.

Guest only users
This concept was raised to us for the first time yesterday - and I have some 
process queries on it. See above.
How do we separate/ identify the applications? See above.
What will be the process for upgrading users f they successfully apply for 
full rights?  They need to receive a notice when their password expires which 
prompts them to follow the application process.

2 other queries  -
Why do they need an ETA when they will not be allowed to trade 
electronically? Need a Read Only ETA - see document for further understanding
Limitations to be imposed - where is this being coded and who by? There will 
be a timetable impact. This is not new and therefore isn't

Bob's comments

1. Existing Enron Customers (approx 2,000)
The first person from the customer's company logging Online has to accept 
ETA. After that ETA has to be available for viewing and printing for all 
other users.
The first person logging on will always be the Administrator (to set up his 
users) so how can a probable non-trading user accept ETAs for his traders?  
Probably will be a trader - change the password to TRADER ADMINISTRATOR 
PASSWORD/ MASTER TRADING PASSWORD

3. Unknown Customers (currently not trading with Enron) willing to get 
Trading Access
Alternative 1 most closely mirrors what we're doing for our existing customer 
base and so the procedures will already be in place for EOL Product Control / 
System Admin to run this. If the marketing pack mailing method is utilised we 
cut down on extra effort in a number of areas (marketing pack will be signed 
off by legal, business processes already there, no extra development effort, 
single point of reference).
The marketing pack is a glossy brochure advertising our site within it there 
will be the registration form, I think we do both alternatives.

Tim's comments

 The process you have described is as I understood things, except
that for Guest Users ( also referred to as Read Only Users - Regulators,
Lawyers, Brokers, Potential Traders etc).  As we discussed on Wednesday and
as Andrew mentioned yesterday, I understood the process to be as follows:

 The Guest will phone or sent e-mail (possibly fill in a form online,
that will be automatically e-mailed) to Enron System Administrator.
Customers will provide info on their name, e-mail address, mailing address,
country of incorporation  etc.   If Enron approves the customer as a Guest
user, the System Administrator will  e-mail/fax to the Guest the Read Only
ETA.  The Guest will execute the Read only ETA in hard copy and return it to
Enron (by fax or post).  Enron will then issue a Guest ID and Password.  The
Read Only ETA will be available on the website as a reminder to the Guest.
This will not be in hard copy it will be online, see above we are not going 
to advertise this read only capability.

OK?

From the NYT article:

The business that Thomas D. Gros is building for Enron remains untested.
 But his entire career seems to have been aimed at the opportunity. 

 He studied aerospace engineering, worked as an analyst for the Central
 Intelligence Agency, earned an M.B.A. and set up a natural-gas trading
 operation -- competing against Enron -- for British Petroleum. He also did a
 stint on Wall Street with Chemical Bank. ---------------------- Forwarded by Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT on

Subject: RE: GTCs

Mark, here is a summary of the telephone conversation I had with Clifford 
Chance earlier today - I outlined to you the issue which was raised earlier 
today on the telephone.  Perhaps you could apprise Louise of the situation, 
and find out for definite (if possible!) what will in practice occur with the 
trading system (viz. viewing the long descriptions).

If we need to cross refer to the GTC in the short description, my thought is 
that option 4. below would be the simplest solution based on what we've done 
to date.  I would be interested to hear your thoughts on the matter.

Regards, Edmund.

Subject: RE: GTCs



Edmund

Many thanks for this. I agree that it is very important to ensure that the
product descriptions, both long and short, are incorporated into the
contract and that this incorporation is very clear. The ETA states that if
there is no master agreement in existence between the parties the GTCs on
the website will apply. It must be clear from the website which terms these
are.

As we discussed on the telephone, there are a number of ways in which we can
deal with this:

1. the GTCs could state that the long and short form descriptions apply
when trading on the particular GTCs - it would be necessary to list the
products in the GTCs to which those GTCs apply. However, I am not sure how a
counterparty makes the connection between the short form description and the
GTC (possibly by accepting the GTCs when entering the website on the first
occasion).  In any event, if you add a new product later which will be
traded on those particular GTCs it will be necessary for the counterparty to
accept those GTCs again;

2. a new column to be inserted on the trading screen which shows which
GTCs apply - I assume this is unacceptable from an aesthetics point of view;

3. a reference to the GTCs to apply and the long descriptions to be
incorporated in the short form descriptions - I assume that when a
counterparty clicks on a price to bid, this reference would appear in the
bid box with the short form description ;

4. a reference in the short form descriptions to the GTCs being as
stated in the long form descriptions and that both are incorporated - this
is on the assumption that by clicking on a price to bid, this reference
would appear in the bid box with the short form description.

It is very difficult to advise properly as to which of these methods is the
most appropriate without seeing the design of the website. The essence of
incorporation is whether it is clear to the user that the terms have been
incorporated. That said, I assume that 2 and 3 will be unacceptable. With
this in mind,  you may prefer option 4. However, I would want to see the
design of the layout of the website before confirming this advice.

Please let me know if you have any queries concerning this.

Kind regards.

Andrew

My mistake in raising the issue - Peter Sceats is with the broker in London 
who arranged the trade.Here are the most recent versions from Clifford Chance.  They were sent to 
Sullivan & Cromwell yesterday to be "Americanized" and are still drafts with 
a number of open issues yet to be resolved - so we can easily make changes as 
necessary to solve issues you may raise.

The PA = Password Application - to be signed by counterparty & sent to us 
before a password is issued.
The ETA = Electronic Trading Agreement - to be agreed to online before 
trading is permitted.
The ROETA = Read Only ETA - to be agreed to online by persons wishing access 
to the site to view but not trade (probably misnamed - should be ROPA or 
something that doesn't sound like they'll be able to trade).

This is the e-mail I mentioned yesterday.  It is not exactly what had been 
described to me and I do have concerns with it.  My preference would be to 
limit the clause to the providing of letters of credit whenever we ask (as 
opposed to any security in form and from a provider satisfactory to us).  I 
understand that London legal was doing some tinkering with the language but I 
haven't seen anything from them yet.  Let's discuss.

Subject: Credit Clause - online trading GTC's

Mark,

Following the Online Trading conference call, here is the first stab at the  
Credit Clause to include in the GTC's for less credit worthy counterparties :-

"If, for any reason [ Enron ] determines it is necessary to obtain security [ 
Enron ] may in its sole discretion and within one business day upon notice to 
[ Counterparty ], require [ Counterparty ] to provide [ Enron ] with 
satisfactory security, in a format and from a provider acceptable to [ Enron 
].

Without prejudice to any legal remedies available to [Enron] and without 
[Enron] incurring any other costs, losses or damages (whether to 
[Counterparty] or to third parties) arising from any delay or other, [Enron]  
may withhold or cease delivery (whether or not delivery has commenced) until 
[Enron ] receives prepayment, or  cash collateral or an acceptable letter of 
credit or guaranty, as the case may be. All bank charges and other fees, 
commissions, costs and expenses incurred with respect to furnishing security 
to [Enron] shall be for the account of [Counterparty]."


The second paragraph provides a remedy for contracts involving  physical 
deliveries, but  requires some re-working to provide Enron the right to 
terminate specific contracts with a counterparty for trades which are purely 
financial contracts, if the Counterparty failed to provide adequate security 
in suggested time frame.   
Please call if you have any questions.

Regards

David
I will be handling the derivatives side of the ETOL transaction this time so 
future communications should probably come to me directly.  I will be 
reviewing the ISDA draft this weekend and it would be helpful if I could get 
some sort of description of the overall transaction.  Is there a term sheet 
or executive summary of the deal?  If so, my fax # is (713)646-3490.  Thanks for your note.  Yes, I am available for the call and have asked 
Sullivan & Cromwell to have someone available as well.  As soon as the time 
is firm, I will be able to let you know who at S&C to call.

I've gone back through the ISDA Credit Support Annex and the "green book" and 
my conclusion is that unless we modify the standard form, we have to give an 
Independent Amount back to the counterparty when we go out of the money far 
enough (note that the definition of Exposure results in a negative number 
when we are out of the money reducing the Credit Support Amount below the 
Independent Amount).  The theory there is that as the market moves against 
us, we are cushioned by our "out-of-the-moneyness" and will be able to ask 
for support as the market moves back in our favor before we are actually in 
the money.  I'm afraid that Credit has been operating under the assumption 
that we get to keep Independent Amounts until the Transaction terminates.  We 
need to set up a system with Credit so we all know what is meant on the 
credit work sheets -- i.e. whether a cushion or up-front amount should be 
given back to the counterparty as we go out of the money or not (maybe the 
paralegals can suggest something?).  I suggest we add the following language 
(taken from the green book) when we are using Paragraph 13 and Credit tells 
us they don't want to have to give the cushion amount back, no matter how far 
we go out of the money:

 "Credit Support Amount" will mean the higher of (i) the amount calculated as 
provided in the definition of that
  term in Paragraph 3(b) and (ii) the sum of the Pledgor's Independent 
Amounts.

I will modify the Force Energy document to include it and, unless you would 
like to suggest alternative language, ask Tana to add it to our list of 
alternatives for Paragraph 13.---------------------- Forwarded by Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT on

My apologies for the late notice in requesting your performance review for 
David Portz.  He was incorrectly listed in the system as an employee under my

Subject: ETOL SWAP


Mark,

further to our recent conversation, I attach the senior debt intercreditor 
agreement which ECTRL and all the other parties will be required to resign as 
part of the sub-debt / equity deal.



However the resigning is necessary purely in ECTRC's capacity as party to the 
Financial Hedge Swap (a contract which ECTRC signed at new year 1998), and is 
nothing to do with the current draft currency swap. 

Concerning your comments on swap itsself, the ability of the Delaware Trust 
to perform under the swap is purely a function of Enron (in this case ETOL) 
performing its obligations under the subdebt agreement. Milbanks (acting for 
the investors and the draftsmen of the swap docs) have no doubt provided that 
whilst ECTRL need only pay $ when it receives o, ECTRL may not terminate the 
swap or cash out if the Delaware Trust does not perform because ETOL has not 
performed. This is probably the optionality to which you referred when we 
spoke.

Robina is aware of this. She is awaiting pricing from Harry. Both you and 
Harry should feel free to contact Robina (on 171 316 7438) to discuss any 
terms of the swap which are not clear to you. (I am now on holiday until 2nd 
August).

In case you don't already have it, I also attach the deal structure chart 
which may be of some assistance.



Our timetable is to CLOSE on August 12th. We would like to have all docs in 
agreed form by the end of July.

Thanks for your help.


       Mark


  
PS: Paul Coleman is from Slaughter and May and is representing Enron on the 
deal.





Dan,

Thanks for the drafts.  I believe our only comment comes from our 
confirmation desk that the Commodity Reference Price in Enron3.doc should be 
"OIL - WTI - NYMEX".  Give me a call (713-853-7459) if you have any questions.

Jung / Mark,

I've attached amended trade confirmations in connection with the June 29/99
swaps, black-lined to show Enron's requested changes.  Please note that
moving one of the swaps under the TD Bank ISDA agreement will require a new
guarantee from Enron Corp. (I imagine you'll simply duplicate the guarantee
provided for the TD Texas swap?) - can you please forward same to Anne
Scully in Houston.

Please give me a call at (416) 983-9473 once you've had a chance to review
the attached.

Thanks,
Dan

One day a cat dies of natural causes and goes to Heaven. There he meets the 
Lord himself. The Lord says
to the cat, "You lived a good life and if there is anyway I can make your 
stay in Heaven more comfortable,
please let Me know."

The cat thinks for a moment and says, "Lord, all my life I have lived with a 
poor family and had to sleep
on a hard wooden floor."

The Lord stops the cat and says, "Say no more," and a wonderful fluffy 
pillow  appears.

A few days later six mice are killed in a tragic farming accident and go to 
Heaven. Again the Lord is
there to greet them with the same offer.  The mice answer, "All of our lives 
we have been chased. We have
had to run from cats, dogs, and even women with brooms.  Running, running,  
running;  we're tired of running. Do
you think we could have roller skates so we don't have to run anymore?"

The Lord says, "Say no more," and fits each mouse with beautiful new roller 
skates.

About a week later the Lord stops by to see the cat and finds him in a deep 
sleep on the pillow. The Lord
gently wakes the cat and asks him how was he doing. The cat replies better 
than I could have ever expected.
And those Meals on Wheels you've been sending by are theeeeeeee best!!!"

I think this is the most recent version of the ETA.  Obviously, this is the 
UK version and Sullivan & Cromwell are turning it into a US document.  The US 
version will be governed by NY law and contain an arbitration clause.  We're 
also trying to figure out how much to say about the confirmation process 
since it may vary from product to product and will almost certainly be 
different from the UK version.  Speaking of which, I was surprised to find 
that they have the telephone conversation (and in this case the web site 
records) control over a confirmation which has been signed by both parties.  
What's the practice in your part of the world?  One alternative is to insert 
the language (or something like it) that we use in financial trading which 
says that we will send a written confirm, gives the counterparty a short time 
(2 or 3 days) to respond and indicates that silence will be deemed 
acceptance.  Would that work for your deals?

Anyway, I'm in NY today and tomorrow, back in the office on Wed.  Louise is 
insistent that the GTC's be available to be uploaded this weekend.  I'll be 
calling in periodically tomorrow and will try to get you since I'm sure you 
will have issues to discuss - and now is the right time to get changes made 
to the ETA if necessary.

Dear Mark

Further to my various emails on Friday 16 July 1999, please find attached a
copy of the UK ETA which shows the amendments from the drafts I sent to you
on Friday.  All of these changes have been inserted into all Electronic
Trading Agreements for each of the primary jurisdictions.  These changes
have been made following my conference call with Scott Sefton, Justin Boyd,
Louise Kitchen and others yesterday afternoon.

I also attach a revised draft of the UK Gas Physical Beach GTC and the

sent to you last Friday.

I would be grateful for any comments on these documents as well as those
sent to you on Friday.

Subject: Wonderful Theories


The grand prize is just crazy enough to work...


A contest was held for people to submit their theories on ANY subject.
Below are the winners:

4th RUNNER-UP (Subject:  Probability Theory).   If an infinite number of
rednecks riding in an infinite number of pickup trucks fire an infinite
number of shotgun rounds at an infinite number of highway signs, they
will eventually produce all the world's great literary works in Braille.

3rd RUNNER-UP (Subject:  Bio-Mechanics).  Why Yawning Is Contagious: You
yawn to equalize the pressure on your eardrums. This pressure change
outside your eardrums unbalances other people's ear pressures, so they
then yawn to even it out.

2nd RUNNER-UP (Subject:  Symbolic Logic).  Communist China Is
Technologically underdeveloped because they have no alphabet and
therefore cannot use acronyms to communicate technical ideas at a faster
rate.

1st RUNNER-UP (Subject:  Newtonian Mechanics).  The earth may spin
faster on its axis due to deforestation. Just as a figure skater's rate
of spin increases when the arms are brought in close to the body, the
cutting of tall trees may cause our planet to spin dangerously fast.

HONORABLE MENTION (Subject:  Linguistics).  The quantity of consonants
in the English language is constant. If omitted in one place, they turn
up in another.  When a Bostonian "pahks his cah," the lost R's migrate
southwest, causing a Texan to "warsh" his car and invest in "erl" wells.

GRAND PRIZE WINNER (Subject:  Perpetual Motion).  When a cat is dropped,
it always lands on its feet, and when toast is dropped, it always lands
buttered side down.  It was proposed to strap giant slabs of hot
buttered toast to the backs of a hundred tethered cats; the two opposing
forces will cause the cats to hover, spinning inches above the ground.
Using the giant buttered toast/cat array, a high-speed monorail could
easily link New York with Chicago.

Attached are revised drafts of the New York PA and ETA, which have been 
revised to reflect the latest Clifford Chance drafts and our discussion 
yesterday.  We are unable to blackline these drafts, due to the fact that the 
Clifford Chance drafts are not on our system (and we did not receive all of 
them in any event).  Also, we have not yet received from Mark's office the 
language on confirmations; we have taken a shot at it but can obviously 
modify it after we get the language.

Finally, we have attached a blackline of the "Legal and Privacy" statement, 
reflecting some suggested changes.  We also note that, if this document is to 
be "global", we will either need to decide on a single governing law or 
delete choice of law entirely.

Best regards.

Mark,

Following the message below, please be informed that I plan to come over to 
Houston 15 January next year and stay for 6-7 weeks (at Murphy's Montecito 
apartments).  Maybe we could change a few words on this before Christmas.  
Also, do you know to whom I may turn in order to settle the practicalities 
(invitation letter to show immigration authorities, insurance, car, etc.)?!

As discussed the table to be completed by August 4th in order for us to start 
loading the customer profiles into the system.

The following worksheet is split into two tabs for the counterparty groups 
suggested by the North America commercial versus those counterparties 
suggested by Europe commercial.  The US tab consists of the following 
information:  

Column A Fed Tax ID (needed for physical global products counterparties)
Column B Country where Headquarters is located
Column C State of Incorporation
Column D Country of Incorporation
Column E Counterparty Name
Column F Dunnes Link ID
Columns G-CU Product Types/Enron Legal Entity

The Europe Tab is set as follows:

Column A Country of Incorporation
Column B Counterparty Name
Column C Dunnes Link ID
Columns D-CR Product Types/Enron Legal Entity 



The matrix is blank assuming that all counterparties can trade all product 
types/Enron Legal Entity.  The above  responsibility groups will need to 
perform a detailed review by placing a "X" in the intersection of the 
counterparty/product types indicating that that Product Type should not be 
offered to that counterparty.

This review needs to be completed by no later than cob August 4, 1999 so that 
we can remain on our overall click trading schedule.

Digital Frontiers 
 Calif. Says Digitally Signed Broker Contracts Are Valid
 By ROSS SNEL
   
 08/03/1999 
 American Banker 
 Page 12 
 Copyright (c) 1999 American Banker, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

 A new California law opens the door for brokerages to conduct most, if not 
all, of their business in
 cyberspace.

 The legislation, which applies only to broker-dealers, validates brokerage 
contracts that are digitally
 signed.

 Though Internet brokerages routinely accept trading orders on-line, most 
require customers to enroll
 and order account transfers by sending in paper documents. The law makes 
such paperwork no
 longer necessary.

 Digital signatures-a derivative of data encryption technology that binds 
customer identities to
 documents-are seen as a way to "legalize" on-line exchanges of information.

 The California legislation, which California Governor Gray Davis signed into 
law last week, "gives
 people some certainty that these contracts are enforceable," said Thomas J. 
Smedinghoff, a partner in
 the Chicago law firm McBride Baker & Coles and a leading authority on 
digital signatures.

 He added, however, that the law's specific definition of a digital signature 
could limit the flexibility of
 its application as the technology evolves.

 Certainty about the validity of digital credentials is especially important 
to securities brokers, because
 securities transactions are typically much bigger than merchandise 
transactions on the Internet, said
 Christopher Musto, a senior analyst at Gomez Advisors Inc. in Concord, Mass.

 E-Trade Group Inc., the Menlo Park, Calif. on-line broker, pushed for the 
California bill, bringing the
 issue to the attention of state Sen. John Vasconcellos, a Democrat from San 
Jose. Sen. Vasconcellos
 introduced the proposal in February, and it passed the Senate July 15.

 San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp., the leading Internet brokerage, 
also offered input on
 the law's definition of a digital signature, according to Sen. Vasconcellos' 
chief of staff, Rand Martin.

 Schwab has focused its legislative efforts more on the federal level, 
however, a spokesman for the
 company said. "This action is a step in the right direction," the spokesman 
said. "But the real objective
 would be to get national legislation that creates uniformity regarding the 
use of digital signatures."

 E-Trade said in a news release that the new law would apply to its 
transactions with customers in all
 50 states, but the Schwab spokesman said its applicability beyond California 
is "murky."

 E-Trade did not respond to calls seeking elaboration on how it sees the law 
applying across the
 country.

 Mr. Smedinghoff, chairman of the American Bar Association's electronic 
commerce division, said the
 only way the law would have broader applicability is if a broker stipulated 
that a contract was
 governed by the laws of California.

 Legislation on digital signatures varies from state to state. For example, 
Connecticut law covers only
 medical records at hospitals, while Illinois makes electronic signatures 
applicable to all
 communications.

 In 1995 California became one of the early adopters of digital signature 
legislation, but that legislation
 was limited to communication with government agencies.

 Utah is often cited as the country's digital signature pacesetter, with a 
comprehensive law that
 preceded California's in 1995 and resulted in the pioneering designation of 
Digital Signature Trust
 Co., a Zions Bancorp. subsidiary, as a licensed certificate authority.

 To bring consistency at the federal level, Sen. Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.) 
this year introduced two
 bills addressing the issue. The Millennium Digital Commerce Act sets out to 
clarify the legal status of
 electronic signatures in general, while the Electronic Securities 
Transaction Act focuses on the
 securities industry.

Subject: Global Band Width




Just curious, which legal group will support global bandwith trading?


I'm looking forward to seeing you Friday night.  I'll bring along some 
sailing info. but thought I'd let you know now what we've got in mind.  Dan & 
Jamie are lined up so if you guys are still interested there would be 6 of 
us.  We have gotten a quote for a relatively new 46' sailboat in the British 
Virgin Islands for the week of Thanksgiving.  We'd fly down there on Saturday 
the 20th, pick up the boat the next day and return either Saturday the 27th 
or Sunday the 28th.  [The return date is still under discussion - so far we 
have (i) Jamie who wants to fly Saturday so we have a day at home before 
going back to work, (ii) Mark who likes to spend as much time on the boat as 
possible so wants to come back Sun., and (iii) Ted who when he heard the 
question said "Let's start back Saturday and spend the night in South 
Beach!"]  The charter company is the Moorings (their website is 
www.moorings.com) and the specific boat we reserved is called a Moorings 
463.  You can see a floor plan and photos on the web but the boat has three 
separate double cabins each of which has its own bathroom.

Each day's schedule is usually pretty flexible - get up whenever (I seem to 
remember Jamie getting up pretty early & making coffee), have breakfast on 
the boat, decide where to go and sail off to the next island we've picked 
out, maybe stopping at one or two interesting looking spots on the way, maybe 
not.  Maybe stopping for lunch somewhere, maybe making sandwiches while we 
sail and maybe waiting for lunch til we stop for the day.  Most days we only 
actually sail for a few hours and are anchored in a little bay by 2 or 3:00 
and spend the afternoon swimming (Ted's favorite), snorkeling (the masks, 
etc. come with the boat), hiking on shore, exploring the coastline in the 
dinghy or sitting around on the boat or beach reading, chatting, napping or 
whatever (my favorite).  There's a CD player and we listen to a variety of 
music - luckily Ted has so far been able to restrain his heavy metal 
proclivity for the duration of the trip.  If you scuba dive there are dive 
companies that will come meet the boat and take you on a dive trip - there is 
at least one really good wreck dive (in 70 - 90') in the BVI.  If you want to 
learn to dive, you can take the classroom and swimming pool instruction in 
NYC and do your certification dives in the BVI (Dan & Jamie might be diving, 
Ted & I probably won't).  Sunsets are often spectacular and signal cocktail 
hour for me.  There's usually at least one restaurant on shore in most of 
these anchorages where we go for dinner but the charter company stocks the 
boat with food (there's a fridge, stove & bbq grill on the boat) and as you 
might guess Dan and Jamie are pretty good cooks so we can always eat on board 
if we don' feel like going ashore.  While no one is excluded from any 
activities and everyone can participate in planning the itinerary, we don't 
always do everything together, either.  Everybody usually pitches in and 
shares what work (cooking, cleaning up, sailing stuff) there is, although if 
only from our keen sense of self-preservation you and Ted probably wouldn't 
be expected to cook.  In the past Jamie has been the only smoker and he has 
invariably confined his habit to the downwind portion of the deck.

As for $,  the boat, provisioning (food on board for breakfast lunch and a 
few dinners), taxes, airport transfers and a hotel room for the first night 
we get there all comes to about $760 per person.  Extras include drinks (only 
fair since you and Jamie won't be imbibing as much as the rest of us) and any 
dinners ashore and of course the dreaded airfare.  I've tentatively got  
flights for you (through the boat company) that come to $544 per person, 
though if we decide to come back on Saturday that might go down.  Ted & I 
usually try to see if there is some way to use frequent flyer miles but we're 
not always successful.  It's such a popular week to sail we need to decide 
pretty soon so we can put a deposit down - the boat is not actually reserved 
until we do.

I'd better stop & send this - it's turned out to be a good bit longer than I 
intended but I get carried away sometimes when I daydream about sailing!  
Check out the website & let me know if you have any questions.Sorry about all these - it looks like people who don't know my address are 
just guessing and they get you instead.  I'd appreciate it if you could 
forward them on to me when they come to you - I'll let the sendersknow the 
correct address as I get them and hopefully that should cut down the number 
going forward.

Let's add this as an agenda item to discuss when Sara and I are there.'Twas The Night Before Christmas
as written by a lawyer

'Twas the nocturnal segment of the diurnal period preceding the annual 
Yuletide celebration, and throughout our place of residence, kinetic activity 
was not in evidence among the possessors of this potential (party of the 
first part), including that species of domestic rodent known as Mus 
musculus.  Hosiery was meticulously suspended from the forward edge of the 
wood burning caloric apparatus, pursuant to our anticipatory pleasure 
regarding an imminent visitation from an eccentric philanthropist among whose 
folkloric appellations is the honorific title of St. Nicholas (party of the 
second part).

The prepubescent siblings, comfortably ensconced in their respective 
accommodations of repose, were experiencing subconscious visual 
hallucinations of variegated fruit confections moving rhythmically through 
their cerebrums.  My conjugal partner and I, attired in our nocturnal head 
coverings, were about to take slumberous advantage of the hibernal darkness 
when upon the avenaceous exterior portion of the grounds there ascended such 
a cacophony of dissonance that I felt compelled to arise with alacrity from 
my place of repose for the purpose of ascertaining the precise source thereof.

Hastening to the casement, I forthwith opened the barriers sealing this 
fenestration, noting thereupon that the lunar brilliance without, reflected 
as it was on the surface of a recent crystalline precipitation,  might be 
said to rival that of the solar meridian itself - thus permitting my 
incredulous optical sensory organs to behold a miniature airborne runnered 
conveyance drawn by eight diminutive specimens of the genus Rangifer,  
piloted by a minuscule, aged chauffeur so ebullient and nimble  that it 
became instantly apparent to me that he was indeed our  anticipated caller. 
With his ungulate motive power traveling at what may possibly have been more 
vertiginous velocity than patriotic alar predators,  he vociferated loudly, 
expelled breath musically through contracted  labia,  and addressed each of 
the octet by his or her respective cognomen -  "Now Dasher, now Dancer..." et 
al. - guiding them to the uppermost exterior level of our abode, through 
which structure I could readily distinguish the concatenations of each of the 
32 cloven pedal extremities.

As I retracted my cranium from its erstwhile location, and was performing a 
180-degree pivot, our distinguished visitant achieved - with utmost celerity 
and via a downward leap - entry by way of the smoke passage. He was clad 
entirely in animal pelts soiled by the ebony residue from oxidations of 
carboniferous fuels which had accumulated on the walls thereof. His 
resemblance to a street vendor I attributed largely to the plethora of 
assorted playthings which he bore dorsally in a commodious cloth receptacle.

His orbs were scintillant with reflected luminosity, while his submaxillary 
dermal indentations gave every evidence of engaging amiability. The 
capillaries of his malar regions and nasal appurtenance were engorged with 
blood which suffused the subcutaneous layers, the former approximating the 
coloration of Albion's floral emblem,  the latter that of the Prunus avium, 
or sweet cherry. His amusing sub- and supralabials resembled nothing so much 
as a common loop knot, and their ambient hirsute facial adornment appeared 
like small, tabular and columnar crystals of frozen water.

Clenched firmly between his incisors was a smoking piece whose grey fumes, 
forming a tenuous ellipse about his occiput, were suggestive of a decorative 
seasonal circlet of holly.  His visage was wider than it was high, and when 
he waxed audibly mirthful, his corpulent abdominal region undulated in the 
manner of impectinated fruit syrup in a hemispherical container. He was, in 
short, neither more nor less than an obese, jocund, multigenarian gnome, the 
optical perception of whom rendered me visibly frolicsome despite every 
effort to refrain from so being. By rapidly lowering and then elevating one 
eyelid and rotating his head slightly to one side, he indicated that 
trepidation on my part was groundless. Without utterance and with dispatch, 
he commenced filling the aforementioned appended hosiery with various of the 
aforementioned articles of merchandise extracted from his aforementioned 
previously dorsally transported cloth receptacle. Upon completion of this 
task, he executed an abrupt about-face, placed a single manual digit in 
lateral juxtaposition to his olfactory organ, inclined his cranium forward in 
a gesture of leave-taking, and forthwith effected his egress by renegotiating 
(in reverse) the smoke passage. He then propelled himself in a short vector 
onto his conveyance, directed a musical expulsion of air through his 
contracted oral sphincter to the antlered quadrupeds of burden, and proceeded 
to soar aloft in a movement  hitherto observable chiefly among the 
seed-bearing portions of a common weed. But I overheard his parting 
exclamation, audible immediately prior to his vehiculation beyond the limits 
of visibility:

"Ecstatic Yuletide to the planetary constituency,
and to that self same assemblage,
my sincerest wishes for a salubriously beneficial and gratifyingly 
pleasurable period between sunset and dawn."I think this has already been sent to you.  Just wondering, though, why this 
is being lumped together in one complex transaction instead of splitting it 
into two.

<<ECTOCT2.doc>>
Maria,  Please follow this message with the attached file to Gareth.  For 
some reason I cannot get it to go to Gareth directly.

Gareth,

Attached is the current draft of the swap confirmation for the Petrobras 
transaction.  The swap has two components -- the fixed/Libor rate swap and 
the "spread" swap.  The fixed/Libor swap is composed of the amounts computed 
pursuant to clause (i) of the definition of fixed amount and clause (i) of 
the definition of floating amount.  The amounts computed pursuant to clauses 
(iv) and (v) of the definition of fixed amount and clause (ii) of the 
definition of floating amount is the spread swap.
This is going to be a very unusual and highly structured swap in many 
respects in order to tailor it to the risk sharing that exists in this 
transaction among Petrobras, the Lenders, and Enron as swap provider. Because 
the swap includes both the rate swap and the spread swap, the benefits and 
obligations under the swap will need to be allocated internally at Enron 
between EI and ECT.  Randy and Scott recommend that a memorandum be generated 
that will reflect the manner in which this allocation will be made.  
Essentially as it is explained to me, ECT will be allocated the benefits and 
obligations related to the fixed/Libor swap and EI will be allocated the 
benefits and obligations related to the spread swap.
One other feature that EI will be responsible for is the Deferral Amount 
mentioned in the confirmation.  This arises if a Reserve Deficiency occurs 
and the Reserve Indemnity is no longer in effect.  In this situation, if any 
amount is owed to ECT on the rate swap the Company will not have sufficient 
cash flow to pay the full amount due to ECT and the Lenders.  The Lenders 
will be deferring a prorata part of their interest and principal, and ECT as 
swap provider will also have to defer a prorata part of the amount due to 
it.  The amount to be deferred is called the Deferral Amount in the attached 
draft.  EI will be responsible for any Deferral Amounts that may arise.  If 
after a Deferral Amount is generated, the Company is able to recoup any of 
the Deferral Amount, the portion payable to the Swap Provider under the 
Participation Agreement would be a "Makeup Amount" and would be allocated to 
EI when received under the swap.
A great deal of additional thought and fine tuning will continue to need to 
be applied to this portion of the transaction to make sure that it 
coordinates as appropriate with the Credit Agreement, Participation Agreement 
and Transaction Documents.  Any suggestions that you or the ECT swap lawyers 
may have would be appreciated.  One thing that would be useful would be a 
"breakage clause" that would describe in as much specificity as posible how 
the breakage would be computed whenever it is necessary to adjust the 
notional amounts under the fixed/libor swap.

Subject: Pending Issues




Priority schedule for Brent and Andrea, as of Tuesday August 3rd.
Here is the order we will work on documents and issues:

1.  Preparing response to Neuquen request for additional stamp taxes (to be
sent out today)
2.  Renault gas termsheet (John reviewing final draft)
3.  Central Puerto 10 year gas termsheet (Gaby reviewing final draft with
Guillermo's comments)
4.  Gas contract for Ferrum  (John to review final draft)
5.  Refineria San Lorenzo (parties have agreed on final form, last draft to
be sent today)
6.  Quintana long term deal  (cp reviewing stamp tax letter)(cp has sent
comments on draft for our review)
7.  Quintana short term deal (cp reviewing stamp tax letter)(cp has sent
comments on draft for our review)
8.   Answer Beth Rosen's tax question on legal status of ECEASA if it doesn't

out on Wednesday)
10.  Review YPF confidentiality agreement for offtake side of prepay. 11.

12.  Review of status of EPCA in purchasing and selling natural gas (answer
for Guille)
13.  Brazil power trade (Brent to co-ordinate with Andrea Bertone)

We will try to get to all the priorities, but will not likely be able to 
complete everything today.  If anyone wants to change the order of priorities 
or add to the list please let me know so we can discuss our schedule.

We are waiting for comments on the following documents which are listed in no
particular order:
1.  Preparation of modification to Bagley addendum for delivery after payment
(Bagley reviewing proposal)
2.  Y2K mission critical plan and meetings (Brent to co-ordinate)
3.  Total MOU for Austral Basin (Waiting for executed copies to come back

5.   Minera Alumbrera power swap or power sale (waiting for further
information on proposal)
6.  VW gas termsheet  (Draft prepared that needs review, now on hold) 7.  
Bagley meeting to discuss ENARGAS issue (John to arrange for Andrea and
Guillermo to be a part of meeting)
8.  Power offer for ICI  (sent to cp for review)
9.   Seeking return of final portion of deposit on Scott Porter's and Bill 
Butler's apartments.
10. YPF on new stamp tax proposal (pending execution)

12.  Preparing drafts for possible restructuring for four Demand Marketing
customers  (sent to cp for review)
Power offer for Ferrum (final offer sent yesterday)
Preparing extension of PDA contract (on hold pending pricing)


I am also still working on another draft of the Broker Agreement format but 
it is low on my priority list at the moment.   ECT is also in the process of 
a trading contract audit which we will participate in (this will give us an 
opportunity to try and finalise our various contract forms for review in 
Houston).  Based on comments from Guillermo Canovas and EI litigation 
managers I need to review the dispute resolution provisions in all our 
contracts.



Please do a card for my rolodex.

ThanksMarcus:

When we were in New Orleans I mentioned that I might be planning a holiday in 
Germany - well, I've finally gotten around to scheduling it.  I'm flying into 
Munich on the 27th and leaving from Amsterdam September 9.  If you are going 
to be in the office next Monday or Tuesday (when I'll be in the London 
office), I'd really appreciate a few minutes of your time to get whatever 
suggestions you would like to make.  If you will be out next week, maybe we 
could chat by phone tomorrow or Friday.

Thanks!

This will need to be taken account of when preparing your opinions.

Here are the revised North American documents.  Those with "(credit)" in the 
document name contain the letter of credit language.  I suggest that you not 
consider the EGLI and ELFI documents as final until we get sign-off from 
Credit as to the "Buyer posts" language which I suspect they contain.

I like to leave for London at least a day earlier than absolutely necessary 
so I have a day to get adjusted to the time change - otherwise you get off 
the plane and go straight to the office (with a shower on the way if you're 
lucky) and I'm exhausted at that point.  I don't ever sleep well on the 
plane.  This time I'm leaving on Friday afternoon to stop in NY for a party 
Friday night and then leaving for London from there on Sat. night.  Since the 
company pays for business class, there's no savings for going over the 
weekend.  I could get a free companion ticket for T but he's never been able 
to get off work at the same time I have to go.

The rest of our August is a bit hectic, too.  Next weekend T has a swim meet 
in San Francisco and I leave that Mon. night to spend the rest of the week in 
S. America. The following weekend we had tentatively set a trip to Laguna 
Beach but I think it's been canceled for lack of funds if not just so I can 
catch my breath.  We leave on our big trip to Europe (Germany, Belgium & the 
Netherlands) on the 26th and don't get home til 9/12.

I have to pack tonight so I think we'll pass on the film.  I hope we get a 
chance to get together some time in the next few weeks - maybe a weeknight 
dinner some time since the weekends look pretty full?It strikes me that it would be appropriate to offer this service without the 
application fee and deposit to Platinum Elite members and Presidents Club 
members.  If not, the fact that ANY spaces are being removed from the already 
inadequate supply will only infuriate me, not make me happy.

As a frequent traveler in the Houston area, Continental Airlines would
like to tell you about a new guaranteed parking service at Bush
Intercontinental Airport (IAH) being introduced by the City of Houston
Aviation Department.

The IAH Sure Park is a members-only service that guarantees you a parking
space on a secure floor (2nd level) via a private entrance in the C East
Garage, along with a private expedited exit.  The C East Garage is
adjacent to Terminal C and parking will be available 24 hours a day, 365
days a year.   There is a one-time application fee of $200 along with a
$50 refundable deposit for the access card.  When you use the IAH SurePark
facility, the charge is $15 per 24 hour period.  For more information or
to obtain a membership application, please call the Houston Airport
Management office at 281-230-3006 or e-mail your request to
iahsurepark@has.ci.houston.tx.us.

IAH Sure Park is a service managed in whole by the City of Houston
Aviation Department and is offered on a first come, first served basis.


Thanks for the update - I can't say I'm too sorry about any delay since I 
haven't had a spare moment to look at them yet anyway.  This project moves so 
fast and there's so much to do it's scary!Looks good to me.  Enjoy!

1.  Finance deals for total return swaps may not have had such language.
   2.  A couple of masters may have excluded trade option exemption with 
respect to counterparty or used our "deemed" language.
   3.  Maybe some of Shari's weather masters excluded commodity items.
   4.  Credit Lyonnais AAA Master didn't address commodities.  Are there 
other AAA masters and/or bank masters like this?
   5.  The paralegals may remember something.

Hey Mark,
Nice to hear from you. Sorry we missed all those appointments. I even missed 
the happy hour with Tana and Marie. How long are you going to be in London. 
There is no chance I'll be there before the 15th. I was scheduled to be back 
in Houston  next Monday but it looks like I am spending the next week in 
Abuja, Nigeria. Let me know what your plans are for the following week. 

I don't recall any such deviations from the norm, on the business note , that 
is. The agreements were pretty much standard. You did such a great job, I 
wouldn't want to temper with perfection, would I? Miss you all. Say hi to the

Here is the North American legal issues list I prepared for Mark.  He 
actually called me down to ask for it yesterday (my first day back no less).  
Obviously I've kept it to just the major areas where there might be residual 
legal risk.  He seemed satisfied enough with the format.  I explained that I 
had mentioned his request to you and that you were working on a European 
version which might turn out to be somewhat longer since you have so many 
jurisdictions to deal with.The Online Trading IT people have sent us a revised version of the long 
descriptions and a document spelling out the "rules" for how they are put 
together.  Louise is asking for our final comments by close of business on 
next Wednesday (August 18th).  Since I will be out of town then, please 
forward your comments and/or approvals directly to Mark Dilworth.  Questions 
can be directed to Mark Dilworth, Marcello Romano or Louise Kitchen, all on 
the online trading team.

Mark, 

Attached are:

A word document detailing the 'rules' by which product long descriptions are 
structured. 
A spreadsheet containing a tab for each data attribute. 

The spreadsheet first page (LONGS) includes examples of the long descriptions 
for a product out of each product type group (Canadian Gas, NA Gas etc.) 
(these are in column V) - please note ANDY there are no definitions for Coal 
or Emissions locations. 

On each of the subsequent sheets are the long description sentences for each 
underlying data attribute that can contribute to a product (including one for 
each product type) for legal review. 

The product type long description sheet also indicates which GTCs are 
required. 

Please let me know if you have any queries - if I am not available Marcello 
is in the right time zone, and is familiar with all aspects of the procduct 
descriptions. 

regards

Mark

with the recently circulated content together with a blank password 
application all in a very exciting package of some kind?Joao - 

I'm making another business trip to Brazil - this time just to Sao Paolo.  
I'll be there Tuesday to Thursday of this week.  Any chance you will be 
nearby?  I tried to arrange a meeting in Rio too but unfortunately our office 
there is quite small and the only people I need to see will be in Sao Paolo 
then.  I also still get to London every once in a while.  Let me know when 
you are there - maybe we can have dinner.

Here are my draftversions of the weather GTC's.  Since Enron North America 
will be the Enron contracting entity for all of the transactions, I have 
expanded the documents to allow for European as well as U.S. transactions and 
to allow for multiple weather station (index) deals or single weather station 
deals.  The option forms work for either a put or call but that has to be 
specified on the web site.  I think it would make sense for one of the 
weather commercial people to take a quick look at the forms to make sure they 
agree that they work.  I'm hoping to sit down with Mark Dilworth in the 
morning to make sure the long descriptions are complete - when you look at 
these forms, it is clear that a number of defined terms have to be covered on 
the web site: Premium, Effective Date, Termination Date, Reference Weather 
Station(s), Fallback Reference Weather Station(s), Reference Basis, Reference 
Degrees (C or F), Strike Amount, Notional Amount and Maximum Payout Limit are 
the terms I have identified so far.

Please Note - these are NOT ready to be uploaded to the system!  There are 
blanks for the weather agencies for the European deals - these are not 
referenced in the earlier UK drafts and I don't know who the appropriate 
agencies are.  I have not spelled out the data sources for the European 
transactions either.

Mark


 It's not clear to me which form you want - we have (i) an "Annex A" which we 
use like a general terms and conditions to attach to a one-off confirm (i.e. 
where there is no master agreement in place) and is sometimes called the 
"Omnibus" (because it's a single form for any type of commodity derivative 
which replaced a multitude of separate forms) or (ii) a "Schedule" which is 
attached to the ISDA form agreement to make it our version of the ISDA master 
which can then have a collateral support annex attached.  Just to make it a 
little more complicated, we also have our own form of master agreement which 
we use with less sophisticated counterparties and where we need to translate 
the document into another language (which we don't want to do with the ISDA). 
 Just let me know which one you want & I'll have Tana e-mail it to you.  This 
stuff is all covered in Tana's short-course on ECT derivatives documentation 
- maybe you'd like to sit in on it when she comes over?

I flubbed in my last message. I don't want the deemed ISDA, I want the full 
form Annex A. Thanks!

Mark -  Would you be available to sit down with me Monday morning (say 
beginning at 10:30) to go over the spreadsheet?  I have quite a few comments 
on the financial transaction items that I was able to understand and several 
questions on areas I haven't yet been able to decipher.  I am particularly 
concerned about the Weather Products generally and the Floating Prices for 
all financial products (the Index tab).  If you could let me or my assistant 
know so I can work out my calendar for the day I'd appreciate it (I've 
blocked out 2 hours but it might not take that long).  Unfortunately I'm 
leaving town mid-afternoon so I have to get these wrapped up.  I'm at x37459.

Thanks!

Mark

p.s. - It might make sense to have somebody from the Confirmation Desk come 
too - what do you think?Here is the spreadsheet with my comments to date.
The letter looks fine to me  (one typo on the last page where the "O" in 
EnronOnline is not capitalized).I have suggested that Mark Dilworth, one of the guys responsible for the web 
site development, schedule some time with each of you to discuss the latest 
Long Descriptions spreadsheet.  He can walk you through exactly how it works 
for your commodities so you can make informed comments. The addition of Paris is news to me so we may have to make a few extra 
modifications I had not anticipated.  Once you get the info why don't you 
take a crack at making the necessary changes & let me know.  It may be pretty 
obvious but I think I can walk you through it on the phone if it's not.

Louise,

In case you didn't get my voicemail we have been through the GTC's.  
Everything is fine with the exception of some blanks to be filled in 
concerning some European meteorological reporting agences (equivalent of the 
UK Met Office and US NWS) and the data sources.

 US is complete and as we have deals in UK and France this should be 
finalised with Mark's paralegal tomorrow.  On roll-out we only envisage US 
and UK cities, Paris and Oslo so we're only awaiting Norway info as a matter 
of urgency.  We're working Stewart Peter to get this info and the same for 
the other European cities for when they're added over time.

Regards,

Mike.

Who knows if this is true or not, but it is bizarre.
__________________________________________________________
Subject: Darwinian Kharma, Very weird  (A true story from Associated
Press,
by Kurt Westervelt)

Stick with this.....it's worth it!  This is the strangest thing I've ever
heard.  The series of events that had to have taken place in order for
this
to happen are astounding!  At the 1994 annual awards dinner given for
Forensic Science, AAFS president Dr. Don Harper Mills astounded his
audience
with the legal complications of a bizarre death:  On March 23, 1994, the
medical examiner viewed the body of Ronald Opus and concluded that he
died
from a shotgun wound to the head.  Mr. Opus had jumped from the top of a
ten-story building intending to commit suicide.  He left a note to that
effect indicating his despondency.  As he fell past the ninth floor his
life
was interrupted by a shotgun blast passing through a window which killed
him
instantly.  Neither the shooter nor the dead man was aware that a safety
net
had been installed just below at the eighth floor level to protect some
building workers and that Ronald Opus would not have been able to
complete
his suicide the way he planned.  "Ordinarily," Dr. Mills continued, "A
person who sets out to commit suicide and ultimately succeeds even though
the mechanism might not be what he intended" is still defined as
committing
suicide.  That Mr. Opus was shot during what would apparently have been
an
unsuccessful suicide attempt because of the safety net, caused the
medical
examiner to feel that he had a homicide on his hands.  The room on the
ninth
floor where the shotgun blast emanated was occupied by an elderly man and
his wife.  They were arguing vigorously, and he was threatening her with
a
shotgun.  The man was so upset when he pulled the trigger that he
completely
missed his wife and the pellets went through the window striking Mr. Opus
as
he passed by outside.  When someone, intending to kill person "A," kills
person "B" instead; someone is still guilty of murder.  When confronted
with
a murder charge the old man and his wife were both adamant; they both
said
they thought the shotgun was unloaded.  The old man said it was his
long-standing habit to threaten his wife with the unloaded shotgun.  He
had
no intention to murder her.  Therefore, the killing of Mr. Opus appeared
to
be an accident; that is, the gun had been accidentally loaded.  The
continuing investigation turned up a witness who saw the old couple's son
loading the shotgun about six weeks prior to the fatal accident.  It
transpired that the old lady had cut off her son's financial support and
the
son, knowing the propensity of his father to use the shotgun
threateningly,
loaded the gun with the expectation that his father would shoot his
mother.
The case now reverts back to one of murder on the part of the son.  Now
comes the final twist!  Further investigation revealed that the couple's
son
was in fact, Ronald Opus.  He had become increasingly despondent over his
failed attempt to engineer his mother's murder.  This led him to jump off
the ten-story building on March 23rd, only to be killed by the shotgun
blast
passing through the ninth floor window.  The son had actually murdered
himself so the medical examiner closed the case and declared it a
suicide.I won't be able to attend the forum since I am travelling but do have a 
suggestion that would make TAP a bit more attractive.  When a traveller is 
placed on a "wait list" the agency should check back with the provider 
regularly and often to see if the wait can be cleared.  If you wait for the 
provider to get back to you, as appears to be TAP's policy, the chances are 
significantly reduced since the provider will almost invariably clear the 
person on the phone before anyone on the list.  Other agents have done this 
for me, I have done this for myself, and it works.Tana - please send a copy of the Stikeman memo to Peter Keohane.

Thanks!

MarkSorry Paige - I was in South America last week - will respond today.Sorry for not getting back to you sooner (I was out of town last weeek) - 
unfortunately, I have a 2:00 already on my calendar but am available later.  
If you want to meet with Alan & Jeff first and see me afterwards, that's ok

I'll be on vacation then - see you in September!I see what you mean, and I can't explain the bcc - unfortunately, unless they 
use "mtaylo1@ect.enron.com" it doesn't get here.  It must just disappear into

MarkPlease note that my e-mail address is mtaylo1@ect.enron.com.  If you use

difference in the outcome, I don't really see the point.  Let me know if you 
disagree.

While a commodity forward contract which contains an asymmetrical default 
provision clearly does not have the characteristic of net settlement, we do 
not believe that Statement 133 is appropriately applied to any contract which 
requires the making and taking of delivery of a physical commodity absent a 
default, regardless of whether the default results in a termination payment 
which may be payable to the defaulting party.  An event of default and 
resulting termination of a commodity contract can have far reaching negative 
implications for the defaulting party well beyond the terms of the contract 
itself (e.g. damage to reputation and credit, triggering of cross-defaults, 
etc.).  ---------------------- Forwarded by Mark - ECT Legal Taylor/HOU/ECT on

Subject: Trading Documentation - Reminder

Brynjar

It was good seeing you on home ground the other day.

This is just a brief note to remind you of ECT Legal Department's policy 
regarding trading documents.

As you know, all trading documents must be approved by Legal before they can 
be used.  We maintain on a database in London all approved forms of trading 
documents and this database needs to be promptly up-dated as new market 
documents surface.

As our "first line of defence" it is very likely that you will encounter new 
trading forms before anyone else in the organisation. I would therefore ask 
you please to send to Martin Rosell any non-approved form of trading document 
(whether in the form of a broker confirm, an amendment to the NPTA Terms etc) 
as soon as you receive it. This will enable Martin to implement the approval 
process as quickly as possible.

Many thanks, as always, for your help.

Regards

Paul

Subject: Reference to telephone conversations on confirmations

I reviewed the ECT confirmation templates today and found that a reference is 
made to a telephone conversation on most of the templates for transactions 
under a ECT Master Agreement. 

The offending sentence is as follows:

"This is a confirmation of the following Transaction entered into with you 
pursuant to a telephone conversation on <<DealDate>> between the parties:"

I would like to change it to read as follows, with your approval:

"This is a confirmation of the following Transaction entered into between us 
on  <<DealDate>>:"


This change will allow the current templates to handle both telephone and 
internet trading.

Please advise.

Hey Dave!

Thanks for your note.  Believe it or not, it actually is "good to be back."  
And thanks to Louise's timely intervention, I actually get to stay in Houston 
this week instead of coming over to London for the ISDA meetings.

We discussed the need to have the lawyers review the long descriptions 
yesterday and Mark Dilworth is checking on whether or not all the lawyers 
actually have access to the necessary programs on their machines.  He and I 
are meeting later this morning to talk about several of the items in your 
note and we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to show all the 
lawyers involved how to use the system to review the long descriptions.

The other topics I had on my list to keep moving this week are the matching 
of GTC's with products and continued progress on the Counterparty spreadsheet.

Harry Collins is the emissions guy.  I'm assuming he'll be part of this 
process tomorrow and I'll ask him to take a close look at the long 
descriptions and how the mesh with the GTC's.

Finally, I agree with you on the GTC variables issue.  My plan is to ask the 
lawyers involved to focus on this as they review the long descriptions for 
which they are responsible.  With me here to answer questions that may result 
in more progress but I'm still not convinced that's enough.  I hope to be 
able to spend some of my own time looking at these as you have over the last 
couple of weeks but realistically I don't think that will happen very soon.  
Maybe you can help me prioritize:  should I look first at areas with 
predicted high volume or areas where we have the least confidence in the 
quality of work to date?

Talk to you soon.

Mark

Subject: Legal Stuff

Mark,

Welcome back!

I am wondering if you could lend a hand on a few areas on the legal side of 
EnronOnline:

1) GTC Cross reference (see prior email)
2) Product Long Descriptions - these are now available in the same format as 
the customer will see - i.e. all put together by the system, as opposed to 
individual sentences in a spreadsheet. The traders should have set up all of 
the products which were required for the simulation (I haven't confirmed 
this). These products would be a good place to start and should provide a 
representative sample for the lawyers to look at. There are a few changes 
coming, as requested by Louise Hansen, Stacy Dickson and Janice Moore which I 
have not yet incorporated (but hope to within the next 2 days or so) - 
otherwise, the other products should be OK as they contain text derived from 
the spreadsheets which the lawyers have approved.

It would be helpful if you could organize for each of the lawyers to access 
the Product Manager, so they can see the long descriptions for the Products. 
Someone in the Product Control Group should be able to show you how to access 
the long descriptions in the Product Manager 

3) Emissions - Are you the emissions guy? I haven't actually discussed these 
with anyone - not sure if the lawyer list I have includes the person who 
should be looking after this?

  Mark Taylor
  Leslie Hansen
  Jeff Hodge
  Janice Moore
  Alan Aronowitz
  Harry Collins
  Stacy Dickson 

4) I still do not have a warm and fuzzy feeling that the GTC variables have 
been properly cross-referenced to the spreadsheets, and that the two work 
together to form a cohesive whole. I might just be paranoid, but I think this 
area needs closer examination. Perhaps you could spot-check a couple of GTC's 
against the products and see what you think?

Thanks for your help


Dave




Thanks for the itinerary.  Please note that my e-mail address begins with 
mtaylo1, not mtaylor (which goes to Mitch Taylor).Please note that Mark Dilworth's demonstration scheduled for tomorrow morning 
(11:00 EB2601a) will not be of the entire EnronOnline system but will focus 
on the portion of the system that builds the long descriptions.  The system 
now builds the entire long description from the various elements - most of 
which we have already reviewed - and displays them as they will be viewed by 
counterparties online.  It is particularly important that the lawyers 
responsible for the long descriptions and the GTC's attend so that we can 
complete the review process.  If you can not attend, please let me know so we 
can set up a time for Mark to show you how to access the system.

Thanks,

MarkDave:

One item that was left open after my meeting with Mark D. this morning was 
what the Index should look like and how much input we have had from the 
confirm desk.  My inclination was that the index should be the same language 
that we currently use in the confirmation on the theory that the GTC taken 
together with the long description should result in a complete, unambiguous 
contract.  Mark felt that the index should provide a more complete 
description than the short description abbreviation but that the full legal 
text could wait for the paper confirm.

Given Mark's view as to how this field should be dealt with, it may be that 
the confirm desk has in fact looked at all of these and said they look fine 
as far as they go and has not attempted to correct them with the full legal 
language.

Mark said he would be contacting you himself but I thought it might make 
sense to give you my version as well.

What are your thoughts?  If you'd like to discuss, I will be in by 9:00 
tomorrow but have a meeting at 10 and then the meeting with all of the 
lawyers and Mark to discuss the further long description review at 11.  

MarkIt may be that you don't need to be there at all.  This relates to the online 
trading system that is being built and the legal review of various pieces of 
the system.  If you haven't been involved yet, it probably means that 
somebody else (maybe Wayne, Harry or Janice?) is responsible for the 
commodities you handle.  The project is only confidential in that we're 
trying to minimize information outside of Enron about it.  There's no problem 
talking about it internally.  You're certainly welcome to attend if you want 
to find out more about it, but if somebody else in your group is already 
covering things, you don't need to worry about it.

Subject: Re: State of Incorporation  

Tana,

State of incorporation has been captured for a large number of the 
counterparties and has been used as the basis for the determination of 
financial trading status by our tax group.

If we are going to prevent a utility/gov/pension fund from trading financial 
products because of state law and we have state of incorporation, we should 
ensure that the entity we are barring is at least in the same state as the 
law in question.

If this has not been the case, one way to update the information would be to 
list the states which have restrictive legislation and then apply the list to 
the companies for which we have state of incorporation information. An Excel 
Vlookup would accomplish this quite quickly. This is not perfect, but would 
at least ensure that utilities in states without the legislation are not 
barred - although I recognize it might bar some companies in states where the 
legislation may be so specific as not to preclude the trading of financial 
products for some utilities under certain circumstances.

Frank: Could you please forward an updated list of state of incorporation 
information to Tana?

One last point (thanks, Bob): If a particular state has restrictive 
legislation, is it our obligation to prevent the utility from trading 
financial products, or does the obligation rest with the utility? i.e. is 
there any reason for us to be barring them, or can we simply give them the 
ability to transact financial products with EnronOnline and rely on their 
internal controls? If we don't have any legal obligation to police, I'm 
reluctant to do anything which would imply we are assuming this 
responsibility.

Mark: Can you comment on this last point?

Thanks,

Dave

Subject: Re: State of Incorporation  

Our review of the counterparty list is not considering, for the most part, 
state of incorporation.  The biggest consideration with derivatives is the 
country of incorporation (and additionally, the country(ies) in which trading 
will take place).  For the bulk of our swap counterparties, i.e. energy 
companies, state law currently isn't an in issue on approval of swap 
trading.  It is more of an issues with governmentals, utilities, insurance 
companies, pension funds and the like, and we do not capture that information 
until we are in active neogtiation with a counterparty.  With utilities, you 
cannot make a general assumption that any particular state law that applies 
to one utility will apply to another.  Each utility need to be looked at 
individually to see which state or federal law may apply to that counterparty.

The bulk of you customer list is not financial counterparties we are in 
active negotiation with, so we are not capturing state of incorporation.  I 
know the Global Contracts Group has been trying to capture that information.  
You may want to talk to Mary Gosnell.




Just a 'heads up' - there is now no doubt that there will need to be some 
major revisions to the index language.  I am meeting with some of the folks 
from the confirm desks this afternoon to get them started on a further 
review.  Can you please arrange to have the following people given access to

Subject: re Westland Energie BV - capacity deals for 2000

The Netherlands power origination team have concluded the first of the 
so-called transmission deals with the above counterparty. This is a sale and 
buy back structure whereby Enron sells on a border basis to a Dutch 
distribution company who then sells back to Enron a proportion of the power 
on a free on Koppelnet basis. The Koppelnet is the Dutch grid.

The deals are designed to secure as much cross border capacity to take 
advantage of the still significant arbitrage between power prices within the 
Netherlands and those outside. At the moment the grid operator, TenneT, 
allocates transmission capacity on a pro rata basis without charge. This has 
led to significant gaming of the system with huge oversubscription for cross 
border capacity, and the structure we have developed in Enron has been 
designed to take advantage of the system and still stay within the rules laid 
down by TenneT and the regulator, the DTe. Should anyone like to have a copy 
of the 2 transaction agreements, then pls call me. 

We are in negotaitions with other distribution companies in relation to this 
structure.

tks    
Here's my revised version - let me know what you think.

Thanks for your note.  

If you are still trying to decide about shore excursions, I was just 
remembering my trip and have the following observations:

I found the volcano on the Big Island to be marginally interesting, not 
particularly pretty, and from where I was staying (Kona), a very long day.

Kauai was very beautiful - the Na Pali coast is particularly spectacular 
(that coast and the nearby beaches are where South Pacific was filmed) but it 
is quite rugged and nearly inaccessible as I remember it except on foot or by 
boat.  I would highly recommend seeing it by boat if that option is 
available, otherwise, you can just drive up to the end of the road and get a 
pretty good view.  There is also a river boat trip I didn't get to take so I 
can't recommend it - it was popular with visitors.

I didn't make it to Maui but I've always thought it would be fun to go to the 
top of the mountain to watch the sunrise (in a car or bus) and then ride down 
the hill on a bicycle.  

There was a bay near Honolulu on Oahu (near Diamond Head) where I did my 
first-ever snorkeling.  It was very popular (crowded) but a lot of fun and 
while there were plenty of fish to see the reef itself was pretty dead (not a 
lot of pretty coral).

I found the web site for the dolphin lab where I worked but a quick look 
didn't indicate they have a visitors center.  You might call them when you 
are there if you have the extra time and want to go.  
http://dolphin-institute.org/

As far as your clothes are concerned, since you won't have to carry them 
yourselves, why not  take them all!

Have a great trip!

Love, MarkThe language works for me as long as the long description describes 
multi-month options as a series of multiple options.

the only physical option in the U.S. at the moment is emissions. Are you 
happy to amend the emissions language in a manner similar to what Justin and

Subject: Index Wording

Mark,

Jennifer (PCG) has supplied me with example language from the confirmations 
which is representative of the the other confirmations. I agreed that you and 
I would rework a couple of examples for her, and then she can apply the same 
principles to the remaining descriptions.

I think the best way to proceed on this is if we work up example wording for 
most of the different publication types, and/or verify any wording suggested 
by Jennifer against the original confirm language.

I will bring up the originals to you, but my suggestion for a rework is:


Daily price midpoint example (For Gas Daily, Oklahoma-PEPL):

The Index for a day shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the 
following calendar day under the heading "Daily Price Survey" in the Oklahoma 
- PEPL section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a business day then 
the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next 
succeeding business day.


Monthly price example (For NGI, Northern California Border):

The Index for a month shall be the "Bidweek Average" price for the Northern 
Cal Border Average as listed in the table entitled "California Border & 
Non-Utility End-User Citygate tables", published in the first issue in such 
month of Natural Gas Intelligence Weekly Gas Price Index.

Monthly price example (For Inside Ferc, Texas,Oklahoma PEPL)

The Index for a month shall be the Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co - Texas, 
Oklahoma (mainline) price as listed in the section entitled "Prices of Spot 
Gas Delivered to Pipelines", published in the first issue in such month of 
Inside Ferc's Gas Market Report.


In each of the above examples, PCG will need to substitute the price name and 
section name for each of the applicable prices in each purblication.


Dave

I've put an hour on my calendar tomorrow afternoon to discuss conference 
issues.

Please advise at your earliest convenience on the below items.

I also need to go over the Master Billing Authorization form with you.  I 
will need to fax a completed form to the Conference Center, Tuesday, 9/28.

Recreation

The following recreational items are available for the conference attendees.  
Do you want to offer?  If so, what type of limitations:
 (TPC Golf $106 per person (includes cart fee) plus box lunch ($5-6.00))
 Tennis  - outdoor courts  (3) @ $12 hr per court
  - indoor courts  (3) @ $18 hr per court 
 Bike Rental @ $8  per 1/2 day
 Spa - See Taffy for menu of treatments - 3 treatments for a 10% discount??

Barbara suggested that we recruit Bob Walker to organize the golf outing.  Do 
you have any objection?

Business Center

I would suggest that we rent at least two additional faxes to accomodate our 
75+ attendees, since there is only one fax machine in the business center.  
The rate is $60 per additional line, plus rental of the fax machine.  Do you 
have any objection.

  


Give me a call with any questions.

Subject: Request for Editing

Mark,
We are one step away from signing a brand new, much needed master power 
agreement with Duke, with whom we presently have over $46 million of MTM in 
the money exposure without adequate contracts.  That one step is over the 
hurdle of how we calculate termination payments.  Please, as you have so 
helpfully done in the past,  edit the following conversation between Mr. Know 
it All and Mr. Struggler.

Know It All:  I don't have a lot of time so get to the point.

Struggler:  Why can't we supplement  the expression "present value of the 
economic benefit" when we define the word "Gains" with the expression:  
"using the Discount Rate" and defining the term so everybody understands how 
we calculate the present value of the  gains?

Know it All:   I've gone over this a number of times with you before, but 
here we go again:  there are a number of ways to calculate gains and losses.  
when we calculate our gains or losses, we are really just going One method is 
to go out to the market and asking a third party how much they would charge 
us (or pay us) to step into the tragically truncated transaction.   Because 
it is relatively fair, straightforward and easy enough to document, this 
would probably be our first approach in a default situation.

Struggler:  So, why don't we just say:  "the value of the foregone economic 
benefit?"  Why do we even have to say anything about the stupid present value 
of it?

Know it All:  Ahem, because, we want to maintain as much flexibility as 
possible and another method would be to calculate the total string of 
payments we might have expected to recieve from the defaulting party reduced 
by the payments we would have had to make.  Since we will receive the 
termination payment up front, it isn't fair to get the full amount of that 
total but rather only the "present value."  In addition, using the 
replacement transaction (market quote) method the present value is the 
already built into the curve price that's quoted you numbskull!  Another 
method would be to unwind our hedge on the other side of the terminated 
transaction - presumably the amount the counterparty to the hedge would 
charge (or pay) to unwind that transaction will be very close to the amount 
calculated by the market quotation (replacement transaction) method.  This 
last method is quite handy when the terminated transaction was entered into 
to offset a particular trade or when the market has dried up and there are no 
quotes to be had.

Struggler:  Okay,  my understanding of present value is that you imagine a 
guy who is going to get $100 at a future date, let us say, one year from 
now.  Do you follow me so far?

Know it All:  Please.

Struggler:  Now, instead of the guy getting the $100 one year from now, he 
gets it today.  But, the $100 today is worth a lot more  than it will be one 
year from now because the guy is also getting a year of time and time is 
money and he can invest the money at a known return rate and so if you gave 
him the full $100 today he would invest it and one year from now have  $170 
instead of $100 and that wouldn't be fair so you are supposed to give him 
today just the minimal amount you can get away with so he can invest it and 
come out with $100 one year from now.  And so, to figure out how much less 
than $100 to give the guy today, you "DISCOUNT" the $100 by some damn rate 
that everybody seems to know about.   Do you understand?

Know it All:   You've pretty well botched it up at a sixth grade level, but 
that's the idea.

Struggler:  So, now, if we are calculating the "present value of the economic 
gain" of a terminated transaction aren't we basically saying that we would 
have received $100 in the future for the power , however we now should get 
$30 because we have discounted it with the sacred rate and so why can't we 
say that the present value is derived from the "Discount Rate?"

Know it All:  Your lack of real world experience is painful to behold.  Pleae 
make sure you call somebody if you are ever asked to calculate one of these 
things.  The Curves price that is quoted to us by the presumably creditworthy 
replacement counterparty or the counterparty to a hedge that is being unwound 
already takes into account the present valuing principle.  And of course, if 
you end up having to discount a stream of payments, there are big problems.  
First, how will you figure out what those payments might have been?  This 
isn't a loan where principle and interest payments can be caluclated in 
advance with certainty - the payments will fluctuate witht the floating price 
in a swap or the cost of replacement power in a physical deal.  And even if 
we can figure that out how can we agree on the appropriate discount rate?  An 
in-the-money non-defaulting party wants it to be as low as possible since 
that will maximize the termination payment received.  But if the 
non-defaulting party is out-of-the-money then he will want the discount rate 
as high as possible to minimize the payment he has to make.  And just to 
complicate things a bit further, these contracts are usually bilateral so we 
have to be willing to eat what we serve.  So our contract language just says 
the whole thing has to be "commercially reasonable."  In our view that's 
enough to protect us from a rapacious counterparty if we default and flexible 
enough to let us come to a reasonable result when we are the non-defaulting 
party.

Struggler:  I thought the curve was just a list of prices.  You go out to 
October 2000 and you see $34.  Isn't that number the price we expect to pay 
for power or get paid for it on that future date and shouldn't we discount 
that number if we are getting the money one year early?

Know it All:  No!  That $34 is the present value amount we would be willing 
to pay today of what we think for power that will be delivered one year from 
now.

Struggler:  You mean we thing one year from now that power will actually be 
$100 and that discounted, it comes back to $34 on our curve at this very 
moment?

Know it All:  You've got it buddy.  Do you think you can handle that 
concept?  Or do I have to go over it again?  

Struggler:  Hmmm.  Well I guess so, but why don't we just say  "the value of 
the economic benefit based on the Non-Defaulting Party's curve"?

Know it All:  Because then somebody would want to define the word "curve" and 
at that point you are getting too close to our holy of holies and we won't 
ever define our curve.

Struggler.  Hmmm.  Okay.  Thanks.  



If Debbie is talking about the language she and I discussed late last week, 
that is new credit language that has not yet gone in to any of the GTC's.

Debbie, 

I am not sure which language you are referring to.  Some of the GTC's have 
language providing for the posting of a letter of credit by the counterparty 
when the Enron entity makes a request to do so.  Mark Taylor drafted this 
language.  I assume that it is the same as the financial language.  Please 
let me know this e-mail does not answer your question.

Subject:  Comments on SHCP meeting.

We have been having meetings with SHCP officials in the last 3 weeks. SHCP is
the government entity that is affected for crude price fluctuations, and has
hedged the crude exports from time to time, but they have not implemented a 
risk
management program yet. The volume of Mexico crude exports is close to 600 MM
Bbl / year, and they can hedge up to that volume.

Yesterday we have a meeting with Carlos Garcia Moreno and Rodrigo Ocejo. It is
possible that they already are hedging part of the volume, but they did not 
said
so. They were impressed with Enron's capability of taking the volume
(transaction up to 50 MM Bbl) and were interested in Enron's market view for
2000. They are interested in quotes for calls, puts and swaps for Cal 2000, 
1st
and 2nd half of 2000 and Cal 2001.

We do not know yet, what is the financial agent that they use to do this
transactions, buy we believe that it can be Nafin or Banco de Mexico.

We think it is necessary start working on the ISDA and a Confidentiality
Agreement with SHCP asap, in order to be ready when the time comes to close 
the
transaction.

We are going to continue meeting these people and start quoting them the 
periods
and instruments they are interested in. Also, we are sending them today a 
Enron
Annual Report.

Agustin Perez




My analysis is that forcing the scroll through the entire agreement provides 
additional comfort that the counterparty has actually looked at the agreement 
and knows to what they are agreeing - it is that much more likely that the 
contract will be enforceable.  It is certainly not necessary from my point of 
view that the document take up the entire page rather than appearing in a 
smaller window with a scroll bar down the side - in fact I think that looks 
much better.  It would be acceptable from a legal point of view if the 
"agree" button appeared as in the example below as long as it didn't work 
until the agreement had been scrolled through.  I personally think that would 
create more problems from a commercial point of view since many 
counterparties will try to click on "agree" as soon as it appears without 
reading the agreement and get frustrated when it doesn't work right away.  

David - do you agree?

Louise,

Below is an example of where a legal agreement which you are required to 
accept, where the "Accept" & "Decline" buttons are below the actual agreement 
and not within the agreement.  The agreement itself is within a separate 
frame above the buttons.

A line of instructional line of copy is given at the top telling users to 
read the agreement by paging down and then to click on accept to continue.

A similar set up would be suitable for the GTC's as these can vary in length 
between products and would allow us to control the size of the window which 
should not cover up the whole quotes screen.

Let me know what you think.

Hey Marc - 

I'm here - it's actually nice to be home & not traveling for a while.  Will 
you guys be around this weekend?

It doesn't look like I can help your friend.  We almost never hire lawyers 
fresh out of law school.  Believe it or not, they don't really teach you how 
to be a lawyer in law school so passing the bar is just the first step.  Your 
first job is where your real training takes place.  We just don't have the 
time and capacity to train junior lawyers so we try to hire people who have 
worked for a number of years (usually at least 5 or 6) at a good law firm.  
They get good training there and we don't have to hassle with it.

Subject: Enron-Wide Global Counterparty Implementation - Code of Conduct 
Guidance/Approval Requested

We have been asked to implement the Global Counterparty (GCP) system at 
Portland General and EES to support Global Credit Aggregation with our major 
trading partners.  This information includes Counterparty Name, various 
Address data such as documentation (confirmation), headquarters, and 
settlement (including wire bank, ABA, and routing), and various contact names 
and phone numbers such as trader, settlements, etc.

For Global Credit Aggregation to be supported most efficiently, all Enron 
companies must utilize a common identifier for the counterparty on a trade, 
i.e., Southern Energy Marketing for Portland = Southern Energy Marketing for 
ECT = Southern Energy Marketing for EES = Southern Energy Marketing for 
EPMI.  Global Credit must 'see' exposure from each affiliate for a 
counterparty as the same party to aggregate to a corporate level.

For Portland General, the list of trading partners are mostly parties we 
already have in the GCP database.  However, there will be some counterparties 
that are specific to Portland General (the same could also be true about 
EES).  For that reason, I would like to train specific individuals at each 
company to perform the GCP administration/maintenance for their 
counterparties much like we handle the ECT London and Calgary operations.  
What we will have is a system shared as depicted below :




 

There would be select individuals at each company to maintain their 
counterparty information via Terminal Server in a common database maintained 
here in Houston by ECT IT.   This type of access would give these individuals 
access to Counterparty data for all companies regardless of their own company 
affiliation. Each company/business unit will have an extract or view from the 
main database of only their counterparties to support their trading and 
downstream systems versus those systems being integrated directly with the 
main database containing all information.

What I need to know is whether any of you see a problem with this 'sharing' 
of technology and data between ECT and PGE or EES and the intended 
implementation.  Based on Bill Dassenko's understanding of the FERC Code of 
Conduct, we think this proposal is within the guidelines.  Please provide any 
comments or your acceptance of this proposal by Monday, December 21st.    

Thank you.

Mary,

This is the list we talked about. Reviewing it briefly, I only see a few that 
we don't already have in GCP. In discussing this with Bill (Dassenko), he 
sees no reason under the FERC code of conduct that we cannot see ( or share) 
public information  about shared counterparties such as would be populated in 
GCP. He is prohibited from sharing specific deal info or exposures, neither 
of which would be an issue in GCP. Hope this helps...I'll be back in on 
Tuesday and we can talk more if you need to.

Debbie,
Attached is a file containing PGE's list of counterparties.  There are a few 
financial counterparties which I have not yet included on this list. All 
names on the list are wholesale counterparties with which PGE trades power or 
gas or are wholesale customers.  There are no retail customers on this list.

In general, under the FERC "Code of Conduct" rules established for working 
with affiliated companies, the unregulated entity (ECT, EPMI) can tell all to 
the regulated entity, but the regulated entity (PGE) can share in only the 
most general of terms. Further,  PGE conversations can not convey any 
information which is otherwise not public about PGE's markets or customers.  
Although the question is a good, I believe I have more to worry about when 
talking to you than what you do when talking to me. Given that I have 
included as complete a list as I have.

Christian Yoder is the ECT lawyer who is tasked with code of conduct
issues for ECT.  His phone number is 503-464-7845.

Please respond to Jennifer with your comments today, if possible. I will be

Thanks,

The Index for a month shall be the mean of the arithmetic averages of the 
prices per Short Ton for each such calendar month for Short Ton of 26 Lb. 
Semichemical Medium, delivered in the Eastern U.S. as listed under the 
heading: "Price Watch: Paperboard/Packaging: Grade: Corrugated medium (26 
lb): Semichemical, East" in the issue of Pulp and Paper Week that reports 
prices effective for the calendar month.


Here are several of the contracts we are planning to use for the online 
system.  I wish I could tell you these are the final (or even the most 
recent) versions of the documents but things have changed so frequently that 
I'm afraid these may not be quite up to date.  They do have the advantage of 
being in my directory and therefore available to send to you today.  I don't 
think the final changes will be significant but if you want to use these as 
starting points, please let me know so I can be sure you have the latest 
material.

The PA is the Password Application which is the only document the prospective 
counterparty actually signs by putting pen to paper.  The first time the 
counterparty logs on to the system with its approved password, it is required 
to agree to the ETA (Electronic Trading Agreement) by clicking on an "I 
Agree" box after scrolling through the agreement.  The GTC's are the 
contractual terms that apply to online transactions if there is no master 
agreement in place.  Legal will have the ability to restrict a counterparty 
to trading only certain products online if we feel it is necessary.  While 
most financial transactions will be governed by GTC's that look like our 
"Omnibus" documentation, the weather derivatives look more like a "Deemed 
ISDA."  One final complication, the credit group has asked us to create two 
sets of documents: one for highly creditworthy counterparties which will have 
no credit provisions included and a second set for counterparties credit is 
not quite comfortable with which will contain a provision allowing us to call 
for collateral if we choose.

Subject: Forcenergy Asset Sale





FYI
Below is a report on the Forcenergy bankruptcy case I received this morning.

Forcenergy Seeks OK For Asset Sale, Bidding Procedures
Forcenergy Inc. has asked the court to authorize the sale of seven
oil and gas properties to Hilcorp Energy I L.P. as well as procedures
designed to draw competing bids for the assets through an auction.
The motion, filed Sept. 13 with the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in New Orleans, requests permission to sell five
Louisiana and two Texas properties and related assets to
Hilcorp, subject to better offers. Hilcorp has offered
Forcenergy $6,086,000 in cash for the properties.
Sierra Mineral Development L.C. indicated interest
in purchasing the Texas and Louisiana properties in late
1998. In March, one month after signing a letter of interest
with Sierra, Forcenergy filed for Chapter 11 relief. Hilcorp
then agreed to finance Sierra?s purchase of the Forcenergy
properties. Any purchase agreement will list only the
names of Forcenergy and Hilcorp.
The terms of the agreement include Hilcorp?s
responsibility to "assume all liabilities related to the Property
after the Effective Date, and all Plugging and Abandonment
Obligations and Environmental Obligations, if any,
regardless of when incurred," the filing reports.
Forcenergy claims that this is a fortuitous time for
the approval of the sale due to the current stable cash flow,
the production of its onshore properties, and the potential
for sustained growth in its offshore Gulf of Mexico drilling
facilities.
The oil and gas explorer and producer also
requested the approval of overbid procedures, recognizing
that new interest in Forcenergy?s properties may come
after other interested parties review the purchase agreement.
Any person submitting an overbid to counsel for
the creditors? committee, Hilcorp, Forcenergy, and the
Bank Group is subject to offering a price of no less than
$6,236,000 and the elimination of any break up expense
reimbursement.
Competing bidders for the assets must submit a
deposit equal to 10% of its bid plus evidence that it is able
to consummate the transaction.

After the last overbid, the court will allow Hilcorp
the opportunity to overbid by an additional $50,000. Any
further bidding will continue in $50,000 increments.
If the court approves the purchase of the properties
by a bidder other than Hilcorp, Forcenergy would pay up
to the $100,000 that Hilcorp estimates it will incur as its
costs and fees related to the sale. If a break-up expense
reimbursement becomes necessary, Hilcorp will provide
documentation of expenses to the court.
Forcenergy also asked the court to approve its list
and calculation of amounts to be paid to cure all of its pre-petition
defaults.
"If no amount is listed, the Debtor believes that
there is no Pre-Petition Cure Amount due and owing to that
party," the motion states.
"The Debtor requests that, unless a party files an
objection to the Pre-Petition Cure Amount so scheduled
and serves a copy on Debtor?s counsel by the time to be
fixed by the Court at the Procedures Hearing, such party
should be forever barred from objecting to the Pre-Petition
Cure Amount," the filing further contends.
The company?s revenues declined after a decrease
in gas and oil prices in late 1998 and early 1999. The
declining revenues also negatively impacted the company
after 1997 and 1998 acquisitions outlays.
The court has not yet set a hearing date on the
bidding procedures request. DBR

My only concern is knowing which way the Inside FERC price adjustment that is 
submitted will go - will it always be plus or always minus?  If so, let's say 
so.  If not, how will it be clear on the web site which direction the 
adjustment is going?

EPMI and RMT are two different corporations.  As I understand it, in North 
America EPMI enters into only physical power transactions with third parties 
while ENA enters into financial transactions.  RMT handles financial 
transactions between wholly-owned Enron companies.  If the transaction you 
are handling is a derivative between ENA and Australia, it should be 
documented as two trades: one between ENA and RMT and the other between RMT 
and Australia.  That's why the master agreement is between RMT and 
Australia.  I don't know how the booking is handled.

The Enpower ticket shows our Counterparty as Enron Australia  Energy Pty

Limited, since I sent an e-mail to David Minns yesterday asking him to 
anticipate the delivery of the Confirmation. David is the party who is 
handling the ISDA MAster Agreement and is awaiting the Confirmation.

The ISDA MAster Agreement is between RMT (as opposed to EPMI) and Enron 
Australia Finance Energy Pty Limited. If RMT and EPMI are synonomous (as are 
RMT and ENA) then we're done. If they are not, then we have a booking issue 
AND a Master Agreement issue.

Perhaps Susan or Mark can help.

Subject: Commodity Derivatives Committee (Norway)

Earlier today, Thor Lien and I held a 1.5 hours presentation for the ten 
members of the above Committee.  The Committee has been assigned the task of 
examining issues related to commodity derivatives trading in Norway and to 
propose a concrete regulatory framework (currently financial commodity 
trading is not regulated in Norway) on 15 June next year at the latest.  

The background knowledge of the Committee members, representing different 
Norwegian interests, appeared to be quite shifting; while certain Committee 
members had in-depth knowledge of, for instance, EU capital requirements 
others revealed limited understanding of the functioning of the power 
markets.  The Committee took a great interest in the two regulatory points 
that I brought up, the lack of recognition of close-out netting in Norway and 
the forthcoming implications of CAD2.  The discussions sometimes were vivid, 
but I believe that we succeeded in getting most of our message through.  

The vice-chairman of the Committee (lawyer) invited us to render further 
comments in writing and said that he would return to us for further 
discussions when the drafting process was about to start next year.

The same people may be involved but there are tax savings achieved by passing 
all the derivatives through RMT.

I am confused on one point:

" If the transaction you are handling is a derivative between ENA and 
Australia, it should be documented as two trades: one between ENA and RMT and 
the other between RMT and Australia."

It is my understanding that RMT and ENA are the same 'people'. That being the 
case, if we sleeve the RMT to Australia between RMT to ENA, we really haven't 
accomplished anything. 

A question for you and Sue:

Should we be sleeving RMT to EPMI, a relationship for which we DO HAVE a 
Master Agreement in place - if that's where we want the risk to lie.

Dale

Patricia, after our conversation last week, we put together a complete 
analysis
of the credit risk that we see in the Colombian environment. I really 
appreciate
you take a look and if you have questions please let us know.

We have already requested audited financial statements for the Enercomsa
end-users, however it is not a common practice here in Colombia to request 
this
information. Apparently Enercomsa has been able to collect some of that
information, but it is unclear at this point if we will be able to get 
financial
statements from all customers. We also would like to have your view on this 
and
what would be the risk analysis procedures in this case.

Regards,

Pedro Fernando Manrique

We have not decided "to prevent any regulated utility from completing any 
financial transactions" online.  If we have already satisfactorily concluded 
the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will 
be approved.  It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet 
been researched that we are withholding approval.  The due diligence required 
involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their 
organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant 
state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there 
and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular 
utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the 
utility's counsel.  We usually begin that process only when a trader believes 
there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to 
justify the time and expense.  FYI, the due diligence process has in the past 
revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives 
or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.

A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to 
40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process.

On Friday we will be receiving the remaining customer list from credit, due

Any problems with this please notify me immediately as we are now running up 
against very tight deadlines in terms of getting all of the information in 
the system for the launch schedule.

Thanks

Mark,
On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has 
been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial 
transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones 
can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs?  
ie their decision whether to trade or not.
Louise


Looks good to me.  Are we certain that all of the other traders plan to post 
daily volumes?

the current paper descriptions says:

"....Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by 
Counterparty on the website (the Fixed Price) in each case in respect of the 
Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the 
term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period. The Notional Quantity 
per Determination Period is the volume submitted multiplied by the number 
days in the relevant Determination Period."

suggestion:

"....Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by 
Counterparty on the website (the Fixed Price) in each case in respect of the 
Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the 
term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period. The Notional Quantity 
per Determination Period is the volume submitted by Counterparty on the 
website."

If you all agree, I'll make this change in the BlackMaster. Dave, it may need 
lawyers validation?

Subject: Revised GTCs

Dave,

Attached below are the OnLine GTCs that contain the appropriate U.S. federal 
tax language.  As you'll see, our changes are reflected either by underline 
or strikeout in each of the documents.  The 3 attachments below are as 
follows:

  1.  ENA financial GTC
  2.  Enron Canada financial GTC
  3.  ENA HDD swap GTC

As you know, ENA financial (credit) and Enron Canada financial (credit) GTCs 
exist in addition to the ENA financial and Enron Canada financial GTCs.  The 
language that we inserted in the attached ENA financial and Enron Canada 
financial GTCs should also be inserted in the ENA financial (credit) and 
Enron Canada financial (credit) GTCs.  In addition, there are several weather 
derivative swap GTCs.  The language set forth in the attached ENA HDD swap 
GTC will need to be inserted in all other ENA weather derivative swap GTCs 
(credit and non-credit).

Also, please note that the message you forwarded to me from Leslie Hansen 
appears to relate to the U.S. state tax language to be inserted into certain 
GTCs.

Please call me at 3-5777 if you'd like to discuss further.

Best regards,

Jeff

Subject: Revised GTCs



Per our (separate) discussions, I have revised the GTCs to reflect (i) the
counterparty's representation that it is a domestic corporation (which, if
correct, would permit us to avoid back-up withholding on reportable
payments, if any, made pursuant to this GTC) and (ii) the requirement that
we provide the relevant forms to the counterparty in the event the
counterparty notifies us that it is not a domestic corporation.

Mark - David has also asked for a Texas law version of this document.  Would

of Texas law.  Please feel free to give Michael Brown or myself a call if you

Looks like we will have some counterparties in Mexico who we would like to

Can you coordinate the preparation of the ETA and PA for Mexico?  (I assume

I was glad to see that the next Monmouth meeting was rescheduled for a time 
other than December.  I guess Monmouth is a little harder to get to than 
Chicago but it will be nice to see the campus again.

I'm going to be in New York Nov. 1 & 2.  Any chance of getting together?

MarkThe difficulty is in knowing which entites are regulated and which are not.  
For instance, ENA is an "unregulated" affiliate of a regulated utility 
(PGE).  But many utilities have energy services companies affiliates which, 
while not regulated utilities like San Diego Gas & Electric, are nevertheless 
heavily regulated.  We have tried to figure out what we can in the time 
available and have relied on readily available public inofrmation.

Mark,

Does the legal precedent which we previously discussed, apply to subsidiaries 
of utilities as well as the utilities themselves?

As far as your email questions, my responses are following:

1.  The list I have provided you is the only list that exists on financial 
counterparties.  There is no Excel spreadsheet to follow.
2.  Duke Energy Corporation.  At Mark's direction, I am sending his note 
below regarding utilities.  Again, until we do the due diligence on a utility 
counterparty we have no way of knowing what kind of local, state or federal 
regulation or approvals they may be subject to.   We currently have masters 
in place with only about 10 utilities/govt's.  We are in the process of 
negotiating another 30.  Until those masters are executed and we have the 
relevant resolutions, authority documents and/or legal opinions, I cannot 
approve them for online trading.  I have made every effort to search company 
websites and elicit from Credit whether a counterparty is a regulated utility 
or not.  If I cannot tell by the information available to me, additional due 
diligence will be needed to see if they are subject to local, state, or 
federal regulation.   Mark can override any decision I have made, I can only 
make decisions within the guidelines the attorneys have set for me.
3.  Montana Power Trading and Marketing Company is a subsidiary of a 
regulated utility.  I am unable to determine from Credit or their website 
what type of regulation they might be subject to.  The note is true that 
Credit says they are getting out of the business anyway.
4.  Petrotemex.   Per my conversations with Mark and our advice from counsel, 
unlike U.S. and U.K. counterparties, Mexican counterparties are not able to 
enter into derivative transactions unless their articles and bylaws 
specifically provide for these types of transactions.  We will not know this 
until the due diligence is completed, so I am supposed to say "no" for 
Mexican counterparties we do not have a master swap agreement in place with.
5.  PSEG. It is an energy services company; however, it is also not an 
eligible swap participant (or "ESP").  CFTC regulation limits the derivatives 
trading we may do to certain types of counterparties that meet certain 
financial requirements (large, institutional type investors, companies, 
banks, etc).  Corporations and partnerships have to meet certain net worth 
and asset levels or we cannot trade financially with them.  Whenever I say 
"not ESP" or "not eligible swap participant" it means they have not met the 
financial net worth test.
6.  The American Coal Company.  See prior note.

Subject: Online Derivatives Trading with Regulated Utilities  

We have not decided "to prevent any regulated utility from completing any 
financial transactions" online.  If we have already satisfactorily concluded 
the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will 
be approved.  It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet 
been researched that we are withholding approval.  The due diligence required 
involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their 
organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant 
state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there 
and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular 
utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the 
utility's counsel.  We usually begin that process only when a trader believes 
there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to 
justify the time and expense.  FYI, the due diligence process has in the past 
revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives 
or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.

A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to 
40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process.

Mark,
On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has 
been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial 
transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones 
can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs?  
ie their decision whether to trade or not.

We are getting very excited about the BVI.  It's hard to believe it's only 5 
weeks away.  I try to think about it whenever the stock market gets me 
depressed (which is happening with altogether too much frequency these 
days).  I see you guys got hit with a triple whammy today.  Oh well, can you 
say "buying opportunity"?

are free for dinner on Sunday the 31st?  We also need to talk about $ 
sometime soon since I made the final payment on the boat a couple of weeks 
ago.  Have you made your hotel arrangements (we still have a room reserved 
for you for the night of the 20th which you won't need if you've made other 
arrangements - and we can always get you a room there for the last night if 
you want)?   And there's still the beverage list (you did get my fax, didn't 
you?).  

T. sends regards.  Hope you're well and not letting the market roller-coaster 
get you down (my mantra is "think long term, think long term, think long 
term").

have not yet opened the system to the entire web - you have to be on the

Subject: EOL - Master versus Online GTCs

The underlying contractual structure for trades effected on-line between the 
relevant Enron entity and a Counterparty is as follows:

if there is an existing Master for the particular product between the 
contracting parties, that Master will govern on-line trades.
if there is no Master between the parties, then the applicable on-line GTCs 
will apply. 

If the terms of a Master are unacceptable to us for whatever reason (e.g. due 
to insufficient credit provisions), then it may be appropriate to terminate 
that Master.  
If however, we wish to keep a Master in place but do not wish to use it for 
on-line trades, then the counterparty needs to be notified of this and give 
its consent.  Such notice could state that until the Master had been suitably 
amended (i.e. by the negotiation of new credit provisions), then the on-line 
GTCs will apply.

I am in receipt of your e-mail with respect to the above-referenced topic.  
It seems to me that the position Justin Boyd outlined is the one that will 
need to be followed in the US for physical trades.  The Trading Partner 
Agreement which a party will agree to on-line specifically states that if a 
master exists between the parties, then that master will govern any on-line 
transactions.  For those parties who have masters that have been deemed 
insufficient, something will have to be done to override the Trading Partner 
Agreement.  That is what Justin is suggesting-a procedure to override 
unacceptable masters.

If that does not answer your questions, please give me a call.

        Thanks, Jeff

We have left a message with Jeff McMahon to see if he will take commercial

who is authorized.  In the past we have had Dana Gibbs help us out - which is

takes responsibility as far as P&L goes.  I'm not sure it works from a tax

then it could get us in a tough spot with the tax man.  Our preferred

the proper ECT-NA support for these transactions.  If tax reasons are driving 
these deals to ECT-NA, perhaps we will need a side letter where ECT-Europe

I fully agree with the "fade" effect.  But this looks right to me.  As I 
remember it, we were not totally happy with the Notional Quantity language 
but this was the best we could do.  We were going to make sure that whether 
the submitted volume was per day or per month was clearly reflected elsewhere 
in the long description.  Not elegant, but adequate.

Financial Gas Options:

A Transaction under which the Option Buyer has the right, in relation to the 
Option Seller, in return for payment of the Total Premium by the Premium 
Payment Date, to receive after exercise of the Option with respect to a 
Determination Period, the Cash Settlement Amount for such Determination 
Period being, for a Put Option the Strike Price minus the Floating Price for 
such Determination Period, in respect of the Notional Quantity, and for a 
Call Option the Floating Price for such Determination Period minus the Strike 
Price in respect of the Notional Quantity. The Notional Quantity shall be the 
volume for the relevant Determination Period (calculated using the volume 
submitted by counterparty).  The Total Premium shall be the price submitted 
by Counterparty via EnronOnline multiplied by the sum of the Notional 
Quantities for each Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the 
term of the Transaction shall be a Determination Period.  The Payment Date(s) 
shall be the fifth Business Day following the date on which the Floating 
Price is determinable.The Floating Price shall be the Index. 


but, I'm not sure if this is latest version we came up with. Could you check

The first long product type description below defines a paper product. In all 
paper/pulp products, with the exception of the second one below, 
the description uses the words "volume submitted multiplied by the number of 
days".
Bob Crane of Paper / Pulp Trading, said this confusing due to the commodity 
is monthly delivey. He would like the words "multiplied by the number of 
days" removed from the long descriptions of the paper/pulp product types. 
Should we delete the whole sentence possibly? (See second desription below.)

Thanks for your note.  Of the three you have listed, #1643 is probably a bit 
far from public transport for me.  #1671 is convenient to the business I have 
on Mon. & Tues. (what is Double SS?).  #1966 sounds like a fun location.  I'd 
be willing to spend more for a place that is particularly well furnished or 
interesting (any loft spaces?).

Subject: Cash Collateral in Canada

I have spoken with Daivd Mitchell about the issue that I raised in my e-mail 
yesterday regarding which law would govern the "perfection" of our interest 
in cash collateral pledged to Enron North America Corp. by a Canadian 
counterparty and held by us in an account in the US.  David confirmed that 
while a New York/Texas court should apply US law for perfection purposes, 
there is a possibility that a court would say that the law where the pledgor 
is located would govern perfection.  Because of this uncertainty and because 
of the perfection issues under Canadian law regarding cash collateral, do you 
all agree that in our masters involving ENA and a Canadian counterparty that 
Cash is not an acceptable form of collateral?


Peter, 
As I mentioned to you yesterday, with respect to LC's that are issued for our 
benefit, there could be a circumstance where we would draw and hold the cash 
as collateral.  In that circumstance, I think we need some guidnace from you 
and Stikeman as to what we should be doing to perfect our interest in such 
cash.  I would be interested in knowing whether in a bankruptcy context 
involving a Canadian counterparty, whether the court would hold that such 
cash proceeds are property of the estate.

Let me know what you think.  My assistant is trying to set up a call with 
you, me and Shari to go through the other Canadian law issues that I raised 
in my e-mail to you yesterday.

It's been long enough since I spent any time in the city that I don't really 
know what the good places are now.  Il Mulino and Union Square Cafe were

Just something to keep in mind as you are evaluating your investments:

The tribal wisdom of the Dakota Indians, passed on from one generation
to the next, says that when you discover you are riding a dead horse,
the best strategy is to dismount.

However, in modern business, because of the heavy investment factors to
be taken into consideration, often other strategies have to be tried
with dead horses, including the following:

     1.   Buying a stronger whip.
     2.   Changing riders.
     3.   Threatening the horse with termination.
     4.   Appointing a committee to study the horse.
     5.   Arranging to visit other sites to see how they ride dead horses.
     6.   Lowering the standards so that dead horses can be included.
     7.   Appointing an intervention team to reanimate the dead horse.
     8.   Creating a training session to increase the riders load share.
     9.   Reclassifying the dead horse as living-impaired.
     10.  Change the form so that it reads: "This horse is not dead."
     11.  Hire outside contractors to ride the dead horse.
     12.  Harness several dead horses together for increased speed.
     13.  Donate the dead horse to a recognized charity, thereby deducting
          its full original cost.
     14.  Providing additional funding to increase the horse's performance.
     15.  Do a time management study to see if the lighter riders would
          improve productivity.
     16.  Purchase an after-market product to make dead horses run faster.
     17.  Declare that a dead horse has lower overhead and therefore performs
          better.
     18.  Form a quality focus group to find profitable uses for dead horses.
     19.  Rewrite the expected performance requirements for horses.
     20.  Promote the dead horse to a supervisory position.Ha Ha

- or at least some good food.

The Moorings said they should be able to put your part on the credit card if 
you want.  Their number is 800-535-7289; our contract number is 507645 and 
it's under my name.  The guy I talked to said he'll have to call during 
regular business hours when the bookkeeping department is open.  Each 
person's share is currently $905.33.  That includes one night in the Moorings 
hotel so will go down by 55.50 or so if you decide not to stay there at all.  
Beverages are covered by a separate payment.  I'll be glad to fax the invoice 
when you get a number for me.  If you want to send me your check, that's 
fine, or Bruce can do it - makes no difference to me.

Regarding "connectedness,"  there were no internet cafes the last time I was 
there.  While that may have changed, there won't be more than one or two in 
the entire place, I'm sure.  Were you planning on bringing your laptop?  If 
so, it would make sense to find a 12 volt charger cable that will plug into a 
lighter socket or bring extra batteries - we won't have 110 volt current on 
the boat except the first - and maybe one other - night.  It will be easy to 
check voice mails since we will have a cell phone on board.  But it's not 
cheap (as I remember it it was $1/min. to receive a call from the States and 
$2/min. to place one) and I'm reasonably comfortable that you won't be able 
to plug into it.  I'm not sure if your US cell phone will work there or not.  
We can find out from the Moorings.  I have an international cell phone I'm 
bringing along that also has infrared capability.  Does your laptop have one 
of those ir receivers?  If so, I can bring along the software you need to 
work it with this phone.  Not to be defeatist and I'm sure the times have 
changed but I remember one trip 7 or 8 years ago where a friend needed to 
receive & send some faxes so we stopped at a little island hotel and asked if 
we could use their fax machine - they said yes but had never seen anyone send 
or receive more than a 2 or 3 page fax before and our 50 and 60 pagers soon 
ran the machine out of paper.  When we asked for more paper it turns out we 
had used the last piece on the island - they were not amused.  

Ted asked me to remind you to be thinking about music.  Let me just add in 
the spirit of self-preservation that it's a good idea.  It's not safe to 
ignore this issue since if we leave him to his own devices we may not hear 
much other than Van Halen and Iron Maiden.  Obviously feel free to bring as 
many of your own cd's as you want & if you let us know what types of tunes 
you like we'll try and bring ours (if any) that match.  Don't worry too much 
about Ted's taste - I always insist that he bring along a Walkman & 
headphones!

Glad to hear the company is doing well, but just in case you need some ideas 
with some of your projects, I got this from a friend this morning:

provisions built into the already executed Master Agreement - they want the 
ability to use the GTC with the credit provisions that allow us to call for a 
letter of credit whenever we want to instead of having the online trade 
governed by the master (as provided for automatically in the ETA).  What do 
you think about Edmund's solution?

Subject: Online Trading - GTC/Master variation

Dear Jeff and Mark,

Justin and I have been discussing the way we should approach variation of the 
ETA in respect of counterparties with whom we have an existing master 
agreement, but for whom we want to have transactions governed by the 
applicable GTC for the product in question.

The initial plan was to issue a letter to the counterparty asking it to sign 
and return a letter agreement which would vary the provision of ETA which 
states that a master agreement will govern all transactions.  We have now 
reformulated our position and drafted a letter (attached below) which will 
simply be sent to the relevant counterparty, but which will not require it to 
sign and return any documents.

We believe that this letter will provide for an effective variation of the 
ETA by stating that the counterparty's acceptance of the GTC on the EOL 
system will mean that that GTC will govern transactions, and not the master 
agreement.  We do not think that we need to make an explicit reference to the 
ETA.  Obviously for this to work, such counterparty will have to be presented 
with the 'Accept GTC' button at the usual juncture in the system. 

In addition, we thought it best to remove an explantory paragraph stating 
that we will be writing to the counterparty at a future date to revise the 
credit provisions of the master (the whole reason for having the counterparty 
accept the GTC over the master!!).

Obviously we welcome your thoughts on this issue and the attached draft.  I 
also presume you will need to take a view as to whether varying the ETA in 
this way will be effective under New York law. 

Best regards,

Edmund.

Subject: Re: Local Counsel Questions  

Dear All,

Following Mark's and David's request for the due diligence questionnaires 
that we have used in Europe for EOL, I am pleased to attach the following:

1. Questionnaire regarding internet trading
2. Questionnaire regarding commodity derivatives trading




A couple of points I'd like to make:

- the internet questionnaire refers to the European Economic Area "passport" 
(entitling you to trade in one EEA country by vitue of being regulated by 
another EEA country). Obviously this is not appropriate for S. America or 
Oceania and Asia. It is possible that you have some similar mechanism.
- the energy commodity questionnaire considers commodity derivatives trading. 
This questionniare was only sent to local counsel in jurisdictions for which 
we had not already undertaken derivatives due diligence.  In respect of 
physical commodity trading, based on the due diligence we have done to date 
in Europe, we have not undertaken any further due diligence for trading via 
EOL. If you feel that you need to undertake any physical trading due 
diligence, we have a set of questionnaires which I would be happy to pass on 
to you to use as you see fit.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any queries or questions about any 
of the above - otherwise, happy hunting!

Best regards, Edmund.

Would you be available to take Andrea Calo to dinner next Wednesday (the 
night before the Legal Conference)?  She is coming in a day early to meet & 
chat with people here.






As presently drafted the ETA provides that if a master agreement is in force 
covering a particular transaction, the master controls.  I don't think we 
ever adequately resolved the multiple Enron entity issue, though.  For 
example, if a counterparty has an ISDA Master Agreement in place with ENA, 
that master agreement could easily cover a trade based on UK gas prices.  
However, it is not the commercial people's intent that the system work that 
way.  They want every trade for a particular product to be with a single 
Enron entity (e.g. all UK gas transactions are with Enron Europe), regardless 
of what master agreements are in place.  To resolve this I suggest that the 
long descriptions be revised to state the Enron trading entity for each 
product type (this is already in place for European derivatives) and that the 
ETA be revised as follows:

revise the fifth line of paragraph (a) of Section 3 such that Transactions 
are governed by the short and long definitions in respect of a product 
"...and any master agreement between Counterparty and the Enron entity 
trading in such product on the Website which is in effect as of the date of 
the execution of such Transaction..."

(underlined text inserted) 

I think this will please the commercial and tax people; any thoughts from the 
legal side?I'm afraid I may never have called you back on this one - do we still need to 
discuss?

Mark,

Please call me re: verbatim use of wording between EOL and Confirms.

Also:

PCGs are checking back with confirms people regarding index descriptions and 
location, to make sure things are properly covered off. They are also going 
through the descriptions to identify cases where traders have grabbed 
incorrect items against the products they have created. Additional system 
controls are going in today and into next week to stop this sort of error 
from happening.

Elizabeth and Leslie:
Enclosed is the setoff langauge that we put into our financial master

which I have highlighted.   Does this sound plausible to you and if so, why?  
Are there some utilility counterparties that could agree to this?

Subject: Re: Online Trading - GTC/Master variation



If the PA and ETA are still structured as they were when I last saw them, the 
PA (which will be manually signed) binds the counterparty to the ETA and the 
ETA says that transactions will be governed by a master agreement, if any, or 
GTCs, if no master.  Assuming that is still the case, it seems to me that a 
letter sent to the counterparty, but not signed by it, will likely not 
override the PA and ETA already agreed to.  This seems particularly 
problematic if the reason for trying to override the ETA is to take advantage 
of better credit terms in the GTCs.  It seems to me that we would be better 
off either changing the ETA or supplementing it on-line; that way, we would 
at least have a click agreement, which the counterparty has agreed to be 
bound by.  Perhaps we should discuss further.  Thanks.

>>> "Mark Taylor" <mtaylo1@ect.enron.com> 10/21 11:34 AM >>>


This issue comes up when the Credit Group is not happy with the credit
provisions built into the already executed Master Agreement - they want the
ability to use the GTC with the credit provisions that allow us to call for a
letter of credit whenever we want to instead of having the online trade 
governed
by the master (as provided for automatically in the ETA).  What do you think
about Edmund's solution?

Subject:  Online Trading - GTC/Master variation

Dear Jeff and Mark,

Justin and I have been discussing the way we should approach variation of the
ETA in respect of counterparties with whom we have an existing master 
agreement,
but for whom we want to have transactions governed by the applicable GTC for 
the
product in question.

The initial plan was to issue a letter to the counterparty asking it to sign 
and
return a letter agreement which would vary the provision of ETA which states
that a master agreement will govern all transactions.  We have now 
reformulated
our position and drafted a letter (attached below) which will simply be sent 
to
the relevant counterparty, but which will not require it to sign and return 
any
documents.

We believe that this letter will provide for an effective variation of the ETA
by stating that the counterparty's acceptance of the GTC on the EOL system 
will
mean that that GTC will govern transactions, and not the master agreement.  We
do not think that we need to make an explicit reference to the ETA.  Obviously
for this to work, such counterparty will have to be presented with the 'Accept
GTC' button at the usual juncture in the system.

In addition, we thought it best to remove an explantory paragraph stating that
we will be writing to the counterparty at a future date to revise the credit
provisions of the master (the whole reason for having the counterparty accept
the GTC over the master!!).

Obviously we welcome your thoughts on this issue and the attached draft.  I 
also
presume you will need to take a view as to whether varying the ETA in this way
will be effective under New York law.

Best regards,

Edmund.

(2)  Fundamentals of Corporate Finance on  December 2

Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

Transacting  Question 4 - last line "accepted or rejected immediately upon 
receipt by the EnronOnline system" or "accepted or rejected by the 
EnronOnline system immediately upon receipt."  
  Question 5 - similar comment - build in concept of processing immediately 
upon receipt by the system.
  Question 9 - Can the Master User give others Master User privileges or can 
traders within a company view each other's transactions if the Master User 
authorizes it?  If so, deleat Back Office User and substitute "and others 
authorized by your Master User".  If not, is it possible there will be more 
than one Back Office User?  I so, insert (s).

Products  Question 6 - last line "at the best price available on the 
EnronOnline system (if it is within the range you specify)"

Registration  Question 13 - still needs an answer.  Should it also apply to 
trader user ID's & passwords?

Legal   Question 3 - Password Application,not Agreement;  "framework for 
transactions carried out"

Earnings Related Questions - Will these be posted for all to see?  If so, we 
should have a Corp. lawyer look these over (SEC concerns).  These seem more 
appropriate as answers for PR and IR to have ready in case anyone asks. 

You will no doubt recognize that I have exercised the utmost restraint - 
contrary to my every lawerly instinct - in commenting only on provisions that 
were identified as current changes.What was this one about?

Thanks for spelling it out for me.  I WILL be in NYC this weekend and, while 
I have done it before and found it to be all you describe, would enjoy going 
to the parade with you.  As I remember it, the trick to limiting the 
aggravating and full of people factor is deciding where to watch and when to 
be there.   The embarrassment factor is significantly reduced by refusing to 
participate in the actual parade oneself and not knowing any participants (or 
at least not acknowledging them as they pass).  Do you have the time and 
route?  Maybe we can grab a bite to eat somewhere nearby.

As far as getting in the mood goes, try http://www.bviwelcome.com/ (I should 
know how to make that a link but I don't).

I'll definitely bring the cruising guide and a map if I can find it.  None of 
the videos I have is right on point (either the wrong size boat is involved 
or they're too advanced) but I'll bring them along anyway.  I have mixed 
feelings about bringing  Heavy Weather Sailing - I don't want to 
unnecessarily alarm anyone but we do want G to go to the doctor for the 
Transderm Scop patch!

The question, Mark, was did you mean you were in NYC this weekend?  G seemed
to feel something else was meant and I am not one to argue.  This weeked has
the parade in the village, which could be fun, embarrassing or just
aggravating and full of people, but I think I am going for a look-see. So if
you are around and not feeling that you have done it all in the past, then
we should meet up (provided, of course that your email meant that you were
in NYC this w/end) and we can chat some BVI.  It would be nice to see you,
in any event.

Please call  me if you have questions or comments.  

"All FX deals are to be verbally confirmed as soon as possible after the 
trade is executed.   A comment should be written on the deal ticket noting 
who the deal was confirmed with and the date and time.  Once a deal has been 
verbally confirmed, and entered into TAGG, deals with an expiration within 
one week of the trade date should be sent to the file room.  If the deal has 
settlements beyond one week from  the trade date, a confirmation should be 
generated based on the template for that particular counterparty.  All 
intercompany deals should be paper confirmed.  

In the event that we are unable to verbally confirm a transaction by the end 
of trade date + one, a written confirmation should be generated and sent to 
the counterparty.    

Any discrepancies noted when verbally confirming should be brought to the 
traders attention."

Thanks.  LEt me know what you think.

Subject: Australia and EnronOnline

In the build up to bringing Australia onto the EnronOnline system with a 
start date of 1st February 2000, I have outlined a kick off plan as a 
suggestion.

The initial work we have done covers the areas outlined belowbearing mind I 
may have missed a few things out.  In order to kick things off I suggest we 
concentrate on the background areas which predominantly will be run by 
legal.  The teams involved in the project so far include the US and Europe - 
where the jurisdictional issues have all been handled are listed at the 
bottom of this note for information but I am to a certain extent assuming 
that legal is run from the US rather than Europe for Australia (I have left a 
voicemail with Alan Aronowitz to chat it through with him).  I would like 
Mark to co-ordinate the work with David and start off immediately - please 
let me know if there are nay problems with this.  From my group Dave Forster 
and myself will be points of contact at this stage bringing in more resources 
as soon as we get the background things rolling.

But firstly we need an idea of what will be traded in Australia, from our 
discussions I am assuming Power, Coal and Weather - is that right?

Background:
(i)  Due diligence from a regulatory perspective
(ii)  Legal review on the framework of our site in its appropriateness to the 
market .
 (i) Drafting of the password application agreements in line with the market
 (ii) Drafting of the electronic trading agreement in line with the market
(iii)  Redrafting of the GTCs to incorporate language to cover web 
transactions.
(iv)  Complete tax review.

Commodities:
(i)  Review with Traders on the products they are to offer
(ii)  Production of short description of each product for publication on the 
web-site quotes page
(iii) Production of long description to be accessed by clicking on the short 
description
(iv)  Trader training on the Stack Manager
(v)  Trader training on the Product Manager
(vi) Trader/originator  training on the Web-site

Customers:
(i)  Collation of customers to be send a marketing pack including password 
application form
(ii)  Credit to process customers to set up the credit limits per product for 
each customer and the appropriate form of GTC profile to be embedded in the  
system.
(iii)  Tax to approve customer profile 
(iv)  Legal to associate customers with any Master Agreements in place.

Support:
(i) Integration of EOL in risk systems
(ii)  Daily data management of traders/customers
(ii)  Maintenance of system

Technical:  
(i)  Bandwidth - Arshak Sarkissian is apparently rolling out bandwidth at the 
current time between Sydney and Singapore to close the link around the  world 
(ie we loop the world).  Between Houston and Sydney we now have 128k line 
which will be increased (approximately doubling the capacity) -  we will 
fortunately have the experience of EnronOnline going live before then to know 
if that will be enough.  Arshak can get a T1 if required in  approximately 
60/80 days.

In order to kick things off I suggest we concentrate on the background areas 
which predominantly will be run by legal.  The teams involved in the project 
so far include (I have left a voicemail with Alan Aronowitz to chat it 
through with him).  But firstly we need an idea of what will be traded in

28Sep1999 AUSTRALIA: Computers - Power supplier seeks vital spark on net. 
By Mandy Bryan.
e-Strategy

As electricity retailers prepare for deregulation, Ergon Energy chief Kim 
Griffith is looking to the internet for competitive advantage.
Around this time next year, NSW and Victorian consumers will be able to 
choose their own electricity suppliers, ushering in a period of massive 
change for Australia's 30 electricity retailers.
Among them will be Queensland's Ergon Energy, which now services 550,000 
customers and earns 50 per cent of its revenue from the consumer market.
Ergon chief executive Kim Griffith has chosen to make the internet a key part 
of his survival plan as he jostles for mind share.
"There really isn't an established way of doing this because electricity has 
always been a monopoly and suddenly 10 million contestible customers will 
appear in an industry that is probably turning over $10 billion in sales a 
year," he says.
While studies show Australian utilities are lagging behind overseas 
counterparts in moving operations online, Ergon Energy is considered to be at 
the forefront of internet adoption by an Australian utility.
Ergon's website allows customers to connect and disconnect their electricity 
service and submit complaints and enquiries.
"If you look at electricity retail, it is fundamentally an information-based 
business and we will survive based on the information we can gather about 
customers," says Griffith.
He also hopes that by 2001 customers will also be able to pay their bills and 
select from more flexible pricing billing arrangements, as well as buy 
products and services online.
"The internet is an obvious way of doing business because it also allows you 
to increase interaction with customers at an appropriate cost. We are now 
selling a commodity with low margins, so a cost-effective channel to market 
is key."
The $3 to $4 cost of over-the-counter transactions is more than 10 times the 
cost of an internet transaction, Griffith says.
As electricity margins shrink, he says Ergon will increasingly diversify into 
non-electricity and electricity-related services and products.
"We are looking to add value and differentiate in areas other than price. We 
are releasing a number of products into our domestic market related to 
electricity and electricity consumption such as energy-efficient light 
bulbs," he says.
"The next big challenge I've put to my people is to put significant product 
on to the site and to generate real revenue."
But he acknowledges that winning in this market is not as simple as being 
first on the web.
Ergon faces competition not only from traditional electricity retailers but 
also nimble virtual electricity brokers such as Exco Energy (www.exco.com.au) 
and possibly banks and supermarkets. Woolworths, for instance, has flagged an 
interest in electricity retailing.
Yet Griffith believes that these same organisations also present 
opportunities to utilities given the reach of their established customer 
bases.
"If you look at electricity, and particularly the mass market, there really 
isn't a channel to market," Griffith says. "In the future, companies will be 
out there trying to create national brands as well as looking to alliances 
with established brands and channels to markets."
In addition to seeking such alliances, Ergon is building up its own customer 
database to hold and analyse the information it gathers from its website.
"Each time a customer hits our website, we can gather more information and 
continue to build business based on that information."
For the time being, though, the major challenge lies in drawing people to its 
site.
"We are offering a number of freebies on our site to get people used to 
visiting it," he says.
Ergon also has comprehensive educational information on its site relevant to 
the school curriculum which it is building up into a full virtual power 
station tour.
"If we want people to keep visiting, we have to keep increasing the value of 
the site to existing and potential customers," Griffith says.
"There are two groups, the ones that will not want to change suppliers in 
2001 and those that do, and they are the people who will be on board with 
technology."

Awais,

From a Pan-European law perspective, the PAs can be signed and faxed to 
Enron. And when the PA is then signed by Enron, it can be faxed back to the 
customer.  We therefore do not require the original of the PA.  [N.B. But do 
check with Mark Taylor for the position under US law.]

However, some customers may feel more comfortable in having the choice of 
returning the PA by mail instead of by fax - in the light of this, you may 
wish to give them this choice.

Justin a little teaser for you.  Can PA's be faxed in?  I have out 
instructionla copy saying thta Customers should complete the Registration 
form and PA and then either mail or fax to us.  I presume we do not need the 
original signed copy do we?

If so I will need to chnage the text on the registration page.  The 
registration process is up on www.enrononline.com by the way now.  Take a 
look.

I belieev all this text was already approved by legal and so shoudl be Ok.

Subject: More FAQ's

Mark,

I'm not sure how you want to handle changes to the FAQ's going forward from a 
legal approval standpoint. Shall we continue to send you all new 
questions/answers?


In addition to the FAQ's sent to you last week, we also have the following:

1. Is EnronOnline wholesale only, or does it do retail?

EnronOnline is not intended for available to retail customers sales at this 
point time.

2. What kind of technology does EnronOnline use behind the applications?

The EnronOnline system uses various technologies to deliver the final product 
site to your screen. This includes an Oracle database, weblogic servers, 
Macromedia Shockwave, HTML, Java and Secure Socket Layer (SSL), among others.

3. What is the minimum size or price which can be transacted on EnronOnline?

The minimum and maximum size is different for each product and is specified 
by the Enron trader who is responsible for that product.  It may vary from 
time to time.  There are no minimum price levels.
[It strikes me that there are minimum price levels (for sales by Enron) and 
maximum price levels (for purchases).]



Thanks,

Dave

Lucy:

Tana tells me you are looking for some guidance as to which Enron entity 
should be used for booking trading transactions with various counterparties.  
There are a couple of general rules that apply to "normal" trading 
circumstances and I'll spell them out below, but remember that these are not 
hard and fast rules and may go straight out the window when circumstances 
vary (even just a little bit) from "normal."  For example, abnormal 
situations exist where the trading transaction is in connection with another 
transaction with an Enron company (e.g. a financing or equity investment), 
the counterparty has a legally justifiable desire to trade with a certain 
Enron company, the product being traded is only traded by a particular Enron 
company or the counterparty is in a jurisdiction outside the country where we 
are trading (except as spelled out below).  Having said all that, the 
following rules (generally tax driven) can be used as general guidelines:

1. If there is no master agreement in place between the counterparty and an 
Enron company, the trade should be entered into on behalf of the Enron 
company based in the country where the Enron trader is when the trade is 
concluded and, if there is any hope of further trading with the counterparty, 
Credit and Legal should be notified to negotiate a master agreement.  Of 
course, if the counterparty is outside the country where we are trading, 
Legal should be consulted ahead of time (there are some countries where 
derivatives are actually illegal, special procedures must be followed or 
can't be done by us from the U.S.).

2. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and either ENA or 
Enron Canada, and the Enron trader is in the U.S. or Canada, the trade should 
be entered into by the trader on behalf of the Enron company that is party to 
the master agreement.  If the trader is outside of the U.S. or Canada, other 
rules may apply.  

3. If there is a master agreement between the counterparty and ECT 
International (usually only European counterparties), and the Enron trader is 
in the U.S. or the U.K., the trade should be entered into by the trader on 
behalf of ECT International.  Note that there are special considerations if 
the trader is in the U.K. based on U.K. regulatory issues (the trade is 
actually "arranged" by Enron Europe Finance and Trading Ltd. on behalf of ECT 
International).  If such a master exists but the trader is not in the U.S. or 
U.K., the trade should be handed off to a trader located in one of those two 
countries for final negotiation and execution.  It would be a good idea to 
consult with Legal or Tax if this comes up for more specific advice.  

These general rules relate to which Enron entity should be the legal 
counterparty to the transactions.  This doesn't determine where within the 
Enron family the actual risk should ultimately reside.  If we want the risk 
to be in an Enron company other than the Enron counterparty for contractual 
purposes, an intercompany transaction should be booked (probably through RMT) 
to get the risk in the right place.Looks good to me.

Just to re-cap for everyone: 

1)  DOI proposal on oil & gas leasing -- will not be in managers' amendment

2)  Enron's techincal correction on production payments -- is safely in the

3)  Enron's additions/changes on derivatives language -- should be inserted 
at Senator Nickles' behest into the managers' amendment before the bill goes 
to the floor this afternoon...will get confirmation soon.

I'll be in touch shortly with updates.....

Would it work if we picked you up in the USVI?  I know it's possible to fly 
into St. Thomas either directly from New York or through San Juan and you 
could take a ferry to St. John (still part o the USVI) where we could pick 
you up.  It's a bit of a hassle since we have to clear the boat into the US 
and then back to the BVI but I've done it a couple of times before.  The 
timing might be difficult since we can't possibly get the boat to St. John 
before the afternoon of the 22nd.  If you're nervous about sailing into the 
BVI, we could stick around St. John for a few days.  You might check the 
cruising guide & see what it says about the US side of things - places to 
go/anchor, etc.Looks like this one is for me to review.  They will be sending these to all 
of us so that whenever one of us is out, we can let the others know to 
forward these on to whomever is appropriate.  We're supposed to get back to 
them within 24 hours.

Bummer - I had no idea the USVI wasn't considered part of the US - I'm 
assuming when you say "on the way back in" you mean from the USVI to the 
mainland since we could try to arrange things to avoid going back to the BVI 
while you were with us if that made a difference.

I don't have any leads on a possible stand-in, but don't really want one 
either since we've our hearts set on YOU.    Hopefully the lawyer can figure 
out a way to speed things up.  As a last resort, maybe we should check with 
Greg for a replacement since that's who he'll have to bunk with.  You have to 
be reasonably careful about such choices since you will be spending your 
holiday in pretty close contact with them.   It may also be a bit late to 
find transport to that part of the world; any hope of transferring the ticket 
in your name to someone else?

I have just spoken with my lawyer.  Basically, USVI does not work.  I could
be easily "carded" on the way back in.  Apparently, it is well tried and
therefore well patrolled way of entry into the US.

We are going to try and get INS to speed the process, but basically I am in
a difficult position.  I no longer have the first job under which the first
application was submitted, so I cannot call and say I need the travel permit
for business reasons, and although my cheques have been cashed (I think) the
travel permit is delayed somewhere.  I have no news at all on the second
application.

Do you know of anyone that you may want to take along instead?  One or two
spots going....whichever is easiest to fill.

I have 4 tickets to the Thursday, November 18 Rockets vs. Sacramento Kings 
game (7:30 start).  Section 125, Row G.Tana forwarded the following message on to me since she will be out of the 
office for the next week or so. 

We are not familiar with any of these companies or their activities or 
operations.  You might want to check with Kate Cole's office to see what she 
knows.

Ed

Please note that each of the following companies will be a new controller of 
EEFT as a result of the reorg:

Enron Power Trading Limited (UK)
Enron Europe Limited (UK)
Enron Europe LLC (US)
Enron Power Corp (US)
Enron Europe Inc  (US) - the new US holding company.

For each company we will need to find out the following info which will need 
to be notified to SFA:

1. Principal activities

2.  Date and place of incorporation and registered number

3.  Names of directors and their dates of birth

4.  Address of head/principal office and telephone number

5.  Regulatory Authorities or Exchanges in the UK or overseas of which the 
entity is or has been a member.

Most of this info is pretty basic, but I suspect 1 &5 could be slightly 
tricky (for 1 we only need to list the principal activity or activities).

Lin, Kate and Tana: 2 of these entities are UK and 3 US incorporated. I'd be 
very grateful if you would assist Edmund in putting this information 
together. It will need to be filed with SFA (the UK regulator) at the 
beginning of next week.

Many thanks in advance for your assistance

Paul

Subject: Form of ECT Legal Opinion

Mark,

I attach a draft form of internal ECT legal opinion that we are proposing to 
offer SWD, a counterparty with whom we are seeking to enter into a Master 
Swap Agreement. 

The impasse to date had been SWD's unwillingness to agree on the content of 
the external (V&E) legal opinion we were offering.  After considerable 
debate, SWD instead agreed to obtain their own form of external opinion (from 
Linklaters). 

In terms of the ECT legal opinion, the changes shown represent deviations 
from our standard form of opinion (as of August last year).  Would be 
grateful for your views at to whether these would be acceptable from Mark 
Haedicke's point of view, and also taking into account any changes that may 
have occurred in the meantime.  John Thompson (who heads up the Frankfurt 
office) would execute the Master, and I have already arranged for the 
appropriate corporate authorisation from Enron Europe Finance & Trading 
Limited.

One sticking point has been SWD's demand that the opinion given under 
paragraph 4 ("No authorizations, consents, etc.....") should also apply to 
SWD; this would seem unacceptable to me.

[Please note that we intend that Jim Derrick would give a legal opinion 
relating to the Guaranty.]

Regards and thanks

Justin




I will give you a call to discuss.

Sara,

I hope you're doing well.  Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit 
like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by 
Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists 
of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy 
companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My 
understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its 
customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in 
this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited 
people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as 
well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).  Please advise!

Paul, 

The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com 
Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may 
prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting 
activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry 
out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation 
development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity 
ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk 
management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the 
Sweden and Finland.

Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general 
extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition 
of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. 
entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it 
anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic?

Martin







Here's the current forecast for Lenny.  Shouldn't be  a major problem for us 
but I feel for folks scheduled to go down there tomorrow and Thursday.

Bruce - we're still keeping our fingers crossed that your permit will come 
through.  Are you sure you've got the right lawyer working on this?  Seems 
like he ought to be able to shake it loose somehow.  Anything at all we can 
do from here?
The Moorings people asked me to call back tomorrow when they'll have a better 
idea about the storm situation - they canceled all of their charter starts 
for today & tomorrow (no surprise) and she expected Thursday's to cancel 
also.  They still have everything for the weekend scheduled to go out but 
they weren't supposed to confirm any hotel rooms between now and Saturday.  
They were able to confirm a room for you for Sunday the 28th (the day we have 
to bring the boat back).  I'll let you know what happens when I get through 
to them tomorrow.

MarkDavid - We'r trying to get through to you on the phone but can't get across 
the Atlantic.  Can you try calling us?  I'm at 713 - 853-7459 & Jeff is at 
713-853-6911.

ThanksSusan:

This is not urgent, but when you have a minute, please check and see what

wondering in particular if they were part of our survey regarding European

Subject: Two New Continental Swap Deal Concluded

Yesterday we concluded two new short term swap deals with two separate 
Continental counterparties. The details are:

Light Fuel Oil (Rheinscheine) swap with M.V.V, a large German municipality. 
Enron pays floating.
Brent Oil swap with MND, a Czech oil & gas producer. Enron pays fixed. (This 
trade was done under an ISDA Master we have with MND)

Although the volumes in each case are not large, these trades are with 
significant counterparties.

Justin


David - as to your point 2, we have used the "Deemed ISDA" appraoch for 
weather derivatives.  I see no reason we can't do something similar in 
Australia for power.  I've atached an example (but I'm not sure it is 
thefinal version).

Subject: Enron Online

Edmund/Justin, I would appreciate your advice on a few points. 

 I am correct in understanding there can be different versions of the  
Password Agreement and Electronic Trading Agreement?  I have seen Password 
Agreement NA Version 1and an Electronic Trading Agreement Version 1 that both 
have Enron North America Corp and/or its affiliates as the Enron contracting 
party.  In Australia we will have to enter into  electricity derivatives 
through the Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd.(EAF)  which is the only Enron 
entity authorised trade in these products. Would EAF also be a party to a 
Password Agreement and ETA with its potential counterparties?
If  I  was starting with a clean sheet in drafting GTCs for Australian 
financial power trades I would incorporate into it the  1992 ISDA Master 
Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)and as well as the 1993 Commodity 
Definitions. This is what Australian counterparties would expect to see. 
However, I notice this approach has not been followed with any of the GTCs I 
have seen. The closest is the incorporation  EFA terms  for the UK power 
contracts. I suppose this raises a general question are there any established 
protocols for drafting GTCs? 
Small point - I notice the limitation of liability clauses in all the 
documentation follows the US form.  I notice even for contracts interpreted 
under English law there is an exclusion of "special damages".  In Australia 
and I thought England special damages were defined money damages that must be 
specially damages as opposed to general damages such as pain and suffering 
that cannot be quantified and are assessed by the court. This is completely 
different  to the meaning of this term in US. Has this issue been considered 
and for whatever reason a decision has been made to go with the US wording?  
How much work have we done on issues such as those relating to formation of 
contracts? I note it was excluded from the scope of your surveys of the 
various European jurisdictions. I am taking my brief to include those issues 
relevant which are material to ensure that Enron is complying with the law 
and will also have enforceable agreement. This may go wider than just 
regulatory compliance issues.


If you prefer give me a call to discuss 612 9229 2310.    

Andrea Calo and Cecilia are not in the system to allow me to add them to your 
review.  Can you ask them to fill out the form and send it on to me (e-mail 
is fine).  The others were in the system and they should be able to fill 
everything out on their computers.

As you are aware, we are in the middle of the VP Performance Review Cycle.  
On instructions from the Office of the Chair,  VP's and above will be

supplemented by two additional indicators:

Providing Feedback to Staff

Critical to the item "Providing Feedback to Staff" is your involvement in 
collecting this data.  Attached is a form that should be distributed to all 
your direct reports regarding this item.  The instructions ask the direct 
reports to send this information back to me.  I will collate the data and 
this will be available for use at both the December ENA Executive Review 
Meeting on December 14, and  the January 5-6 Enron Executive Meeting.  

Again, your involvement in helping me collect this data is critical to the 
success.  Please contact me at Ext 30649 if you have any further questions.  



It does make sense that there shouldn't be a problem with traveling to the 
USVI; since you have to clear immigration to get in there from the BVI I 
wouldn't expect to have to clear again when you go back to the mainland or 
Puerto Rico.  We haven't spent much time sailing in the USVI so it would be 
an exploratory trip for us - not at all a bad thing.  We can't get the boat 
to the USVI till Monday (charter doesn't start till noon on Sun. and there's 
tons of work getting all the food/drinks/ice etc. put away).  Best bet is to 
pick Bruce up in St. John - Charlotte Amalie on St. Thomas is reputed to be a 
large, busy commercial port - a great place for yachts to play dodge-em with 
the cruise ships (not fun).  There is regular ferry service from St. Thomas 
to St. John.  We won't be there before noon on Monday.

I just got off the phone with Greg so hopefully AA can do the right thing 
here!

OK...guys the story is this:


I have just spent the entire day at Federal Plaza with the INS in extremely

Vermont apparently has lost my documents including travel permit and Federal
Plaza cannot step in.  I cannot drive to Vermont, because they only do
postal.  I think I would feel slightly better had I known the outcome at the
start of the day rather than at the end.

Anyway, to cut a long story short, I asked the question of whether I could
goto the US Virgin Islands.  The first answer was "no", so I persisted and
the second answer was "yes; can I point you to the US in the US Virgin
Islands", so feeling very patronised but having achieved something for my
day at Federal Plaza I left.

We now have 3 choices:

1.    Go to US VI......I definitely cannot go to BVI
2.    Delay flight a couple of days and hope that travel permit comes
through (which it should because my lawyer)
3.    Got to USVI and get permit sent on if it comes through

Bruce - I just had another thought (they come so rarely I feel a need to pass 
them along as soon as it happens).  The Full Moon party we discussed before 
is on Nov. 23.  Unfortunately it is in the BVI.  If your lawyer can get the 
permit by Monday and Fed Ex it to us, we could still get over there (Bomba's 
Shack is on the western end of Tortola - reasonably close to the USVI).  The 
boat will have a cell phone but we won't have a number till Sunday at the 
earliest.  Be sure to bring the lawyer's number so we can call him Monday.

Mark

P.S.  -  My sympathies on your day at Federal Plaza.  My imagination isn't up 
to the task of conjuring how miserable that must have been. Yes - and boats.  I wasn't too worried until the last update which indicates 
the storm has lost forward momentum and is just drifting out there - just 
barely east of due south of the BVI.  They are predicting that it will resume 
its course in the morning and I sure hope so but anything can happen.  As of 
the middle of this afternoon, the Moorings was planning to let the Friday 
charter starts go for sure - maybe even tomorrow's!

provide written feedback.  However, you can either call Jim (x3-3354) or set 
up a meeting if you would like to receive verbal feedback.

Thanks,

You have to be careful reading those reports - the 145mph number is the 
current maximum wind speed - right at the eye wall - which is well to the 
south-east of St. Thomas.  The Weather channel this morning showed local 
radar indicating a lot of rain in the US 7 BVI but the storm center was 
pretty far away.  The real question is what direction will it go from here.  
If it heads out to the north east as predicted, no problems.  If it takes a 
turn to the north, direct hit.  I hadn't hard about the state of emergency 
but that could be due to rain related damage.

Many storm sites available:

isory.html
http://www.usatoday.com/weather/huricane/1999/atlantic/wstorm1.htm
http://www.weather.com/weather_center/

In case you need it to decipher some of the coordinates, the BVI is at 
roughly 18 25' N 64 40' W
St. Thomas is closer to 18 20' N 65 W

Check the weather reports.

USVI badly hit by hurricane Lenny....145mph winds......Clinton thinking of
declaring a state of emergency.

B


Interesting damage reports - particularly from St. Croix.  I had been looking 
at the cruising guide when I got home last night to see where we might be 
able to poke around in the USVI.  I seem to remember that the Moorings won't 
let us take the boat to St. Croix (a bit far away) but had thought we might 
want to get special permission.  Now I'm not so sure if the place will still 
be all ahoo when we get there.  It might not have been the entire group's cup 
of tea in any event since it would take a good solid day of sailing each way 
to and from St. John.  My impression is that I might be the only soul on 
board who would relish that thought - particularly if the seas are still a 
bit rough from storm effects.  I'm watching the national Weather Service 
updates as they come out - roughly every two hours.

Caution on the Fed Ex package for the doorman - USVI may be the US for INS 
purposes but not for Fed Ex - they require an international waybill for 
deliveries there.  You can have the package sent to their Cruz Bay office to 
be held for pick-up (two day service - guaranteed by 4 pm) or to St. Thomas 
airport (next day service by 2 pm).  I mentioned in a previous note that the 
main harbor in St. Thomas is not really yacht friendly but we could probably 
figure out a way to get in there if that works out best (maybe go into a 
different bay, dinghy ashore and get a cab to the airport).  Fed Ex - (800) 
247-4747

MarkGood News:  Lenny weakening - max. winds down to 130 mph and pressure rising
Bad News:  The darn thing won't get moving - still just drifting a bit to the 
north & east

It's hard to describe which islands we care about on those maps - they're all 
so small they almost don't show up on the maps.  Luckily St. Thomas is to the 
west and a bit north of Lenny's current position

Here is a San Juan radar image that has St. Thomas marked and one of th 
recent forecasted path maps.

Just for your background info, the other reason we use deemed ISDAs on the 
interest rate & currency deals is that the omnibus was really drafted with 
commodity deals in mind.  I'd have to go back and look at it to see if it 
would work at all for an interest rate or currency deal.  Do you think I 
should do that?  Hopefully not or at least not til after 1/1.

With respect to your request for a Deemed ISDA Confirm for the referenced 
counterparty, I checked with Yao, our paper guru, and he said there is no 
special reason or precedence for using the Deemed ISDA confirmations for the 
paper boys (unless maybe if they did a really long-dated trade).  He said we 
could go ahead and use the omnibus.  Just because we hope to sign an ISDA, 
doesn't necessarily mean we use the Deemed ISDA confirmations.  In practice, 
we tend to use the Deemed ISDA's for international counterparties, for the 
interest rate and currency desk (because a lot of their counterparties are 
banks and dealers and more familiar with the ISDA's, unlike our energy 
counterparties).

Call me with any questions...

I just got this update (emphasis added) - these coordinates put the storm 
just a tad south and a good (but not comfortable) bit east of St. Thomas & 
Tortola.  If it stays on this track, things will only improve in the VI.

Subject: Notice to Global Counterparty

I spoke to Mark Dilworth about our discussion re: Global Counterparty being 
notified via e-mail whenever a customer 'signs' an ETA or GTC. Mark seems to 
think that this methodology is rather difficult, and the liklihood of it 
being accomplished anytime soon is LOW.

There is a report that will be generated with each days trading that will 
identify who our Active customers are (meaning a User ID and Password has 
been issued). That report will give us that day's exposure; exposure meaning 
there was activity for that customer, for that day; no exposure meaning there 
was no activity for that customer, for that day. With activity we would know 
that an ETA had been signed, and then you could go in and see that the GTC 
had been signed off (should be simple, as the GTC would match the Product 
Type being traded). This report would identify new customers as they traded, 
but would not identify those customers that sign an ETA and do not do any 
trades.

Mark has agreed that our idea is certainly do-able for Phase 2.

My only concern is that the letter may not adequately tie the master 
agreement referred to and the products affected in a situation where we have 
more than one master (covering different commodities or transaction types) 
with the same counterparty.  I can imagine a situation where Credit doesn't 
want us to use a physical master but the financial master is ok or vice 
versa.  I mentioned this to Bob and he will watch for situations where Credit 
is only "turning off" one master in a multiple master setting.  We should 
also be listing each master affected if Credit wants to turn them all off.Is this something you know anything about?

From a financial trading perspective, the Credit Group is reviewing each 
potential counterparty and will not approve any counterparty that is not an 
"Eligible Swap Participant" (as defined in federal regulations as over a 
certain size) from trading derivatives.  Generally speaking, they don't 
approve customers that are smaller than that for any trading from a credit 
perspective but that is up to them.

Subject: Sen. Agriculture Hearing on OTC derivatives/CFTC

The Senate Agriculture Committee on Wednesday, December 16 held a hearing on 
OTC Derivatives and the almost-demise of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) 
hedge fund.

Witnesses included:

Panel One:  CFTC Commissioners
Brooksley Born, Chair
John Tull
Barbara Holum
David Spears
James Newsome

Panel Two:  Presidents Working Group on Financial Markets, Staff
Roger Anderson, Treasury
Patrick Parkinson, Fed
Richard Lindsey, SEC
Daniel Waldman, CFTC

Panel Three:  Former CFTC Chairs
Susan Phillips
Wendy Gramm
William Albrecht
Martin Mayer

The only members of the Committee present were Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN) 
and Ranking Member Tom Harkin (D-IA).  Thad Cochran (R-MS) stayed only to 
make a brief opening statement.

In his opening statement, Lugar announced that the Committee would hold 
hearings and "seminars" in 1999 on OTC Derivatives issues as part of 
Commodity Exchange Act re-authorization.  Lugar also announced that he would 
be releasing a set of questions for the Committee to consider in advance of 
next year's hearing.  (I will forward the questions as soon as I am able to 
obtain a copy from the Committee.)

CFTC PANEL:

1)  Chairperson Born - her testimony was essentially no different than what 
she's been saying since May when the Concept Release was published.  She 
focused her testimony mostly on the LTCM meltdown and did not really speak to 
the issue of the appropriateness of derivatives regulation by the CFTC.  She 
only continued to assert that the Concept Release raised necessary questions 
about the OTC market, and its issuance does not officially mean the CFTC will 
regulate, but was completely justified and did not cause legal uncertainty or 
risk in OTC markets.   

She said that the LTCM situation arose because of the use of derivatives in 
"highly speculative" activities.  LTCM had excessive margin obligations to 
futures exchanges, derivatives positions of $1.25 trillion (1000 times its 
capital), and carried excessive debt.   Born said that the Concept Release 
raises questions that go to the heart of the LTCM problem:  lack of 
transparency, excessive leverage, and (most notably) the lack of controls and 
reporting requirements that allow firms to take positions that jeopardise 
markets and avoid appropriate regulation.

She indicated a hope that the President's Working Group would complete its 
studies on OTC derivatives and on hedge funds early in 1999, and that the 
CFTC would work closely with other agencies toward that end.

2)  Commissioner Tull - echoed Born's testimony, saying that the LTCM 
situation raises questions about transparency, leverage, over-lending, 
disclosure, and systemic risk.  He said the Concept Release questions don't 
mean that regulation is required -- the responses will be important to the 
CFTC in dealing with situations like LTCM.

3)  Commissioner Holum - indicated that the CFTC should definitely not act 
until the President's Working Group (PWG) completes its studies on 
derivatives and hedge funds AND until Congress has evaluated the results of 
those studies and considered the issue fully in CEA re-authorization 
hearings.  She said CEA legislation is the appropriate forum for 
re-examination of OTC regulation.  She added that regulators shouldn't be 
able to hide behind interpretations of static old regulation, regulations 
must evolve with the markets.

Holum said the LTCM situation occurred due to excessive leverage, arising 
from a bad investment strategy and over-extension of credit by lenders.  The 
CFTC should not jump to regulation because of one firm's poor management, 
this could drive business offshore.   She also said that regulation of 
on-exchange markets should be examined along with OTC markets.

4)  Commissioner Spears - said that while the Concept Release was purported 
to be a "fact-finding" exercise, it shouldn't have been done in a "vacuum" 
without participation from the rest of the PWG agencies.  Congress should 
have a major role in the debate -- as such Spears and Commissioner Newsome 
have formally indicated that they will not vote for any new regulation until 
Congress has considered that matter, at least through September 1999.

5)  Commissioner Newsome -  he echoed Spears' remarks, saying that he 
wouldn't vote for any new regulation of OTC markets until Congress has fully 
considered the matter and the PWG has concluded its review and studies.  
(NOTE:  I had a chance to talk to Commissioner Newsome after the hearing, and 
he indicated that he would like to take Mark Haedicke up on his offer to 
visit the Enron Trading Floor.)

Questions and Answers:

-- Lugar indicated that the CFTC had information about LTCM's problems well 
before the September collapse (this was reported in the Washington Post).  He 
asked why they did not share this information with the PWG agencies or act 
sooner.  Born responded that LTCM (as a Commodity Pooling Organization - CPO) 
filed audited financial statements and satisfied all reporting requirements 
in filing the information that the CFTC received before September.  She said 
the commissioners never saw the information -- staff determined LTCM was OK 
at that point.  She also said other agencies had some of the same information 
at the same time.

--  Harkin asked the size of the OTC market -- his point being that it is 
unknown due to lack of transparency.  All commissioners indicated they had no 
formal answer, but the guess was around $30 trillion.   Harkin asked if there 
was double-counting going on based on the underlying assets on which 
derivatives are formed.  Born responded that there is not even necessarily an 
underlying asset involved, but yes, there could be multiple-counting.  
Harkin's comment was that this seemed to him like a "pyramid scheme," and 
raises serious questions about safety and soundness.  Harking then asked Born 
if imposing reporting requirements were within the CFTC's exemptive authority 
under the 1993 CEA?  Born replied simply, yes.

-- Lugar asked what expertise the CFTC has in analyzing the OTC market.  Born 
indicated that CFTC economists and attorneys "try to keep up with" OTC 
developments, but don't devote a lot of resources in that area because they 
have made so many exemptions for the OTC market.

PWG PANEL:

Testimony of all witnesses focused mainly on the relevance of the LTCM 
collapse in their two studies on derivatives and hedge funds.  They all 
indicated that the PWG was using a consensus process in their review -- no 
agency's view will be allowed to dominate the studies.  They also stressed 
the importance of looking at OTC markets as international markets, and 
coordinating with international regulatory bodies.

FORMER CFTC CHAIRS PANEL:

1)  Susan Phillips - Said that financial derivatives are easier to regulate 
than commodity derivatives.  (Note:  She seemed to assume in her testimony 
that the main participants in OTC markets were banks and financial services 
firms)  She said that the CEA gives the CFTC very broad authority to 
regulate, and Congress may want to take a fresh look at this.  She also said 
that, in addition to greater market discipline, the best way to deal with 
"unregulated" participants in OTC markets would be more adequate disclosure 
requirements.

2)  Wendy Gramm - was a superstar witness, advocating no further role for the 
CFTC or any other agency in OTC market regulation.  She said that by the 
CFTC's merely asking questions in 1987, the commodity swap market moved 
overseas and did not return until the CFTC issued more friendly policy 
statement and clarifications.  She introduced 2 articles into the record, one 
that focuses on the CFTC's creating legal uncertainty by asking questions 
about OTC markets, and another that says that regulators shouldn't use events 
such as LTCM to advance their own regulatory agenda.  She said that any 
purported regulations need strict review by Congress and cost/benefit 
analysis.

3)  William Albrecht - said there is no role for the CFTC in OTC markets.  He 
said that the CFTC shouldn't use the LTCM situation to stretch its regulatory 
authority to hedge funds.  He reluctantly proposed that the CFTC and SEC be 
merged, because functional regulation no longer appears to work well due to 
diversity of participants in the financial markets.

4)  Martin Mayer - said the CFTC should re-assert its role in derivatives 
regulation due to the recent LTCM situation.  He believes that any financial 
instrument that is a "bet" is a derivative - futures included.

Questions and Answers:

Chairman Lugar asked if OTC market regulation by the CFTC is appropriate.  
-- Phillips replied No, there may be a need for additional disclosure 
requirements, and may be an expanded role for the SEC in doing so.
-- Gramm replied No, and there is no need for nay expanded regulation -- the 
authority should not move to another agency, institutional regulation is 
sufficient.
-- Albrecht replied No, it is too complex and difficult to structure 
functional regulation of derivatives under the CEA.
-- Mayer replied Yes.

Hi Bruce!

Ted took his first steps back to solid foods on Monday night.  He was so sick 
when we left you on Saturday that we had to motor the whole way back to 
Tortola and put him ashore for Saturday night.  We made our flight on Sunday 
and he went to the Dr. on Monday.  They think it was probably food poisoning 
but I don't see why nobody else got it.

Greg's expenses should certainly be part of the common fund.  There were a 
few other common expenses we haven't settled up on yet - Ted had a few 
groceries and a dinner and I paid for the beverage order).  I'll get Ted's 
numbers when I get home tonight and do a tally which I can send tomorrow.  
Let me know if you think of anything else.

When I first get back I usually feel the room swaying when it is small and 
enclosed (like an interior conference room or the shower).  It's a sure sign 
you were acclimatised to the boat!I'm not sure which e-mail address you are using so I figured I'd send to both.

Here is my itinerary for Christmas travel:

11:20 am
Sunday 12/26  Continentat 4122  Leaves Cincinnati 5:45 pm  Arrives Houston

These are Continental Express flights - I don't know if that makes a 
difference in terminals in Cincinnati or not - it does in Houston.

Enron rings opening bell for bandwidth
     exchange 
     By Corey Grice
     Staff Writer, CNET News.com
     December 2, 1999, 5:40 p.m. PT 

     The opening bell has rung for a new kind of exchange. The currency? 
Bandwidth. 

     A subsidiary of energy industry giant Enron, Enron Communications, today 
opened the
     doors to a bandwidth commodity exchange. The company first announced its 
intention to
     sell space on high-speed networks as a commodity in May. 

                            Traditional commodity exchanges sell goods like 
oil, natural
                            gas and grain. Enron has taken this concept and 
given it a
                            telecommunications spin, offering space on 
high-speed
                            networks to communications carriers.

                            In the past, carriers looking to fill holes or 
service gaps in
                            their networks would have had to enter long-term 
contracts
                            with other carriers to fulfill their bandwidth 
needs. The
                            exchange, Enron says, acts as a sort of middleman 
for
                            carriers to find short-term contracts or quick 
fixes as they
                            complete network construction or try to manage
                            heavier-than-expected network traffic. 

                            For example, Global Crossing plans to sell 
capacity on a
                            high-speed fiber optic link between New York and 
Los
                            Angeles over the exchange.

     Enron also expects to start an international bandwidth trading market 
next May.

     Separately, RateXchange, a similar bandwidth exchange, demonstrated its 
own
     commodities trading system at a telecommunications conference in New 
York today. 

     RateXchange predicts that the trading of bandwidth and other 
telecommunications products
     could become a $8 billion market by 2002. A couple more to print, please.

Please find attached redrafts of the swap confirm and swap schedule,
with changes marked from the last drafts.

Please note that Enron's obligations to pay principal under the swap
should terminate in the event of a transfer to a third party under section
5.05 of the sale and option agreement before the expiry of the option
period. This is because the third party will not be obliged to swap the
proceeds of sale it receives from PR-C in the event that the option is
exercised. See section 3.3 of the schedule.

Also, the definition of Payments Received may need to be changed once
the flow of funds in the indenture and trust agreement have been
finalized.

Please call me on 214 659 4403 if you have any questions.

Mark -- thanks very much for the attached draft agreement.  This is fine and
I'll have it signed by J. Aron and faxed to your attention.

I've researched the documentation that is in place between Aron and Enron.
While we do have a master swap agreement between J. Aron and Enron North
America (or its predecessor) I don't seem to show a master physical
agreement.  Accordingly, I believe the transactions would be subject to
Enron's GT&Cs.  I think we would want to modify these in certain respects
(for example, by making the right to call for collateral mutual).  I'm not
sure if we are going to be issuing paper confirmations in connection with
our online activities, but that would be one place to address it.  Best
regards, Steve

Sorry we've been out of touch lately.  We were on vacation (sailing in the 
Virgin Islands) the week of Thanksgiving and were pretty busy getting ready 
for it the week or two before that.  There was a big swim meet in San Antonio 
last weekend that T wanted to see so we drove out for that (yawn).

I didn't even know you were leaving BA!  I knew you had been sort of looking 
around for a while but didn't realize you had made a decision.  What's the 
story?

We're planning to have people over (it's the egg nog time of year) on the 
18th - I'm guessing 8 - 10 pm but we'll let you know the details.Sorry for the delay on getting back to you - looks good to me.

Dear Dave,

Justin and I have had another look at the website and noticed that the old 
Legal & Privacy statement is the one being shown.  The additional language in 
the mark-up below needs to be added before European counterparties access the 
site to trade.

In respect of Finland, we have been in contact with our Finnish legal 
advisers and hope to have the issue resolved (hopefully favourably) today.

Thanks, Edmund.

Dave,

I've now been given access to the Online system, and I've also seen the 
website - it's all looking pretty good.  However, I noticed on reading 
through the Legal & Privacy statement that there is some text missing!! I've 
attached a mark-up showing the missing text (red and bold) which needs to be 
in there.

Regards, Edmund.







Your understanding is correct - the trades are binding on the legal entity 
holding the user id and password.  Any trades done which either the 
counterparty or we want to be with a different entity should be assigned 
pursuant to a written assignment agreement.  If the counterparty continues to 
misuse the system, maybe we should deny access to the types of products 
particular entities are not "supposed" to trade.

My understanding ( as of last week) was that trades done Online were binding 
to the counterparty holding the ID under which the trade was transacted, and 
that confirms (if needed) would we done in that name. A follow up procedure 
was discussed for written assignment to the "correct" counterparty.  This was 
not the case yesterday, where the deal was changed internally to the 
"correct" counterparty without a written assignment.

Mark, Jeff, please comment on the the legal aspects of doing these moves 
internally without a written assignment. Does a verbal OK from each 
counterparty (assignor and assignee)  suffice?

Thanks,

Debbie

We need to know what the resolution plan is to getting Aquilia straight for 
trading Physical and Financial products.   Today we saw Aquilia Risk trade 
Next Day Physical Gas again and we were asked to move the deal to Aquilia 
Energy.  What is being done to get Aquilia Risk from continuing to enter 
Physical trades on line?  My concern for this trade was that we brought it to 
Credit's attention this morning and did not get final word to move the deal 
to Aquilia Energy until late in the day (4.45pm) which affects Logistics 
ability to nominate for next day business.  Logistics has been made aware of 
the late nom and will be working with the Pipe to get the nom in.  If there 
are issues with this late nom from the pipeline we will let you know.

I'm not comfortable with the internal process of  counterparty name changing 
of EOL deals and would like to get comfortable with how we are going to set 
this process up.  I think there should be legal review of all deals that we 
change and would suspect that some form of communication would need to be 
conveyed to the counterparty.

I have talked to Aquilla on several occasions (including today) and they 
continue to say they are capable of playing by the rules.  I will talk to 
them again tomorrow and suggest that we shut off their capability to trade 
physical gas online (and vica versa for Aquila Energy Marketing).  They have 
asked us not to do this however I believe it may be time to revisit this.  We 
do have the legal ability to hold them to their click deals however they do 
not have the contracts to manage physical gas. This would obviously make a 
messy situation.  I suggest that you call Jennifer Denny, Torrey Moorer or 
myself as soon as you see one of these transactions in the future as we can 
check into it immediately.  

All transactions that have occured will be assigned by Aquila to Aquila.  
Mark Taylor will draft the agreements and Aquila has agreed to this.

Tanya and Mark,

We're starting to talk to some resorts about doing weather deals and I wanted 
to give you guys a heads up.
We don't have a structure in place and don't have financials yet; we should 
be getting them sometime this week. 
But, we would like to start sending the ISDA documents so that they can get 
comfortable with them.

Mark: Please send the docs to Dick Deutch,  his number is 314.432.4000. 

Details:
North Peak Resort
10920 Schuetz Road
St. Louis, MO  63146

We're thinking about doing a 1,3 or 5 year deal.  We've already mentioned the 
letter of credit to them.  
The deal might be done on the event of temperature hitting below 28-30 
degrees.  
Please call me if you have any questions.

Best Regards,

Lucy

Hi Marc!

Yes, we're having a few friends over Sat. night for "Holiday Cheer" which at 
our house means cocktails by the Christmas tree and maybe some of my 
wonderful-tasting but horrible-for-you egg nog.  We'd love to see you guys.  
It's just an 8 to 10 kind of thing so even if you have other parties to go 
to, you could make this one the kick-off.

The extent of FABULOUS in our Y2K plans is in the price of the bottle of 
champagne we're going to share at home that night.  I asked T if we should 
plan anything and got the "quiet night at home" reply.  That, of course, will 
change to "Why didn't you plan anything?!" around 12/29 or 30.

How's BMC?  What are you doing for them?  Do you know Clayton Williams?  I 
think he still works there.

Give us a call so we can catch up.  Tell G we said hi & hope to see you 
Saturday!Looks good to me.Any chance of getting the confirms to say "Ashland Inc. through its Ashland 
Specialty Chemicals Comapny division"?

Subject: Project Blackbird Total Return Swap


Some of these are not final.
I would like to consider some counterparty-specific agreement to solve this 
problem.  What do you think of a side agreement among both KN entities and 
Enron which specifies that a user ID and password have been issued to both of 
KN's legal entities jointly and severally and that transactions for certain 
products (e.g. all financial products) entered into under that user ID and 
password will be deemed executed by KN Trading (their financial trading 
entity) and all others will be deemed executed by KN Marketing (their 
physical entity)?  Do you see any problems here?  Issues re: joint & several 
liability under the ETA but not the Transactions?

Let me know if you need further clarification of the problem.

I haven't run this by Louise yet - she may raise system or commercial 
objections.

Subject: Assignment Issue

We continue to struggle with the issue of counterparties trading under the 
wrong name.

KN Trading typically does financial trades, KN Marketing typically does 
physical trading.  We issued seperate ID's to accomadate this however they 
have traded physical this am with KN Trading.  I discussed this with KN 
(Shawn Magovern) and he expressed great frustration with the idea of running 
seperate machines or web sessions.  Shawn asked us to consider what options 
might be available downstream.  His comment was that they will just have to 
turn the system off and that brokers understand their business and apply the 
company name appropriately.   I explained to Shawn that he can control the 
access of his traders and avoid issues in the future however it does require 
them to transact under the appropriate ID.  

Can we develop some form of agreement that would allow us to "automatically" 
assign transaction according to some strict guidelines (I know this is like a 
Power of Attorney)?  Can we look at systematic enhancements in the future 
which would allow for contractual arrangements based on the product?

I would like to get back with Shawn if we can suggest any other options.
My comments are marked below in red.

The Index for a calendar day shall be the average of the Common High and 
Common Low prices published for such calendar day under the heading "Daily 
Price Survey" in the Permian Basin Area: Tex intras, Waha area section of Gas 
Daily, or if a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price for such

Should the word "area" after "Waha" be capitalized?
On some Gas Daily products we are switching to the Gas Daily posted average - 
is this one of those?  Bob Bowen has been looking into this also.








Same "calendar day" comment on the Gas Daily index.  "Succeeding" should have 
two c's.

On the Nymex index, what are we taking the "unweighed average" of?  This 
isn't clear to me.  Should "la" towards the end be capitalized?

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  I never did come up with a good 
solution last year to the "cat climbing the Christmas tree" problem except 
fastening the glass ornaments really tight so when she climbed up inside the 
tree they didn't shake off.  This year she seems content to just hide 
underneath the tree and hasn't been climbing up inside it - maybe she's just 
gotten too big.  I agree that the mouse traps sound mean - what about 
double-sided tape?  I understand the cats hate stepping on the sticky stuff 
so will leave the area alone afterwards (this was suggested as a 
discouragement to jumping on kitchen countertops but might work under the 
tree).  And of course, the lower branches of the tree are reserved for wooden 
and metal ornaments - nothing breakable.

Christmas is coming again, and in reviewing our mail, I came across your
"problem".  Did you come up with any solution?? A friend of ours (non-cat
owner) suggested putting mouse traps under the tree - a couple of paw snaps
and maybe no more??  Sounded cruel to me, especially for my oldest cat (13
years).
     We have used pepper in some cases in the garden, but in the house, this
would probably be more damaging to the humans than our 4 footed friends :-)
     If you have had any luck last year, please let us know, and we can post
it on our web page which we are revising.  Others would find it interesting
and perhaps amusing as well.
     Looking forward to seeing you again this Christmas,

of the transaction via verbal agreement with counterparty. 

Trader: Patrice Mims-Thurston 


Trader: Geof Storrey


Until we have determined a legal structure that works for this trading (e.g. 
Chinese walls, public vs. private reference credits, etc.) I would encourage 
caution in how far you go with specific names.  Once they are tainted, it may

As many of you already know, we have officially embarked on building a 
commercial credit trading business based in Europe but globally focused with 
trading operations in London and Houston.  We are focused on externally 
launching the business by making two way prices on approximately 200 energy 
credits in the US, Canada, UK and Nordic markets by 24 Jan. 2000 but we 
expect to scale up the number of reference credits that we quote on very 
quickly.  The initial names have been selected and provided to the credit 
department in both locations for initial review and will be subsequently

settlement 
prices for the prompt month NYMEX West Texas Intermediate Light, Sweet, Crude

New:

The Index for a Determination Period shall be the arithmetic average of the 
daily

Sweet, 
Crude Oil futures contract for each NYMEX trading day of such Determination 
Period.



Please run these changes past legal before proceeding. When your changes are

Subject: Re: Aquila Risk/Energy Marketing Profile Changes  

We have not restricted access at this point given the request came from 
Aquila contracts and credit.  Aquila can restrict themselves via the 
administration function should the elect to.  This will mean that Aquila's 
contract and credit people will need to talk to their commercial people. 
Debbie Brackett requested collateral on all financial trades done by Aquila 
Energy Marketing.  This prompted Aquilla's credit to say they would stop 
trading as such.  Aquilla's traders feel we should provide an alternative 
solution.    The contractual solution we have proposed will resolve the 
contractual issues however it does not fix the intraday credit issue.  EOL 
will not apply the trades to the correct headroom number when doing the 
credit look prior to the completion of a transaction.

We need to evaluate if there is a systematic solution which can afford to 
give the customer what they want and cover all the credit bases.  The 
solution would have  the system compare the ID and the product and then 
allocates the trade to the appropriate company for both contractual and 
headroom purposes.

For now we will continue to assign trades between companies and credit will 
continue to request collateral as appropriate.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Subject: Aquila Risk/Energy Marketing Profile Changes

Bob,

Is this the latest on Aquila?

Is this still an issue for KN?

I note that the Aquila contacts requesting a profile change are Contracts and 
Credit - have we spoken to the traders? I'm not comfortable that limiting the 
profiles provides the best solution for the customer - bearing in mind that 
our primary customer is the trader, who will be the one actively using EOL.

I'm also not real happy about restricting a customer's profile - although I 
realise that we have done so for Power (license issue) and we do so for 
credit purposes. More importantly, though, we are talking about restricting a 
customer's profile to make it harder for an actively trading counterparty 
(valid or not) to be doing trades.

To my way of thinking, we need a solution which encourages the traders to 
trade without annoying other elements in Aquila to the point where they pull 
access to EnronOnline - which brings me back to the assignment solution, 
hairy though it may be.

Thoughts?

Aquila and others continue to transact under the wrong company (ie physical 
under the financial company and financial under the physical company).  I 
have had several conversations with them concerning this however, they have 
requested that we provide som sort of legal framework which will allow them 
to transact under one ID for seperate companies.  Mark has discussed this 
with outside counsel and are comfortable with such an arrangement.  
Essentially the document would state that physical transactions done under ID 
XXXXXXX will be with Aquila Energy Marketing and financial transactions done 
under ID XXXXXXXX will be with Aquila Risk Management.  

Please let me know if we can proceed with this type of document.  The only 
other alternatives at this point are to 1.) assign transacations as they are 
completed 2.) remove execute rights according to the company.

 


Let me check with Mr. B.  I don't think we have any specific plans - probably 
last minute shopping/wrapping.  We're both leaving on Thurs. and returning on 
Sun.Mark H. has asked me to prepare an outline of an "acceptable" regulatory 
framework for OTC energy derivatives that we could use as a fallback position 
next year.  Here is a draft I've come up with.  Any suggestions?
Friday at 10 looks good to us.

Steve Kim has been working with me in Houston where one of his roles is 
PULPEX trading on a day-to-day basis.  He will be moving to London in late 
January to assist in our European marketing efforts.  I would like him to be

a back-up when no one is available in the US.  I have spoken with PULPEX 
about this and their legal department wants us to organize it where:

 Enron Europe would be a member of the exchange
 There would be a give-up agreement between ECTRIC and ENA where trades 
executed by Europe would automatically be transferred into ENA's 
  accounts

The exchange thinks this should be easy to set up from a legal perspective 
and Derick Oliver at 171 815 8502 to initiate the necessary docs.  Please let

Thanks for your message.  Apparently, EEFT is the Member of IPE as a 
principal - but always acts through brokers when placing orders for ECTRIC 
(i.e., never places orders itself on the Exchange).  I'm not sure that Bob 
would want to have Steve place orders through brokers for ECTRIC rather than 
being able to trade on the Exchange himself.  I'll know more once I chat to 
the Exchange about the potential ways forward.

I did havea brief conversation with Janice about this but don't remember her 
conclusions.  For financial transactions we are attaching the GTC's.  That is 
the way we handle the regular telephone trading and in an attempt to make the 
online trading look as much like telephone trading as possible we continue 
the tradition.  If in current liquids trading the terms and conditions are 
not sent as part of the confirm (where there is no master in place) I don't 
know why we need to attach them for online trading.  If the back office needs 
a Word version of the GTC to make their job easier there should be no problem 
getting one for them.

You will recall that we went to a meeting last month w/ the EOL people while 
you were out of town.  That meeting revealed that a lot of work still needed 
to be done on the confirms.  Of course, there still hasn't been time to 
finish the liquids products EOL confirm templates, and I think the priority 
got less urgent, since these products will be among the last to be traded by 
EOL.  But the quesiton lingers about the need to attach GTCs to each confirm 
that's sent out to the EOL counterparty.  It seemed to us that perhaps you 
and Mark Taylor and others might have had discussions on that topic ahnd 
reached some conclusion.  Rob Cass made a rather cogent appeal that we not 
require the attachment (lots of manhours, for one reason, since the computer 
will not automatically generate the GTCs or autofax them).  But we never had 
a chance to talk about this, so I'm wondering if you could give me your 
thoughts.  Thanks.

By the way, it looks like the SK deal closing is on for next week, so I'll be

The last 5 are "at-large" members of the council.  I got all of these from 
the City web site so I can't be sure it's a current list.

Another argument for two lanes on Heights is that with only one lane, some 
percentage of traffic will divert itself to side streets making them less 
safe for residents there.

And p.s. the argument that this lane is designed for use by bicycle commuters 
is particularly empty since the lane doesn't go anywhere - there's no 
connecting route at either end that I am aware of - do they expect all these 
hypothetical bicycle commuters to get on I 10?There are conflicts for the 2:00 time slot and so many year-end deals taking 
up everyone's time and attention that I think it makes sense to reschedule 
for a later date.

Mark, would it would it be possible to move the meeting to 2 PM Houston time 
today?  If there are schedule conflicts or if a room is not available then 
perhaps we can reschedule it for after the Holidays.

I agree completely, have talked to the Mayors Office - Citizens' Assistance

and have written to Ms. Dorsey.  I suggest you also complain to our City 
Council member and the other at-large members.  Since Dorsey is the Bikeway 
Coordinator, she won't have much incentive to do away with a designated 
bikeway but Council members want our votes:

   I spoke to her and found out that this has been planned since the

   has received several complaints but the project will continue until
   completion (they have to put down the bike symbols) before it would

Mark:

Happy new year. I hope your new year was eventful on the personal side and
uneventful on the business side.

As you will have seen from my e-mail earlier this week, we are very close to
final on the Supplement. We just have a couple of firms to hear from and we
are chasing them down. One of those is Enron, which you recall took on the
responsibility for the various commodities that no one else volunteered for
(benzene & methanol). Can you check up on the status of the review?

Thanks.

Subject: 1999 Supplement to the 1993 Commodity Derivatives Definitions



Responses to our request for a final review of the 1999 Supplement have been
very good. We are still waiting on a couple of responses. I won't name
names. You know who you are.

Please also review the attached e-mail from Patricia Hogan at Goldman Sachs
regarding the appropriate Platt's references. She suggests that the Platt's
reference in each definition should be to the version of Platt's that is
published in the relevant region. Please let me know as soon as possible
whether you agree with her suggestion. If you agree with her suggestion,
which I believe is largely mechanical, I would ask that those who took
responsiblity for a particular commodity let us know the proper Platt's
reference for the commodity and delivery point. Otherwise, we will assume
that Tricia's suggestions should be followed.

I look forward to wrapping up this project in the next ten days, so please
respond promptly.

 We have reviewed the Reference Price Sources for the commodities
that have been assigned to us.  I will forward our changes, amendments and
updates under separate cover.

 In the course of reviewing the Price Sources, we came across one
issue that was not discussed on the recent conference call, but is one about
which we have strong feelings.  We believe that the Price Source used for a
particular commodity should reflect the geographic source of the commodity,
e.g., Platt's Asia-Pacific for Asian commodities, Platt's European,
Marketscan or Platt's Crude Marketwire for European commodities and Platt's
Oilgram for North American commodities.  While reviewing the Reference Price
Sources for Fuel Oil, we found that in many cases only Platt's Oilgram is
listed, even though the product is European or Asian.  We would prefer to
delete the references to Platt's Oilgram for products outside of North
America.  However, we understand that such a step cannot be taken without a
discussion with the wider group (which may not be feasible at this point).
If such a discussion is not feasible, we would like (if possible) to include
the European or Asian-Pacific price source in the Supplement along with the
U.S. price source for all products (including those commodities we have not
reviewed and commented on).

 I apologize for bringing this issue up so late in the process.
Please call me, Keir Prince (011 44 171 774 5004) or Aaron Marcus (357-9514)
if you would like to discuss.

I called and asked for an information packet on the Enron insurance plan (it 
is through MetLife) last week.  I will let you know as soon as it comes.

Thanks for the update on Tim & Sharon.  I guess the down-side of a 2 year old 
is that she may already have a fairly well formed personality, but the 
up-side is they will know she is healthy and she is still young enough to 
learn a new language easily.

Feel free to let me know when the bank statement comes - I seem to remember 
that we came up with a scheme to deal with that last year.  I'll bet we can 
do it again!  And until then we can just bask in the light of this amazing

          Writer Patrick O'Brian Dies at 85


          A.P. INDEXES: TOP STORIES | NEWS | SPORTS | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | 
ENTERTAINMENT 


          Filed at 3:21 p.m. EST

          By The Associated Press

          LONDON (AP) -- Patrick O'Brian, whose celebrated novels of 19th
          century seafaring won praise from critics and the loyalty of 
legions of
          readers, has died. He was 85. 

          O'Brian died in Dublin, Ireland, where he had been working on a book
          for several weeks at Trinity College. The cause of death was not 
given
          and there were conflicting reports of the date. 

          The British Embassy in Paris said O'Brian died Tuesday, but 
newspapers
          and the news agency Press Association said he died Sunday. O'Brian
          had lived in France since 1949. 

          O'Brian's major work was a 20-volume series set in the Royal Navy
          during the Napoleonic wars. 

          A deep knowledge of naval history and 19th century life enabled him 
to
          evoke a time and place so vividly that, in this era of supersonic 
jets and
          smart bombs, his readers were gripped by the slow-motion suspense of
          sea battles fought under sail. 

          The series, begun in 1969 with ``Master and Commander,'' is the 
story
          of the friendship between a bold and ambitious navy officer, Jack
          Aubrey, and the ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, a naturalist and 
secret
          agent who doesn't much like sailing. 

          Although the books were well-reviewed and found an enthusiastic
          readership from the start, it wasn't until the 1990s that they 
achieved
          wide recognition abroad and were lifted out of the ``historical 
fiction''
          genre in which they generally were reviewed. 

          In 1991, a New York Times critic called O'Brian ``the best novelist 
you
          have never heard of.'' 

          ``Patrick O'Brian has written great and enduring literature which 
happens
          to be set largely at sea,'' the Sunday Telegraph wrote in 1997, 
praising
          ``the intensity of characterization, the complex elegance of the 
plotting,
          and the brilliance of the writing.'' 

          O'Brian also proved that, in the hands of a skilled writer, 
specialist
          language need not be an obstacle to understanding. Readers who can't
          remember which side of a ship is starboard still can feel the 
frantic activity
          on deck as the sails unfurl and catch the wind, and the excitement 
as a
          man-of-war turns to engage the enemy. 

          A lexicon explaining O'Brian's nautical terminology was published, 
but
          O'Brian didn't think definitions important. 

          ``Ignorance of the cross-catharpins is not necessarily fatal,'' he 
once said.
          ``Explanation almost certainly would be.'' 

          O'Brian's fans range from actor Charlton Heston to critic John 
Bayley, a
          former Oxford professor of literature who wrote that O'Brian's
          ``originality consists in the unpretentious use he makes of 
(history) to
          invent a new style of fiction.'' 

          ``No other writer,'' Bayley wrote, ``not even Melville, has 
described the
          whale and the wandering albatross with O'Brian's studious and yet 
lyrical
          accuracy.'' 

          O'Brian guarded his privacy, and in his few interviews resisted 
questions
          about his personal life. 

          He was born Dec. 12, 1914, in Chalfont St. Peter, west of London, 
and
          it wasn't until 1998 that he was revealed to be the son of an 
English
          doctor and not an Irishman as had been widely believed, the Daily
          Telegraph said in an obituary Friday. 

          The newspaper said O'Brian was born Richard Patrick Russ, but
          changed his name in 1945. During his school years, he was 
frequently ill,
          spending much time reading. His writing career began at age 15, 
when he
          published a book about the union of a giant panda and a snow 
leopard. 

          During World War II, O'Brian drove ambulances and worked briefly
          with Britain's Political Intelligence Department. 

          In 1949, he and his second wife, Mary, moved to Collioure, southern
          France. His first seafaring novel was ``The Golden Ocean'' in 1956,
          about a Pacific expedition. 

          O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series was already well under way in 
Britain
          by the beginning of the 1990s, when editor Starling Lawrence of the
          American publisher W.W. Norton chanced to read one on a flight 
home. 

          The rest, as they say, is publishing history. 

          Several years ago, the writer said he would end the series with the 
20th
          book, but last month he said he was working on volume 21, the Daily
          Telegraph reported. 

          O'Brian also wrote biographies of Picasso and naturalist Sir Joseph
          Banks. A linguist, he translated the work of French writers Simone 
de
          Beauvoir and Colette. 

          O'Brian was made a Commander of the Order of British Empire in 1995.

          Funeral plans were not announced. He is survived by a son, Richard,
          from his first marriage. Here is a revised version - let me know what you think.

This will summarize our conversation this morning in which you asked if there 
was a problem with your purchase of an equity investment (through a private 
placement) in an internet/communications company.  My response was that Enron 
prohibits the trading by employees of (i) any security on the Restricted List 
maintained by the Compliance Group, (ii) any security, instrument or 
commodity within that employees area of responsibility and (iii) any energy 
commodity.  I suggested that you contact Donna Lowry to confirm both my 
understanding and that the security in question is not on teh Restricted List.

While I did not mention it on the phone, I should point out that it would be 
unwise to take a position in a competitor of Enron's that would (or might in 
the future) give you control or the appearance of control or influence over 
the management of that competitor.---------------------- Forwarded by Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT on 01/11/2000 09:38

This letter goes a good bit further than we have with any of the North 
American counterparties negotiating the ETA in that it identifies only those 
portions of the ETA that control over the masters rather than identifying 
those provisions which are subject to the masters.  In my view there are 
really only very few places where we do not want the ETA to govern.  Most of 
the agreement relates to the use of the website itself and to that extent 
there either should be no conflict with the master or if, by some tortured 
interpretation there is a conflict, the ETA should control.  In one case I 
had to go through the entire ETA with the counterparty's lawyer, paragraph by 
paragraph, to identify those provisions where we would be willing to allow 
the master to control.  The only sections we had to amend were the first 
sentence of section 3(e) (regarding confirmations - this may be different in 
the UK version), the confidentiality provisions and the notice provisions of 
section 6(e).  And of course nearly every counterparty making comments has 
insisted that the indemnity provisions be scaled back to one extent or 
another.

Maybe if PowerGen is intransigent, they would be willing to add a sentence to 
the letter indicating that the ETA will control regarding the acess to and 
use of the website.  In an attempt to differentiate between our contractual 
trading arrangements and our agreement concerning the use of the website, 
perhaps Paragraph 3(a) can read something like "Except as set forth under 
paragraph 3.(b) and (c) below, in the event of any conflict between the ETA 
and the master agreement, with respect to the terms of any Transactionthe 
master agreement shall prevail.

If we have to use this letter, my only other suggestion to the language would 
be to refer in paragraph numbered 1 to "The agreements listed beloweach
comprises a" or better yet "Each agreement listed below is a" rather than 
"The agreements listed below comprise the".

Subject: PowerGen - Urgent

Dave,

I'm trying to reach agreement with PowerGen re: EOL trades - they are still 
very concerned with the overriding effect of the ETA, and will not accept our 
position.

However, I have managed to get somewhere..........and I attach a draft I 
propose to send to their lawyer.  This is I believe as far as we can get with 
PowerGen (I did speak to him and I don't think he will go any further than as 
set forth in the draft).  The key point for me was to get PowerGen to agree 
(which I think they will) that the short + long descriptions [key elements of 
any trade] prevail over the master.

Thoughts, comments please....

My view - if PowerGen agrees the draft, that should give us sufficient 
comfort...

Thanks

Justin





We need to revise the Counterparty Matrix procedures.  Counterparties with a 
North American financial master agreement should only map to North American 
financial products (including all weather and paper transactions).  
Therefore, please revise the counterparty matrix to reflect that those 
counterparties with a North American master map to GTC's for European 
derivative transactions.  Please call me or Tana if you have any questions.

Thanks!

RESEARCH ALERT - Enron price target raised

NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Schroder & Co Inc said Wednesday it raised Enron
Corp's (NYSE:ENE - news) price target to $75 from $60 and cut 2000 earnings 
per share
estimates.

-- raised price target because ``as the bandwidth trading market unfolds over 
the next 12 months, we anticipate that an
additional $15 of value will be created for shareholders, with considerably 
greater value possible as the market develops.'' 

    -- cut 2000 estimates to $1.45 per share from $1.55 "due to
fine-tuning."
    -- introduced 2001 EPS of $1.75.
    -- "Bandwidth trading will be a critical value creator in

2000. Enron has built a critical base in the emerging bandwidth commodity 
industry, which is poised to achieve rapid growth in
2000."

-- ``Bandwidth trading keys off Enron's market dominant skills developed in 
trading electricity and natural gas. After executing
the first key bandwidth trade in 1999, Enron appears poised to begin posting 
rising transaction volumes, establishing the
credibility of this new industry.''

-- ``The ultimate value of bandwidth trading is likely to exceed the total 
value of Enron's existing electricity and gas franchise.''---------------------- Forwarded by Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT on 01/14/2000 02:21

The only modifications to ECFC's online GTC's are as follows:

Contract Formation In order to maintain consistency with the other product 
lines online GTCs, we've modified this section to reflect the same 
introduction as reflected in ELFI, EGLI, ERAC and EPC.

Damages and Limitation We've added a 2 line bilateral provision regarding 
payment.

Financial Information We've added the two paragraphs re credit provisions as 
reflected in the confirmations.

Compliance with U.S. Laws We've added the buyer/seller trade sanctions as 
reflected in the confirmations.

Law and Jurisdiction We replaced this section in its entirety with the new 
policy in effect as of June 1998.

Appendix II We've added the Marine Provisions Addendum.

Appendix III We've added the Transportation Addendum.

Subject: Credit Trading OnLine - Results of Legal Due Diligence and Risk Memo

NOTE - GIVEN THE PROPOSED LAUNCH DATE OF 24 JANUARY 2000 FOR THIS PRODUCT, 
THIS NOTE IS INTENDED TO SERVE BOTH AS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS OF OUR LEGAL 
DUE DILIGENCE AND AS A RISK MEMO

As you know, we have carried out legal due diligence in the eight countries 
where it was intended the credit product  would initially be traded via 
EnronOnLine - namely, the UK, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway, 
Sweden and Switzerland.  Under the terms of the credit product, on the 
occurrence of  a bankruptcy with respect to a specified third party (the 
Reference Entity) the Seller of the product (which could be either Enron or 
its online counterparty) will pay a fixed, pre-agreed cash sum in an agreed 
currency to the Buyer. (It should be borne in mind that this product differs 
in a number of ways from the more conventional credit derivatives traded in 
the international markets. This means that a change in the nature or terms of 
our product or the introduction of alternative credit products will likely 
change the analysis below.)

Set out below is an overview of where we have come out on the more 
significant legal issues.  I am also attaching a two page "Executive Summary 
of Legal Advice" prepared by outside counsel which highlights the significant 
legal issues/risks in each country and which should be read in conjunction 
with this note mail. As you will see, the Executive Summary does not focus on 
issues we raised which are "all clear" from a legal perspective, so as to 
keep the summary to a sensible length  (but there was plenty of good news 
too!).  Where a legal issue has been identified, I have either set out below 
what action is to be taken, or not addressed it further on the basis that, on 
the advice of foreign counsel, the risk is not very substantial or unlikely 
to materialise. Therefore, where no comment is made below in relation to a 
risk highlighted in the attached summary, please assume that the legal risk 
is one which, in our view, it is reasonable to take.

A.  Countries in which the credit product can be traded in January 2000

 Finland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, US

B.  Countries in which launch of the product via EnronOnline will need to be 
delayed

 Canada, Germany (reasons set out below)

C.  General Issues (applicable in all countries)

The credit product is fundamentally different from the usual energy and 
related products we trade and so gives rise to new or increased legal risks 
of a general nature:

(i)  Capacity - We will not be able to assume generally that our 
counterparties will have the legal power and authority necessary to trade the 
product and so will need to check each counterparty's constitutional 
documents before allowing them to trade the product online.  This applies to 
almost all entities (eg corporates, municipalities, insurance companies) in 
all countries.  Some entities may lack the power to trade under the general 
law (in which case we will not be able to deal with them at all) or under 
their constitutional documents (in which case they will need to amend their 
constitutional documents if they wish to trade).  

The check need only be made once at the beginning of the credit trading 
relationship and so can be added to our procedures.  It is not a particularly 
onerous job and will increase the cost of this business only incrementally.

(ii)  Confidentiality - We will need to put in place procedures to ensure 
that we are not misusing confidential information about our business 
counterparties on whom we are offering credit protection.  Misuse can occur 
both in pricing the product and trading it.  The procedures will not include 
formal Chinese Walls separating the credit traders from our other traders or 
the credit department (a point we have managed to agree with both UK and US 
counsel following very detailed discussions).  The procedures will include 
(a) the use of a Restricted List in both the US and Europe (similar to the 
procedure currently used in Houston); and (b) practical steps to ensure that 
confidential information derived from other areas of our business and which 
we are not entitled to use (eg because it is the subject of a confidentiality 
agreement) is not imparted to the credit traders.  In addition, where Enron 
has an especially close relationship with a prospective reference entity, or 
otherwise has confidential information relating to such an entity, we will 
need its written consent before offering protection on that entity.  Without 
such consent, there will be an unjustifiably high risk of being sued by that 
entity for breach of confidence.

D.  Country Specific Issues

(i)  Canada - There is a substantial risk that the product will constitute 
insurance business, constituting an offence and rendering contracts in the 
product unenforceable against our counterparties.  We should try to resolve 
this issue with the Canadian authorities before launching the product in 
Canada.  Timeframe for clearance is highly uncertain since it is not clear 
which Canadian authority would take jurisdiction of the matter.

(ii)  Germany -  Again the issue is insurance.  The risk is higher than in 
Canada and so Germany should be excluded initially.

(iii)  Norway - There is a material risk that the credit product could be 
regarded as gaming in Norway, in which case trades would be void and 
unenforceable.  The normal way to mitigate this risk in Norway is by using a 
"substantial professional effort" to satisfy ourselves that a trade is being 
entered into for valid commercial purposes (normally hedging) by our 
counterparty. Clearly, it will not be possible to take such steps on a trade 
by trade basis in the context of EnronOnline.  At a minimum, we should 
therefore ensure at the outset of the online trading relationship in this 
product with each Norwegian counterparty that there is a commercial logic 
behind its trading this product type.

(iv)  Switzerland -  If the credit product is the main purpose of our trading 
relationship with a counterparty, we should check with the Swiss supervisory 
authority whether the product constitutes insurance (the position being 
unclear).  If a trade is insurance, it can be terminated by the counterparty 
(which is obviously of greater concern if Enron is the Buyer) and an offence 
will be committed since Enron is not authorised as a Swiss insurer.  However, 
I understand that the initial group of counterparties will be existing 
business relationships, in which case we can parallel path this issue.

(v)  US (New York Law) 

(a) CFTC regulation - by structuring the product either as a swap or an 
option (and meeting certain other conditions) we can rely on exemptions under 
the US Commodities Exchange Act. 

(b)  US securities laws - there is a small chance that the credit product 
constitutes a "security" under US securities laws (please see attached 
Executive Summary).  However, SEC regulations allow the public offering of 
securities to "accredited investors" which will allow us to deal with 
investors having at least US$5 million in assets.  Since most of our 
counterparties will be fairly large, sophisticated players, this test should 
not impede the business.

(c)  Insider trading - US counsel have advised that the risk of insider 
trading occurring as a result of the product being characterised as security 
(see (b) above) is relatively remote.

Subject: Eastern - Summary of their Response to PA/ETA

PA

They wish to amend the PA such that:

Enron warrants that their use of the passwords and the Website does not cause 
them to breach any third party rights Does this mean that Enron's use does 
not violate third party rights or Eastern's?  This doesn't really make sense 
to me:  if it is Enron's use then that's our problem and I don't see 
Eastern's concern and if it is Eastern's use that should be their problem, 
not ours - how will we know what arrangements they have in place with third 
parties?  No one else has raised this issue - is this something that is 
particularly of concern in the UK?
they only notify us of unauthorised disclosure or use of passwords upon their 
learning of the same. When they notify us is not an issue - as long as they 
understand that they will be liable for anything that happens with their 
passwords - whether authorized or not.
they can withdraw or amend information provided to Enron from time to time  
What is there in the PA that would prevent them from telling us about changed 
information?

ETA

They do not want to be bound by future terms and conditions imposed by Enron 
(see 1(iii))  This language refers to a variety of language on the site - 
including things like the submission screen, the Mater User's abilities to 
restrict sub-user id's, the long descriptions, etc.  It is simply not 
possible to create a list of every single item on the website that controls 
how the site is used and contracts are created.  This is one they will just 
have to live with.  They have to give their traders the credit to read what 
they are doing and if they don't like it they can stop trading.   
They wish to restrict our use of information to Enron Group companies (see 
last sentence of 2(b))  I think 2(b) already limits our use of the 
information to "Enron" which is defined pretty much as Enron and its 
affiliates.  Are they asking for more than that?  You can point them to 
section 5 which severely limits what we can do with confidential information. 
They feel unable to make the statement in the first sentence of 2(d), since 
they trade through various group company agents on behalf of a BV principal 
EOL is not set up to allow one entity to trade on behalf of another.  How 
would we ever know who our counterparty really was?  If they want to trade 
for several counterparties, they need to fill out a separate PA (and 
separately click on the ETA) for each legal entity.  They should subsequently 
restrict the sub-user id's for each of those entities to trade only the 
products appropriate to that entity.
To establish a tangible audit trail and for verification, they wish to be 
able to verify our paper confirms (see 3(e))  We have agreed that we will 
continue to furnish confirmations where we have a master agreement in place 
that calls for us to send confirms.  I've had a number of counterparties ask 
for this and have explained that even when there is not a master in place, in 
most cases we intend to continue to send confirms.  In fact, it is our 
intention (and the instructions you and I have received from Louise in no 
uncertain terms) that the trading should look as close as possible to its 
current form.  That includes contractual terms and the sending of confirms.  
Having said all that, the commercial people look forward with fondness to a 
time when confirms will become electronic and therefore this language was put 
in the ETA.  I would be surprised if, should we ever reach such a time, we 
would refuse to send confirms to those counterparties stuck in the dark ages 
of "blue ink on dead trees."  Given the frequency with which this on comes 
up, I wonder if future versions of the ETA should omit the offending 
language.
They wish to restructure the indemnity entirely (see 4), such that each party 
is liable for losses suffered by the other due to its own wilful 
default/negligence/omission.  This strikes me as a non-starter.  The best we 
can do is to exclude damage we suffer by reason of our own gross negligence, 
fraud or willful misconduct.  If they want to be without risk, they can 
continue to use the phone.
They wish to have the right to terminate the ETA (see 6(a)), and wish that 
electronic notices be deemed sent when the sender receives notice from the 
system of delivery or failed delivery (see 6(e)).  They can stop trading at 
any time and do not need to terminate the agreement.  We have agreed on rare 
occasions that we will deactivate their password if we receive written notice 
from them requesting deactivation.  I have suggested that they might feel 
more comfortable giving the Mater User ID and password to someone in their 
control group so that they don't have to worry about the trader leaving and 
taking the important password along.  The Master User can always turn off a 
sub-user immediately.  I'm uncomfortable with the delivery issue since I 
usually don't get "notice from the system of delivery" when I send an 
e-mail.  Even if return receipts were always used, I don't know that they 
always work and I wouldn't want the counterparty to be able to prevent our 
giving notice simply by refusing to open our e-mails.  Certainly no one would 
successfully assert that an e-mail notice was effective unless properly 
addressed.  On the other hand, to be practical, if the issue is critical, we 
will not be relying on an e-mail notification in any event and I can 
understand their concern that someone might be on holiday when the e-mail is 
received - not as big an issue with a fax or letter that can be easily opened 
by someone else.

Some of these are more important than others, but there are some key points.  
Please let me know what you think - thanks

In some cases you just have to wait these guys out.  I know the traders are 
anxious to get people online and trading, but remember that the same is true 
on the other side.  Luckily for us, Louise is willing to back us up on this 
and tell our counterparties to just sit back and watch the rest of the world 
get the good prices if they don't like our agreements.  In several cases, 
counterparties who have called with difficult legal departments like this 
ultimately just went ahead and clicked on the thing to start trading.

Mike Robison and I have finalized the form of GTC's for ECFC and are 
forwarding them to you for further distribution.  Thanks.

 

John - 

The only modifications to ECFC's online GTC's are as follows:

Contract Formation In order to maintain consistency with the other product 
lines online GTCs, we've modified this section to reflect the same 
introduction as reflected in ELFI, EGLI, ERAC and EPC.

Damages and Limitation We've added a 2 line bilateral provision regarding 
payment.

Financial Information We've added the two paragraphs re credit provisions as 
reflected in the confirmations.

Compliance with U.S. Laws We've added the buyer/seller trade sanctions as 
reflected in the confirmations.

Law and Jurisdiction We replaced this section in its entirety with the new 
policy in effect as of June 1998.

Appendix II We've added the Marine Provisions Addendum.

Appendix III We've added the Transportation Addendum.


Thanks.

I have gone ahead and forwarded this and the ECFC version to the EOL people 
to be uploaded.

I do have a concern though that I wanted to ask you about. These GTC's use 
the defined term "Commercial Term" which is defined as follows:

"Commercial Terms" means that part of this Agreement confirming in writing 
the specific terms of a Transaction which may be in any form adequate at law 
that is issued in connection with a Transaction.

We have taken the position in our other EOL trading that the transaction is 
complete and binding from the time we accept the counterparty's offer over 
the system by reference to the GTC, the numbers submitted by the counterparty 
(usually volume and price) and the Long Description.  We've gone to some 
lengths to make sure that the combination of GTC, website numbers and Long 
Description contain all of the necessary terms.  It's not clear to me that we 
intend the website numbers and Long Description to satisfy the definition of 
Commercial Terms.  Are these transactions not intended to be binding until 
the confirmation is signed?  Any thoughts on this?

=09(Enron North America Corp.)
 FROM:=09Kenneth M. Raisler=20

 RE:=09Enron Online/Credit Product

This memorandum summarizes the proposed procedures we discussed during our=
=20
meeting on January 13, 2000 for use in connection with the credit derivativ=
es=20
product (the =01&Product=018) to be offered by Enron Capital & Trade Resour=
ces=20
International Corp. and its affiliates (collectively, =01&Enron=018) throug=
h =01&Enron=20
Online=018.  These procedures, which we will be assisting you in preparing,=
 are=20
designed to reduce Enron=01,s exposure to those entities on whose credit th=
e=20
Product will be based (the =01&Reference Entities=018) as well as Enron=01,=
s exposure=20
to other related types of liabilities.  We have previously outlined these=
=20
areas of exposure in our memoranda dated December 15, 1999 and December 22,=
=20
1999. =20
1. Disclosure =01* All Reference Entities should be advised, by letter, of =
the=20
fact that they will be included in the list of entities that will be the=20
subject of the Product.  These disclosures will of course be separate from,=
=20
although related to, the disclosures to be provided to counterparties to=20
transactions in the Product.

? This disclosure should inform the Reference Entity of the introduction of=
=20
the Product, and describe the general nature of the Product and the manner =
in=20
which it will be traded (e.g., through Enron Online).

? In general, however, Enron need not request that the Reference Entities=
=20
consent to or acknowledge their inclusion in the list of the Reference=20
Entities, except as set forth below in paragraph 2.=20

  2. Consent =01* Enron should, however, obtain the prior consent of certai=
n=20
types of Reference Entities before including them in the list of Reference=
=20
Entities.

? In particular, consent should be obtained from any Reference Entities wit=
h=20
which Enron has a significant trading relationship that includes advice or=
=20
other services that could result in Enron being considered a fiduciary of t=
he=20
Reference Entity or that could otherwise give rise to common law duties tha=
t=20
could be violated if the Reference Entity does not consent to the arrangeme=
nt.

? Enron need not seek consent from those large and sophisticated=20
counterparties to which Enron merely provides prices and with which Enron=
=20
trades on an exclusively arms=01, length basis with no advisory or similar=
=20
services being provided and with no fiduciary obligations.

? Where consent is sought, Enron should include a request that the Referenc=
e=20
Entity acknowledge its receipt of the letter and its consent to being=20
included in the list of Reference Entities.  If a Reference Entity fails or=
=20
refuses to execute the letter, Enron will need to make a determination, on =
a=20
case-by-case basis, as to whether it is comfortable including that entity o=
n=20
the list of Reference Entities.  However, it should be recognized that, by=
=20
requesting consent, Enron may be limiting its ability to treat an entity as=
 a=20
Reference Entity in the absence of consent.

3. Chinese Wall =01* We understand that it will not be feasible to construc=
t a=20
complete =01&Chinese Wall=018 between the operations related to the Product=
 and=20
Enron=01,s other trading activities.  This is due primarily to the fact tha=
t=20
activities related to the Product will utilize the same credit function as=
=20
Enron=01,s other trading activities.  However, Enron should implement a mod=
ified=20
Chinese Wall between the trading operations.  This approach would enhance=
=20
Enron=01,s ability to defend successfully against any claims of impropriety=
 or=20
breach of duty by facilitating Enron=01,s ability to demonstrate that=20
information had not been shared by other traders with those trading the=20
Product. This could be accomplished through a number of procedures.

? First, Enron should maintain the maximum possible degree of physical=20
separation between personnel responsible for pricing and trading the Produc=
t,=20
on the one hand, and Enron=01,s other trading activities, on the other hand=
. =20
Even if personnel involved in the Product are located on the same floor as=
=20
other traders, it would be prudent to place them in a separate area of the=
=20
floor set off by partitions or similar features.

? Second, procedures should be developed to prohibit the flow of informatio=
n=20
between Product traders and other traders if such information is material t=
o=20
the creditworthiness of trading counterparties and is not in the public=20
domain.  In addition, all trading personnel should be instructed with respe=
ct=20
to the procedures through training programs.

? Finally, senior supervisory officers of Enron should be assigned to monit=
or=20
communications between the groups of traders and to review and make=20
determinations on requests by traders to communicate information that would=
=20
otherwise be prohibited under the procedures.  These procedures will be=20
similar to those that have been developed in connection with Enron=01,s equ=
ity=20
trading activities.

4. Restricted List -- Enron should establish and maintain a =01&restricted =
list=018=20
of those entities on which Products may not be traded.

? Initially, the list could be used to exclude those entities on which it i=
s=20
not feasible for Enron to offer Products due to the nature of its=20
relationships with such entities; e.g., those entities with respect to whic=
h=20
Enron might be considered a fiduciary and which have not consented to their=
=20
inclusion and those entities about which Enron has or regularly receives=20
material, non-public information.  In addition, those entities with which=
=20
Enron has entered into confidentiality agreements will most likely need to =
be=20
excluded, depending on the terms of such agreements.

? Enron should also establish procedures to monitor its receipt of=20
information regarding Reference Entities on which Products are listed. =20
Pursuant to these procedures, Enron should suspend the listing of quotation=
s,=20
and therefore the issuance of new Products, with respect to a Reference=20
Entity, if Enron is in possession of material, non-public information=20
regarding such Entity of a type, or in situations, that render suspension=
=20
necessary or advisable.  This would include situations in which Enron is=20
considering an investment in or a joint venture with a Reference Entity.  I=
n=20
addition, the procedures should provide for Reference Entities to be exclud=
ed=20
or deleted for reasons unrelated to Enron=01,s possession of information as=
=20
well; e.g., where Enron has reached or exceeded its credit limits with=20
respect to such Entities.=20

? The procedures should state that Enron may close out an open position for=
 a=20
Product held by a counterparty, if the counterparty specifically requests=
=20
Enron to do so.  The procedures should also address the pricing of the=20
closing transaction, however, and establish a mechanism for such pricing th=
at=20
minimizes Enron=01,s potential exposure to liability as a result of its=20
effecting a transaction while in possession of material, non-public=20
information.=20

? Enron should provide training to the appropriate personnel, which should=
=20
include instructing such personnel not to furnish Product counterparties wi=
th=20
any notification or explanation of a Reference Entity being placed on the=
=20
restricted list.=20

As noted, we will be assisting you in developing these procedurew, which wi=
ll=20
need to be integrated into Enron=01,s existing policies and procedures.  In=
=20
addition, as we have advised you in our prior memoranda, there are no=20
procedures that will fully insulate Enron from the potential liabilities=20
arising in connection with its offering of the Product.  However, the=20
implementation of the types of procedures described above should assist Enr=
on=20
in mitigating such risks and defending against claims that might be made by=
=20
Reference Entities.
Please call us if you have questions on these or other issues.

I would like to attend.Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after 
our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference 
Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were 
going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was 
to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities 
could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each 
proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or 
not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing 
business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of 
these evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been 
reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by 
no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet 
determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business 
relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require 
significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to 
make important judgment calls.

My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice 
letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved 
your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on 
the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we 
should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those 
customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them 
as a Reference Entity.

We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the 
evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference 
Entities as soon as possible.

Subject: Consent

Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference 
credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at 
the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions 
and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference 
credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial 
decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them.  

As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits 
have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we 
have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be 
black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect that 
are really deep relationships are likely to be with either really small 
counterparties or a very small subset of our large counterparties.

Hopefully I am restating what everyone already thought but if not apologies 
for the miscommunication.

Call me if you want to discuss further.

We forwarding the revised GTC's for EPC and ECFC correcting the definition of

We've deleted this definition:

"Commercial Terms" means that part of this Agreement confirming in writing 
the specific terms of a Transaction which may be in any form adequate at law 
that is issued in connection with a Transaction.

and added the following new definition which mirrors the wording of Section 
1.1 of the online GTC:

  "Special Terms and Conditions" means the special terms and conditions of a 
particular Transaction for the sale or purchase of Products, including but 
not limited to, payment terms, price, quantity/tolerance, Products 
description, specifications, delivery location and delivery window shall be 
as set forth on this website ("Special Terms and Conditions");
We've also made a global change to the entire document replacing "Commercial 
Terms" with "Special Terms and Conditions."

also finalized the form of GTC's for EPC (who trades benzene, xylene and 
toluene) and are forwarding them to you for further distribution.

It sounds like it may be a little while before the IT group gets the final 
approval to move the web site to the outside.  In the mean time, is it worth 
while to send Sullivan&Cromwell print outs of the pages?  Right now there is 
not really much info on the site.  We can identify third party links, the 
type of information we will be providing as well as sources for our data.  
Will this be of use?

Mark,

As discussed, here is the URL for the proposed web site:   
http://ecthou-lndev1.nt.ect.enron.com/westpowernet.nsf/
It is still on an internal server which I hope you will have access to.  Let 
me know if it doesn't work.  

The User ID is: "user1"  and the Password is:  "test"  .

I also ran through several of the web sites from which we gather our 
information and did not run across the occurance of any copyright statements.

In terms of timing, we hope to release the site by the end of January to a 
limited customer listing.

Hey Mark - I thought you had my new (as of July 1997) address - sorry about 
that.  I'm now at:

1322 Rutland
Houston, TX 77008

(713)863-7190 - home
(713)853-7459 - work

I heard about Mrs. Boone in the Scots News.  I thought it was a nice 
write-up.  The Boones were very special people and I regret extremely that I 
didn't get to know them better.

Hope you guys are doing well.  I was in NYC in Nov. but was so busy I didn't 
have time for visits or fun of any kind!  Hope to get back soon but there's 
nothing for NY on the calendar.  Probably DC early Jan., London late Jan. and 
Buenos Aires and Sao Paolo in Feb.  I saw the magazine article (with such 
good photos!) a couple of months back.  My mom actually called to tell me 
about it.

Did you guys get my Christmas card?  I thought Celena might get a kick out of 
it.  Tell Debbie & Celena I said "Hi!" 

Take care,  Mark T.Is it possible to pinpoint the sources of the rumors we discussed yesterday?  
If so, it might be possible to maintain an action against the culprits.  I'm 
not sure exactly what it might be - possibly for slander or tortious 
interference with contract, something like that.  I could discuss it with our 
friend Richard Sanders but it would be a waste of time if we can't identify 
the perpetrator.Looks good to me - there is a chance that I will be out Feb 14 - 18.

Enron Hosts Annual Analyst Conference; Provides
Business Overview and Goals for 2000

HOUSTON, Jan. 20 /PRNewswire/ -- Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE - news) hosted its 
annual equity analyst conference today in
Houston. Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the 
conference by highlighting Enron's tremendous
growth across all businesses and the outstanding 700 percent return to 
shareholders over the past decade. 

     Enron presented key objectives for 2000:
     Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses.
     Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services.
     Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.

Enron's ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a 
recurring theme throughout the day.

Wholesale Energy Business

Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services, 
Enron's largest business. Wholesale energy
growth in North America is expected to be driven by the continuing 
deregulation of power markets in the United States and
large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large energy consumers. Enron 
expects to continue to broaden its early lead
across the European continent as markets quickly open to competition. 
Finally, Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale
presence in other markets such as Japan, where large customers will be 
permitted to choose their electricity provider in March
2000.

EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are 
generated through this innovative, Internet-based
transaction system. Over 450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline 
and over 10,000 transactions have been
completed since its introduction in late November 1999. Yesterday, 
EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with
over 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million. 
Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are
significantly lower than costs associated with traditional transaction 
methods.

Enron's Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, with 
expansions planned or underway on several of its
systems.

Retail Energy Services

With over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in place 
to service customers worldwide. As the strong
contracting momentum continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly 
increase earnings in 2000. Enron Energy Services'
goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts representing $16 billion in future 
expenditures by customers for energy and energy
services, nearly double the level in 1999.

Enron Broadband Services

The new name of Enron's communications business, Enron Broadband Services, 
reflects its role in the very fast growing market
for premium broadband services. Enron is deploying an open, flexible global 
broadband network controlled by software
intelligence, which precludes the need to invest in a traditional 
point-to-point fiber network. This Enron Intelligent Network is
widely interconnected to both other wholesale bandwidth carriers and to 
Internet service providers, thus providing the platform
for two new Enron business centers, bandwidth intermediation and broadband 
content delivery.

A direct transfer of Enron's core market making and risk management skills 
from its energy businesses, bandwidth
intermediation will provide capacity- holders a vast array of alternatives 
for flexible, low cost capacity. Enron will also provide
premium broadband content services, such as high-quality video-streaming and 
large broadband file transfer, with differentiated
levels of quality in a usage-based business model.

As announced in a separate release, Enron also reached an agreement with Sun 
Microsystems that provides for accelerated
development of broadband Internet services.

Enron is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and 
communications companies. The company, which owns
approximately $34 billion in energy and communications assets, produces 
electricity and natural gas, develops, constructs and
operates energy facilities worldwide, delivers physical commodities and 
financial and risk management services to customers
around the world, and is developing an intelligent network platform to 
facilitate online business. Enron's Internet address is
www.enron.com, and the stock is traded under the ticker symbol, ``ENE.''

This press release includes forward looking statements within the meaning of 
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Although Enron believes 
that its expectations are based on reasonable
assumptions, it can give no assurance that its goals will be achieved. 
Important factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those in the forward looking statements herein include 
political developments in foreign countries, the ability to
penetrate new wholesale and retail natural gas, electricity and broadband 
services markets, including the energy outsource
market, in the United States and Europe, the timing and extent of changes in 
prices for crude oil, natural gas, electricity and
those relating to broadband services and content, the timing and effect of 
changes in interest rates, the timing and success of
Enron's efforts to develop domestic and international power, pipeline, 
communications, internet- related and other infrastructure
projects, and conditions of the capital markets and equity markets during the 
periods covered by the forward looking
statements.

Subject: Re: Web side for Colombia  

I talked to Louise Kitchen (MD Enrononline) about how our group could  
leverage on  enrononline for  our plans of a first step with an informational 
site in Colombia  to move  later to a transactional site as Enron stars  
trading activities in Colombia.

What I proposed to Louise is to  get  ISA to include enrononline in the 
"other sites of interest" data  for  Colombia and to also have enrononline to 
include data on Colombia in the enrononline informational site .  She says 
that it is very easy to include this information  and that in principle she 
doesn't  think there is a problem in linking enrononline to ISA if it is 
going to be only for the informational site.  

She referred me to Rahil Jafry (content) to discuss the process to make the 
Colombia information to be included in the site. I talked to him and we 
scheduled a meeting for Friday at 8:30AM.

Please confirm ASAP if you will be available for this meeting

Thanks, Maria Elena

Thank you  Louise,

Just one remark which came back to me already a couple of time.

When we close a transaction with our normal counterparties, why do we need to 
send the GTC each time since when we close OTC witrh these same 
counterparties, this is not necessary ?

They are finding that our confirmations are 13 pages long for a single swap. 
Do you think we could avoid sending the GTC for some of our most active 
counterparties ?

Subject: Aquilia

Bob:

This communication is to keep everyone informed of the back office issues 
related to EOL trades with Aquilia 

The Aquilia office (Aquilia Energy) in Omaha contacted our Settlements team 
regarding the EOL day deals(invoices) stating that they were not Aquilia 
Energy or Aquilia Risk Deals but rather Aquilia Southwest deals.  Aquilia 
Southwest is not approved for EOL trading.  To ensure timely payment, 
Settlements faxed all the invoices to the San Antonio office and have been 
notified that payment for these invoices to Aquilia Energy and Aquilia Risk 
will be made by Aquilia Southwest.  Aquilia wanted us to change the 
counterparty to Aquilia Southwest but it was explained to them that these 
were EOL deals and the counterparty would not be changed.  

Scott Mills provided a query of Jan. EOL deals to (just for Texas business) 
Settlements to help them gauge and anticipate potential counterparty issues.  

Settlements might be able to have another billing address set up for Aquilia 
Energy with the address being the San Antonio office in order to minimize the 
effort to getting the invoices to the correct office.  

I have not heard anything more regarding an assignment processes for Aquilia 
Risk/Energy and would like to know were that stands.  I would like 
clarification about Aquilia Risk having credit approval taken away for 
Physical deals.  

Thanks,
KC


Glad you liked them.  Yes, cats do seem to like to explore all sorts of

had in Bethesda, used to like to sleep at the foot of my bed - under the 
covers.  Go figure.  I'd be happy to send you acopy of the photo of me.

And yes again, the online platform mentioned in the analyst's report is the 
system I've spent so much time on over the last nine months or so.  It's kind 
of exciting to see a project in print like that but now it means we have to 
really make it work!

I received the package from MetLife on the Long-Term Care insurance.  I had a 
couple of questions which I called the company about (premiums, pre-tax vs. 
after tax, etc.) and would be happy to go over it with you.  Do you want me

Trading wants to conduct Basis Swaps of Last Day NYMEX vs the Gas Daily 
Average of ANR Louisiana. I've created the below language accordingly and 
would like for you to review. The words in BOLD were added to make this 
'work'.


Index:  NYMEX HH L1/GD ANR LA
Abbreviation: GD ANR-LA
Sort Code: 1210
Description: The Fixed Price shall be the settlement price for the last 
scheduled Trading Day of the NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract, 
modified by the price submitted by the Counterparty on the website, for the 
applicable Determination Period. [Is this for the contract for delivery 
during the Determination Period - in which case maybe we should say "for 
delivery during the applicable Determination Period"?] The Floating Price for 
the applicable Determination Period shall be the average of the Daily 
Midpoint prices published on each calendar day during such Determination 
Period under the heading "Daily Price Survey" in the Louisiana - Onshore 
South, ANR section of Gas Daily, or if Gas Daily is not published on a 
calendar day is not a Business Day then the price used shall be the Daily 
Midpoint price published on in the next suceeding issue of Gas DailyBusiness 
Day. [Do we have a problem if the next price published is int he following 
calendar month?]

Thank you very much - can I get a copy of the Risk article?  

The BIS numbers unfortunately do not distinguish which of the commodity 
numbers are applicable to energy, and worse yet they include only numbers 
from reporting banks.  In the energy area a large proportion of the 
transactions are by non-bank institutions -this makes finding the numbers 
much harder because companies like Enron are not required to publicly 
disclose their positions.  Hopefully the Risk article has some numbers but if 
you can find anything else specifically relating to the size of the energy 
derivatives markets that would be helpful.

I found an article in Risk, April 1999 titled "Banking on energy derivatives: 
Brokers are acting more and more like investment banks, designing structured 
trades and bundled risk management solutions.  Nowhere is the trend more 
clear than in the energy markets."   Also,  the attached reports describe the 
OTC market.  Please let me know where to go from here.

Here's a draft of a termination letter.  I'd be happy to see what everyone 
thinks before we use it.  For instance, what tone are we aiming for?  If we 
want to be all legal and hard-nosed, I can throw in ETA section references, 
etc. or if we want to be softer we can emphasize other trading opportunities 
within Enron and possibly explain our reasons for the termination.

Let me know what you think.
Just a couple of comments and questions:

Is it appropriate to refer to these as "US" transactions since the prices are 
clearly from outside the US?  I recognize that ENA is the counterparty but I 
think this may be confusing to our customers.

The term Business Day should be capitalized (it's defined in the GTC) [but 
it's defined with reference to NY & Houston banks being open - does that work 
for pulp transactions?].

I'm not thrilled with the language for the last ten days of the contract 
period on the Pulpex description - is that what we use for current 
confirmations?

In the definition of the Index for the Finnish product, the word "relevent" 
should be deleted.

I glanced at the power product description (what I could see of it) - Is it

it really is physical, I'll need to get one of the power trading lawyers to

There are about 15 - 20 pages you would probably want to see.  If that's not 
too many for you to receive I don't mind faxing it.  You can always call me 
from the office with the fax number when you're ready - I can even leave it 
with my assistant when I'm away from my desk in case you get her instead of 
me.

It's finally winter here, too.  Of course that's nothing compared to you guys 
- it might get down into the 30's at night and 40's in the daytime.  It's 
only really bad when it's that cold and it rains.  Brrrr.  It was probably 
pretty smart of Delta to send those planes to Cincinnati since as a hub they 
could probably get them on connecting flights to wherever they were 
originally headed more easily from there than anywhere else (of course a lot 
were probably headed to NYC and the flights there the next day must have been 
packed!).

Aside from a quick one-day trip to New York I haven't had to do any traveling 
lately - I'll probably be going to Portland in early March and Amsterdam 
mid-March.  I may try and get to South America sometime in February but 
nothing is scheduled yet.

Love, MarkSorry for the delay - our general policy is (and the first response to this 
type of question should be) that , due to system requirements, it is not 
possible to provide for different online contracts for different 
counterparties.  Having said that, in the few cases where a counterparty has 
raised what we consider to be valid and material concerns, we have agreed to 
a side letter agreement with that particular counterparty to vary the terms 
of the ETA.  So if the counterparty resist the first response and threatens 
to not use the system for legal reasons, you should refer them to the legal 
department.  They can contact either Carol St. Clair (x33989) or me (x37459).

told her that her PA would not cover this and I am not sure she understood

Therefore she will have transacted in London under a US PA - correct ?

Do we know where J Aron wants us to settle the trade done from London?  If it 
is still settled by payment to New York, this one trade probably does not 
cause too much heartburn. (See the note from Steve Douglas in Tax next 
following.)

To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject: Re: J Aron & Co - Master User in New York , Sub User in London  

Yes.  Our tax compliance system is premised upon the trading "pattern" (type 
of trader, location, etc.) represented to us in the materials pursuant to 
which we establish a counterparty.  In this case, J Aron is transacting via 
either a different legal entity in London or a branch of the entity that was 
initially approved that is located in London with a password acquired on the 
basis that they would be trading from New York (presumably from a U.S. 
corporation).  In either event, while there may not be an issue as to this 
particular transaction, because we do not know the type of counterparty with 
whom we are transacting, we could potentially have a U.S. tax withholding 
issue when settlement payments are made (this, of course, assuming that we 
settle with the London branch/entity trading with the U.S. approved 
password).  Consequently, we would prefer to more tightly contain the trading 
patterns of counterparties and not permit this type of trading (doesn't this 
violate reps made in the GTC?).  Alternatively, if all that is occurring is 
that a U.S. approved counterparty is using a password to transact from a 
different physical location, this presents an issue for the counterparty 
(namely, creation of a taxable presence in London or such other location) 
but, so long as we only settle with the approved counterparty under the terms 
pursuant to which their account was set up (i.e., in the U.S. in the case of 
this transaction), this should not present an issue for EOL.  Give me a call 
should you want to follow up.  Steve.

We have asked the EnronOnline team to send the Master User ID and Password to 
the person who signed the PA.  Our theory was that the signer presumably has 
the authority to bind the counterparty and understands that any holder of the 
password can also bind the counterparty.  If they want to give it to someone 
else, so be it.  But we should not be taking it upon ourselves to send the 
password to someone else unless we have conducted the same level of due 
diligence on that name as we have on the PA signer.  I was told we were not 
looking into the authority of the "nominated" Master Users inn any way but 
that we were taking some steps to verify the authority of the PA signers.  It 
just seemed safer to me to take this approach.The package you sent arrived today.  I'll open it when I get home.

I sent the MetLife insurance materials by regular mail today.These look ok to me but I think somebody who knows what they're talking about 
should look at them too.

I've been thinking about what we could cover at our London trading meeting 
every Tuesday and thought it would be a good idea if we could get you to give 
the group a 15-20 minute overview of US commodities law. I think this would 
be particularly helpful for our newest members, Robert Quick and Mark 
Elliott. Please let me know what you think. Thanks!

Paul:

It seems to me these types of transactions (at least new ones) could be 
covered by an ISDA with some creative confirm work on our part.  It's 
certainly not necessary for us to wait for ISDA to get its act together (it 
may be quite a wait) - we can come up wit our own definitions.  The financial 
power trades might be something of a stretch but we have never had the 
question fully reviewed.  I guess this is another matter to keep in mind as 
the power pool is restructured:  to the extent we have any influence over the 
resulting structure, it would be nice if it fit easily into a standard 
financial trading structure.

Just random thoughts.

Shari, a new question arises re this master. ECTRIC trades following 
commodity derivatives with MS: (a) oil swaps (priced in USD), (b) UK 
electricity - "EFA" elec. forward agreement (priced in GBP) and (c) Nordic 
power (priced in norwegian kroner). Are all these commodities covered by the 
master - at present the latter 2 are probably not covered by an ISDA 
commodity definition, although I understand A&O plan to work on these 
definitions with interested parties in UK/Europe. How does the ISDA deal with 
FX differences - I guess there is a standard approach - GBP and NOK converted 
to USD at spot rate for collateral purposes.

Regards

Paul

Subject: ISDA Master -ECTRIC- Morgan Stanley

I was forwarded a copy of your email to Marie Heard and Paul Simons dated 
10/19/98. In response to your queries: 

1. Date of the Agreement: Notes in our file state that "Francesca" in London 
advised that the earliest outstanding trade between the 2 counterparts is 
Nov. 4 '93. From a legal perspective, it does no harm to leave the date as is 
since all it means is that the Agreement is effective as of that day.    

2. "Transferable Letter of Credit": ECT's standard is to have "transferable" 
L/C's in order to be consistent with the "transfer" language included in our 
Master Agreements. The rationale is that if ECT wanted to transfer its 
rights/obligations under the Agreement to an Affiliate, we would want the L/C 
to be transferable as well. Put another way - having a non-transferable L/C 
would be at cross purposes with having a transferable Agreement. 

Also, we in Houston were not aware that ECTRIC does not normally use 
"transferable" L/C's. Perhaps this should be made clear to whomever does 
ECTRIC's documentation in the future.

In any case, can you pls let me know whether you are happy for "transferable" 
to remain in or whether I should go back to MS and ask for it to be 
deleted.    

3. Name of Guaranteed Party: Agree to change; Marie will have a new first 
page of the Guarantee prepared and forwarded to you. 

4. Guarantee from MS: The normal procedure is for them to send us their 
signed Guarantee when they return our execution copies. The form, though, has 
already been agreed and Marie will send you a copy for your information. 

5. Collateral: I have discussed this with Paul Simons. As I understand it,  
you have concerns whether in the event of the insolvency of MS, ECTRIC could 
redeem cash or US T-Bills in order to fulfil MS's obligations to ECTRIC. Mark 
Taylor feels that ECTRIC would have an enforceable security interest in cash 
even though it may be held in London. Regarding the T-Bills, Paul  mentioned 
that there is to be a meeting on this and other matters in the next few 
weeks. 

In order for us to go ahead and finalise the Agreement, I would be happy to 
go back to MS and ask that US T-Bills be deleted as a form of Eligible 
Collateral.      

Pls let me know with regard to points 2 & 5 as soon as possible. 

Kind regards, 

Shari Stack        







That looks good to me.

This may be one of the things we have to deal with in connection with the SA

Dear Schuyler:

It seems to me that you used to chair a seminar put on by the Euromoney
people on swap documentation.  We used to send our new lawyers and more
experienced paralegals to the introductory course and the more
experienced lawyers to the advanced course.  It appears that Euromoney
is no longer putting this on.  Are you doing something similar through
another provider?

Mark TaylorThe system is certainly not set up to accommodate that now but we could 
probably draft around it on a case by case basis.  It strikes me that while 
we might be able to come up with a legal framework that would allow for this, 
the credit considerations are more problematic.  I would guess that the back 
office will also be unhappy about having to manually rearrange all of the 
trades.  This really seems like it is similar to the Aquilla problem in some 
respects.  When we suggested allowing one entity to trade for another, Credit 
was quite concerned because the system wouldn't be able to check the 
appropriate headroom.  I suppose Credit could just assign the lowest headroom 
for any of the eligible entities to the entire relationship - would  that be 
acceptable to everyone?  Another possibility is for the fund to set up a 
master trading entity which does the trades with us and then does back to 
back deals with whichever entities need the allocations.  That would let them 
do a large transaction on EOL and then smaller transactions with the other 
entities.  Of course, the master trading entity would need to qualify for 
credit on its own somehow.  Guarantees from anyone other than the owner would 
be difficult (upstream guarantee problems).

Subject: 

We have been talking to some of the hedge funds concerning EOL.  They want 
the ability to allocate transactions between legal entities.  They do not 
want to have different ID's and make seperate transaction for each entity 
(during which time the price could move) in order to self allocate.  Do you 
have any ideas on how we can facilitate this?

We met with the commercial team this afternoon and I was able to piece 
together the following:

Access to the auction site will be by clicking on a button on the EnronOnline 
(note spelling) trading page.

Most users of the site will already be signed up for EnronOnline - both a PA 
and ETA executed.

Other users will be given a user ID and password that give them "guest" 
access to EnronOnline and trading access to the auction page.

On the auction page the users may submit their offers to transact (either to 
buy or sell) with Enron.  The page will list a reserve price and identify the 
number of credits to be auctioned.  We are willing to commit to transact up 
to that number with the best bidders (at or beyond the reserve  price) but 
may transact larger volumes if we choose.

Users' offers may be submitted at any time during the auction period (this 
time frame remains a bit unclear - probably one day, possibly a week or more) 
and must remain binding until the close of the bidding and determination of 
winning bidders.

Certain uncreditworthy users may be required to post a deposit in the full 
amount of their offer to buy.

It is not yet clear if we will publish the offers after the fact (maybe just 
the winning offers - all without names of course) or even during the auction 
period but we would like to have that option.

I'm sure I've missed a few points but that gives you the flavor.  Harry is 
preparing the "GTC" for the actual purchases and sales - I assume based on 
our standard contracts for these products.  We need to put the legal 
framework together for the rest of it.  If the existing PA and ETA are 
adequate, that would be great but I haven't reread them with that in mind.  
We REALLY don't want to have to have existing users sign another piece of 
paper.  It makes sense that the existing ETA covers some territory that won't 
matter to users who only have access to the auction page (e.g. references to 
master agreements) so a stripped down version of the ETA for those 
counterparties would make sense.

With regard to the energy exchange projects in Germany the following meetin=

have been scheduled:

1. Concerning the D_sseldorf project we will meet with Mr. Elberskirch,=20
general manager of the D_sseldorf B"rse, on Tuedsday, Jan. 12, between 9:00=
=20
and 12:00 in the morning. Mr. Elbersbusch will be accompanied by two McKins=

consultants, probably Dres. Hirse and Schrader. They will discuss with us t=

feasibility study that McKinsey will present at the next "B"rsenratsmeeting=
"=20
on Jan. 13 (the day following our meeting). As the study has not yet been=
=20
finalized Mr Elberskirch will not forward any copies or drafts to us before=
=20
the meeting. I have indicated that from our side Jay (possibly), Joe, John,=
=20
Chris and myself would participate in the meeting.

2.The initiators of the Hannover project will meet with representatives of=
=20
NYMEX on Jan. 12 at 9:30 a.m. in London. According to Mr. Hagena, who is in=
=20
charge of the project on behalf of the state government of Lower Saxony,=20
representatives of the "Stromwirtschaft", i.e. of the major electricity=20
companies (in particular Preussen Elektra) will also participate in this=20
meeting. After this meeting, i.e. between 15:00 and 17:00, Mr. Hagena and M=

that will probably be raised is whether Enron would be prepared to become a=

that the initial capital contributions of the shareholders (Stammkapital)=

will amount to DM 20 Mio.=20
Participants in the meeting on our side would be the same as in the meeting=

with the D_sseldorf people.

3. The "consensus talks" on the German energy exchange project are now=20

Unless you object, we have decided to structure the auction site with the 
"auction procedures" set out on the bid page, immediately above the "submit" 
button.  As soon as the bid is submitted, the system will check to see if the 
counterparty has already accepted the GTC's or has a master in place.  Here 
is S&C's first draft of the procedures for an auction without a reserve 
price, with no commitment to sell (or buy) and no disclosure of bids to other 
parties.  It is my impression that this is the way the EnBank auctions will 
be conducted.  Is that correct?  Any suggestions/comments?

I wish it were more clear.  I am trying to get down there to talk to the 
commercial people about the business direction and support we can provide but 
until then I don't know that we should get their hopes up.  I had hoped to 
come this week but Randy is here in Houston.  Maybe second half of next

Mike, I agree on having the trading attorneys continue to work on 
transactional work in Bolivia.  I also agree with Fede that to the extent a 
supply contract or off-take agreement is part of an overall financing 
agreement that the work ought to remain with the attorney in charge if 
overseeing the all the documentation for the project.  As always though we 
would be available to review provisions or answer any questions regarding 
Enron's position on trading issues.  Additionally, it may be possible that in 
the future a trading attorney in Brazil may be available to handle Bolivian 
issues as well.

I like to convey my thoughts regarding Bolivia legal responsibilities in 
light of the recent adjustments in commercial responsibility for Bolivia gas 
supply. As of today we have moved all responsibility for Bolivian natural gas 
supply and projects into the wholesale group under Fede. We have also moved 
Gaby over to support the effort. 

In light of the need for my group to focus on making the Argentine commercial 
markets a success and the wholesale groups need to support the projects I 
would like to propose that all Bolivian project related legal work go to John 
Novak's group and  all transactional Bolivian legal work (sales and 
purchases) remain in Argentina. 

I believe this division of responsibilities leverages off everyone expertise 
and eliminates the bottle necks we are having in Argentina regarding the 
project work. It will also allow the Bolivian commercial people to be 
supported best with their respective local legal talent.

Please let me know your thoughts.

I'm afraid I disagree with Justin but prefer not to do so publicly.  It seems 
to me we need a verifiable end time for the Auction Period and should choose 
a time and a time zone that makes sense for the traders and counterparties 
(presumably UK for EnBank but Central for emissions credits).

Justin - are the EnBank contracts physical or financial?  It seems to me we 
should use the same customer profiles - that is if the contracts are 
physical, then any counterparty which can trade physical UK gas should have 
access.  If the contracts are financial, then any counterparty that can trade 
UK derivatives should have access.

It turns out the initial auction product will not be the emissions credits 
but rather the EnBank UK synthetic gas storage product.  They want this 
auction to allow bids to be revoked or revised up until the end of the 
auction period and not to have the ability to accept bids until the 
expiration time.  There is still no commitment to sell anything.  All 
transactions will be for sales by Enron to the counterparty.  I have taken a 
stab at revising the procedures language with this in mind.
Mark Haedicke and I are scheduled to participate in an ISDA sponsored 
conference call which begins at 9:00 Eastern time tomorrow morning.  If that 
call runs over, we may not be able to call you promptly at 10:00 but will 
call as soon as we can.Here's a stab at tthe procedures which provides for hte ability to revise or 
revoke bids during the auction period.

I'm not sure which "process" you are referring to.  I have not yet seen a 
list of proposed reference entities and if any of them have a business 
relationship with Enron they will need to be subject to a deeper legal 
review.  The process for that review has not yet been finalized but for some 
potential reference entitiesit will be very time consuming (i.e. for those 
entities where the extent and nature of the business relationship is 
unclear).  The "soft" Chinese walls also have yet to be built for the US.  
For those walls to be effective there may need top be training for people on 
both sides of the walls.

I'm not sure I agree with you.  There is a big difference between listing the 
price for a reference entity's credit online (i.e. in a nearly public manner) 
vs. providing a price quote to customers who request it.  The almost public 
nature of the marketing  may influence whether or not the reference entity is 
happy with Enron trading the product.  Even if they are not affected in this 
way, having given them notice in advance will at least give us moral high 
ground if the reference entity later decides to object.

I finally got my film developed - this gives you an idea of how often I use 
the camera - and thought you might like these.  Unfortunately the only shot 
on the roll of Bruce didn't turn out - directly attributable to the 
photographer's lack of skill - and we never did have anybody take a group 
shot.  There were several others that you can tell would have been great 
shots if my thumb hadn't half obscured the lens.  The sunset was taken during 
our last night there while you guys were swimming off in the direction the 
picture was taken (if you listen carefully, you can almost hear Ted losing 
his lunch down below).

Hope you guys are well - any trips to Houston on the agenda?

Edmund:

Thanks for your voice mail and sorry for the delay, just a couple of 
questions and minor points ont eh GTC - 

In paragraph 1, the usual practice in North America would be for the executed 
confirmation to control over other evidence.

Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master 
agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions 
should not be included when they determine their rights to call for 
collateral under the masters.

I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6.  Is 
this particular to credit derivatives?

With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that 
these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by 
the Mater User.  It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the 
authority to amend the ETA.  Is the purpose of the second sentence to 
"deactivate" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction?  
If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a 
master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected 
counterparties.  (I can't remember if we required that the counterparty 
execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC 
would acknowledge that the master did not control.)

I'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy 
Event, but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is 
impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days.  If we 
actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have 
the case dismissed, 90 days might do it (I am told that the various periods 
for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to 
more than 60 days).

I'm uncomfortable with the use of the term "Month."  What would the Effective 
Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30?  You could argue that 
it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March.  
The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day 
convention.

This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives  -  should we apply a 
different interest rate to non-US$ payments?

It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US. derivatives 
trading agreements be subject to arbitration.  We rarely submit to the 
jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the 
US.  Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some 
straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC.

Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we 
decided not to include one here for a particular reason?

Again. sorry for the delay.  I will be here all week and happy to discuss any 
of these points.

Mark

Dear Gavin,

Thanks for the latest drafts of the GTCs. 

I have spoken with Paul about the comments on the GTCs from Tax in Houston,

Subject: Re: EnronOnline - Credit Product Documentation  

Edmund:

Thanks for your voice mail and sorry for the delay, just a couple of 
questions and minor points ont eh GTC - 

In paragraph 1, the usual practice in North America would be for the executed 
confirmation to control over other evidence.

Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master 
agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions 
should not be included when they determine their rights to call for 
collateral under the masters.

I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6.  Is 
this particular to credit derivatives?

With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that 
these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by 
the Mater User.  It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the 
authority to amend the ETA.  Is the purpose of the second sentence to 
"deactivate" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction?  
If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a 
master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected 
counterparties.  (I can't remember if we required that the counterparty 
execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC 
would acknowledge that the master did not control.)

I'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy 
Event, but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is 
impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days.  If we 
actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have 
the case dismissed, 90 days might do it (I am told that the various periods 
for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to 
more than 60 days).

I'm uncomfortable with the use of the term "Month."  What would the Effective 
Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30?  You could argue that 
it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March.  
The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day 
convention.

This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives  -  should we apply a 
different interest rate to non-US$ payments?

It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US. derivatives 
trading agreements be subject to arbitration.  We rarely submit to the 
jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the 
US.  Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some 
straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC.

Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we 
decided not to include one here for a particular reason?

Again. sorry for the delay.  I will be here all week and happy to discuss any 
of these points.

Mark

Dear Gavin,

Thanks for the latest drafts of the GTCs. 

I have spoken with Paul about the comments on the GTCs from Tax in Houston, 
and I have also spoken with Tax in London, and there are a few small changes 
to the tax provisions of the GTC which London Tax feel appropriate.  I have 
marked-up the proposed amendments and have also made a few other small 
tidy-up changes as well.

I have made the changes to the US GTC (with collateral) and these changes 
should be reflected in all the other GTCs EXCEPT that the amended references

I received the proposed list of reference entities today.  Here is a draft of 
a memo that I cobbled together to use in trying to get input from others 
within Enron for the restriced list.  Would you let me know what you think?  
I will be meeting with Mark H. tomorrow to talk with him about it.  It isn't 
clear to me who should receive this and from whom it should come.  Since the 
communications people may have relationships with some of these folks, is 
Kristina the right person?  I know that EES has some kind of joint venture 
with AOL - should Vicki sign off?  If it is going to such persons, should the 
memo come from Mark?  Cliff Baxter?  John Sheriff?  Jim Derrick?

cc:  
Subject: Organizational Changes

As Enron's broadband services business grows, we will continue to position 
the company to take advantage of the significant opportunities in this market 
and meet the needs of our global customers.  With that in mind, we've made a 
number of changes within the Office of the Chairman of Enron Broadband 
Services aimed at providing a better focus on the key objectives of the 
organization.  

Joe Hirko and Ken Rice, previously co-CEOs of Enron Broadband Services, will 
continue to jointly manage the strategic direction of the company.  Joe will 
continue as CEO and will be responsible for the primary executive management 
of EBS as well as network build-out, BOS development, cross-market 
capabilities and staff functions.  Ken will assume the role of chief 
commercial officer and will be responsible for developing the commercial 
functions of the organization.
  
In addition, Kevin Hannon has been named chief operating officer and will be 
responsible for the day-to-day operations of EBS.  Kevin was most recently 
CEO of Global Risk Management and, prior to that position, he was president 
and COO of Enron North America, where he has been instrumental in developing 
Enron's trading and risk management business in gas, electricity and other 
emerging markets.  Greg Whalley, president and COO of ENA, will again assume 
his responsibilities for Global Risk Management.

Please join us in congratulating Joe, Ken, Kevin and Greg in their new roles.

All,

I am aware that early in the EnronOnline process, some GTC's were only 
generated for the "With Collateral" category and hence, all companies 
transacting in that commodity were subject to the collateral clause.

I am now starting to wonder if this was an oversight, or if there is a reason 
why all counterparties should be bound by a collateral clause for the 
following GTC's/Products:




I would appreciate any insight which any of you can offer.

I just called Diomedes' office to try and get on his calendar next week.  
They told me he is not there and won't be back until after Carnival which I 
guess means March 9 at the earliest.  I am in Portland the 6th & 7th (Mon. & 
Tues.) and Amsterdam the 13th - 17th (Tues. - Fri.).  Unless an emergency 
comes up it looks like the earliest I can reasonably expect to make it will 
be towards the end of March (27 - 31?).

Mike, I agree on having the trading attorneys continue to work on 
transactional work in Bolivia.  I also agree with Fede that to the extent a 
supply contract or off-take agreement is part of an overall financing 
agreement that the work ought to remain with the attorney in charge if 
overseeing the all the documentation for the project.  As always though we 
would be available to review provisions or answer any questions regarding 
Enron's position on trading issues.  Additionally, it may be possible that in 
the future a trading attorney in Brazil may be available to handle Bolivian 
issues as well.

I like to convey my thoughts regarding Bolivia legal responsibilities in 
light of the recent adjustments in commercial responsibility for Bolivia gas 
supply. As of today we have moved all responsibility for Bolivian natural gas 
supply and projects into the wholesale group under Fede. We have also moved 
Gaby over to support the effort. 

In light of the need for my group to focus on making the Argentine commercial 
markets a success and the wholesale groups need to support the projects I 
would like to propose that all Bolivian project related legal work go to John 
Novak's group and  all transactional Bolivian legal work (sales and 
purchases) remain in Argentina. 

I believe this division of responsibilities leverages off everyone expertise 
and eliminates the bottle necks we are having in Argentina regarding the 
project work. It will also allow the Bolivian commercial people to be 
supported best with their respective local legal talent.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Subject: Equity and Debt Trading - exploratory discussion

Mark, Jeff, Jordan, Shari,

Equity and Debt Trading would like to have an "exploratory" conversation to 
consider the potential economic benefits/impact of offshore investing.  To 
support an offshore investment fund we would need to have offshore originated 
dollars.   Jeff Kinneman has suggested that we get individuals from 
Accounting, Treasury, Tax and Legal with commercial for a initial discussion.

We are trying to set up a meeting over the next two weeks to discuss.  Kelly 
Templeton will be calling you to set up a meeting.  If another person is more 
appropriate, please let me know or tell Kelly Templeton when she calls.

Many thanks. 
Sheila







Looks fine to me.

Please review and offer you approval/comments. This Index is exactly the same 
as the NBSK PIX Index that we just worked on with the exception that its

These look ok.  I'm still unhappy with using an average of the index for each 
day when there is only one index for the entire month but I guess we're stuck 
with it for now.

Subject: FAQ's regarding Agency.

Mark,

I would appreciate your comments on the following FAQ's, intended to be a 
guide for Louise/myself/PR in the event we take a media call regarding the 
injunction/lawsuit. Also, if you have any ideas to expand the list, please 
let me know.


Any calls received from the media will be answered by Louise, or in Louise' 
absence, by myself, with PR in the room (Louise will be back in the office on 
Monday and I suspect it is very unlikely that we would receive any calls 
before then).

Q1 Did Agency.com develop EnronOnline?
A Agency.com was hired to provide development support for some elements of 
EnronOnline. Other elements were designed and built by Enron staff.

Q2 Which elements did Agency.com develop?
A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements 
which Agency was involved in developing.

Q3 What parts of the system did Enron develop?
A We are not currently releasing details regarding the specific elements 
which Enron developed.

Q4 Why have you filed an injunction against Agency?
A We believe that Agency has been releasing confidential information without 
authorisation from Enron.

Q5 What is the amount of your lawsuit?
A We are not releasing that information at this time.

Q6 Do you believe that the release of this information by Agency has damaged 
the competitive lead of EnronOnline?
A We believe that Agency has released information in contravention of the 
terms of their contract with us. Whether or not this release of information 
is damaging to EnronOnline is a matter which has yet to be determined.

Q7 Does this experience make you want to avoid working with outside agencies?
A We believe that outside agencies are a valuable source of expertise which 
can complement the Enron's strong IT skillset. We don't believe that the 
actions of one company in any way tarnishes the ability of other, very 
capable IT consultancy companies.

Q8 Are you happy with the product which Agency.com provided?
A We are very pleased with the final product represented by EnronOnline, but 
are not in a position to comment on the strength of any of the individual 
contributors.

Q9 Prior to this lawsuit, would you have recommended Agency.com to other 
companies looking to build something like EnronOnline?
A No. We would not have recommended for or against the use of Agency.com.

Q10 You must be quite angry that a consultant has splashed your information 
into a public forum.
A We are disappointed that the confidentiality between ourselves and our 
contractor does not seem to have been upheld.

Q11 What do you hope to gain from this lawsuit/injunction?
A We hope to prevent the further release of confidential information.

Q12  If all you want to do is prevent the release of information, why are you 
also filing a lawsuit?
A The lawsuit is required at this time to enable the injunction. If it is 
found that damages have been caused as a result of the information which has 
already been released, then compensation may also be appropriate.










Carol:

As Tana mentioned in our meeting, the Credit guys are in discussions with 
Aspect as to who should be the counterparty to the swap (we think it should 
be JEDI, they think it should be ECT).

There is a master agreement in place between JEDI I and Inland (which 
suggests that there is probably a swap in place that maybe should have been 
transferred and still binds JEDI I).

I finally got to speak with Mike yesterday. The short answer is that Nora 
Dobin in Global Finance legal will be your contact person on everything other 
than the swap. Mark Taylor (or his designee) will handle the swap.

We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of V&E to assist us on 
the Whitewing issues. In case you didn't know, Ron and Trena represented us 
in the creation of Whitewing (and its holding company Condor) and have been 
involved in all the subsequent Condor/Whitewing transactions. Because Jeff 
Eldredge has a significant role in Margaux, I hope having V&E involved here 
and in London will facilitate coordination on these issues.

Subject: Margaux/Whitewing


Ron/Trina/Ben,

I wanted to touch base with you on some Margaux-related issues for Whitewing 
and determine what the appropriate course of action is.  

As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been 
updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the 
synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity.  The method by 
which this occurs is as follows.  Whitewing continues to hold the equity 
interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of 
Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which 
are held by Enron).  Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with 
ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount 
representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making 
a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment 
from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things 
happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of 
the projects through the floating leg).  Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) 
raises approx. $511 mm of capital and, through a whollly-owned subsidiary, 
purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $511 MM.  In 
other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its 
receiveable to Margaux.  The net result is that Whitewing receives cash 
proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a 
floating payment obligation to Margaux.  I've attached a structure diagram 
below.

With this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen.  
The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from 
Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from 
Donette Dewar below).  My question is how do we achieve this result.  First, 
is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need 
to occur at a subsidiary level?  In other words, does the swap fall under the 
definition of "Indebtedness" (clause (viii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP 
Agreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?  If it cannot, is SE 
Acquisition the best candidate to be ENA's counterparty, or do we run into 
issues with the Natwest facility (although they'd likely consent since they 
will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction)?  Once the issue of 
who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined, we need to discuss 
the mechanics by which we effect the transaction.  If we are indeed going to 
open up the Whitewing LP Agreement, I suspect that AnnMarie will need to 
revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections, which is probably no easy 
task.  If not, and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level, we need 
to determine where.  Also, I'm sure this transaction will require 
Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the $40mm threshold.  A

Paul - 

Thanks for your voice mail.  We can't print the list of Reference Entities 
from the website because we have not been given access.  We do need to get 
that list to the various other reviewers in Houston and I am sure that is the 
list that Michael referred to.  

The EnronOnline people are probably concerned because they don't have a final 
list of Reference Entities for their launch.  That list absolutely must be 
scrubbed by the other GC's before it is approved.

Mark,

I finally got to speak with Mike yesterday. The short answer is that Nora 
Dobin in Global Finance legal will be your contact person on everything other 
than the swap. Mark Taylor (or his designee) will handle the swap.

We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of V&E to assist us on 
the Whitewing issues. In case you didn't know, Ron and Trena represented us 
in the creation of Whitewing (and its holding company Condor) and have been 
involved in all the subsequent Condor/Whitewing transactions. Because Jeff 
Eldredge has a significant role in Margaux, I hope having V&E involved here 
and in London will facilitate coordination on these issues.

Subject: Margaux/Whitewing


Ron/Trina/Ben,

I wanted to touch base with you on some Margaux-related issues for Whitewing 
and determine what the appropriate course of action is.  

As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been 
updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the 
synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity.  The method by 
which this occurs is as follows.  Whitewing continues to hold the equity 
interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of 
Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which 
are held by Enron).  Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with 
ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount 
representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making 
a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment 
from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things 
happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of 
the projects through the floating leg).  Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) 
raises approx. $511 mm of capital and, through a whollly-owned subsidiary, 
purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $511 MM.  In 
other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its 
receiveable to Margaux.  The net result is that Whitewing receives cash 
proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a 
floating payment obligation to Margaux.  I've attached a structure diagram 
below.

With this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen.  
The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from 
Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from 
Donette Dewar below).  My question is how do we achieve this result.  First, 
is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need 
to occur at a subsidiary level?  In other words, does the swap fall under the 
definition of "Indebtedness" (clause (viii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP 
Agreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?  If it cannot, is SE 
Acquisition the best candidate to be ENA's counterparty, or do we run into 
issues with the Natwest facility (although they'd likely consent since they 
will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction)?  Once the issue of 
who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined, we need to discuss 
the mechanics by which we effect the transaction.  If we are indeed going to 
open up the Whitewing LP Agreement, I suspect that AnnMarie will need to 
revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections, which is probably no easy 
task.  If not, and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level, we need 
to determine where.  Also, I'm sure this transaction will require 
Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the $40mm threshold.  A 
final logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be 
responsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level.

More generally, are there any other legal or other issues that you see with 
respect to this transaction from a Whitewing perspective?

If you'd like to discuss the transaction further, please let me know.  I'll 
be in Houston the early part of next week, so perhaps we can spend some time

Subject: Re: EnronOnline - Credit Product Documentation  

Edmund:

Thanks for your voice mail and sorry for the delay, just a couple of 
questions and minor points ont eh GTC - 

In paragraph 1, the usual practice in North America would be for the executed 
confirmation to control over other evidence.

Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master 
agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions 
should not be included when they determine their rights to call for 
collateral under the masters.

I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6.  Is 
this particular to credit derivatives?

With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that 
these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by 
the Mater User.  It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the 
authority to amend the ETA.  Is the purpose of the second sentence to 
"deactivate" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction?  
If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a 
master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected 
counterparties.  (I can't remember if we required that the counterparty 
execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC 
would acknowledge that the master did not control.)

I'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy 
Event, but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is 
impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days.  If we 
actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have 
the case dismissed, 90 days might do it (I am told that the various periods 
for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to 
more than 60 days).

I'm uncomfortable with the use of the term "Month."  What would the Effective 
Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30?  You could argue that 
it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March.  
The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day 
convention.

This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives  -  should we apply a 
different interest rate to non-US$ payments?

It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US. derivatives 
trading agreements be subject to arbitration.  We rarely submit to the 
jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the 
US.  Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some 
straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC.

Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we 
decided not to include one here for a particular reason?

Again. sorry for the delay.  I will be here all week and happy to discuss any 
of these points.

Mark

Dear Gavin,

Thanks for the latest drafts of the GTCs. 

I have spoken with Paul about the comments on the GTCs from Tax in Houston, 
and I have also spoken with Tax in London, and there are a few small changes 
to the tax provisions of the GTC which London Tax feel appropriate.  I have 
marked-up the proposed amendments and have also made a few other small 
tidy-up changes as well.

I have made the changes to the US GTC (with collateral) and these changes 
should be reflected in all the other GTCs EXCEPT that the amended references 
to "the United States" in Section 11(B) should remain as references to "the 
United Kingdom" in the non-US and non-Canadian GTCs.  Please let me know if 
this is unclear.

Unless you have any comments on these revisions, please could you prepare 
amended versions of the GTCs in anticipation of any final changes from local 
counsel.

Many thanks,

Edmund.





Does this affect only the "booking" of the transactions?  That is, from the 
contract point of view the trade is still done today, and should be dated the 
dy the trade was done, even though we may not get it into the bood until the 
following day.  Sort of an internal vs. external issue.

Subject: Cutoff Time for EOL Gas Transactions

I talked to each of you a couple of weeks ago, and this topic got pushed 
aside due to some other pressing issues.  However, each of you agreed that a 
standard cutoff time was acceptable for US gas, power and liquids products.  

The best option will be to agree to cutoff at 4pm each day (just to get an 
idea of the numbers we were talking about, I looked at yesterday to determine 
how many deals were traded after 4pm Houston time.  We had three US Gas 
deals, and two Canadian Gas deals).  After 4pm, the bridges would 
automatically roll new EOL deals to the next day.  However, for those deals 
that do not bridge after 4pm, the various risk groups would need to remember 
that these deals are the following day's business.  I am not sure how the 
procedures in Risk would need to be modified for the trader's position 
reports, as the official books would not include these late deals.  Can Risk 
run supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions 
each morning?   

I would appreciate any comments that you may have, and regardless, please 
re-confirm that a cutoff of 4pm works for each of your respective groups.

I understand from Tana that you disagree with the advice we have received 
from outside counsel (Stikeman) regarding the necessary 
procedures/formalities involved in the taking and holding of cash as 
collateral in Canada.  We are in the process of revising our Canadian forms 
for ISDA master agreements and credit support annexes.  Would you mind 
checking into this issue - maybe by discussing your difference of opinion 
with Stikeman (I think the advice came from Fred Erickson in their Calgary 
office)?  I don't want to make our forms overly complicated or impose burdens 
on ourselves that aren't required by law.

However, in accordance with our discussions with Bryan, EnronOnline will be

Subject: EnronOnline

Attached is a draft advice from Mallesons on EnronOnline. Of immediate 
concern to us are the form of the various agreements for the road show next 
week. Mallesons have suggested some minor attachments. These are in the 
annexes to the advice. Following are my comments

Password Agreement  - Fine, seems a good to give address for notices etc.

ETA - I asked Mallesons to consider the wording of the indemnity clause under 
Australian law. The major concern is that in Australia special damages has a 
near opposite meaning to the US. The suggested amendment to clause 3(c) I 
believe we could dispense with. It relates to a concern that an Enron 
acceptance may be accessible on the Website Server. However, from what I have 
been told this is not a foreseeable eventuality.

GTCs - Minor changes. The only one we are unlikely to incorporate relates to 
the  collateral clause. Obviously we are in a position to have different GTCs 
for different counterparties

As a next step Paul I will give you copies of the Password Agreement and the 
ETA for inclusion in Road Show. I expect to settle the advice early week  and 
will circulate it.

Please find attached a further draft of the advice marked up to show the
changes made from the previous draft. <<0437047.DOC>>

In particular please note:

* that we have suggested amendments to the agreements in the schedule
- if these are acceptable for use we will accept the revision mode in the
final version.  If they are not, please let us know.
* as certain negative prices are now possible, it is expected that an
AFMA endorsed amendment to the clause relating to negative prices and market
disruption events will be prepared - this would need to be included in the
GTCs (and your ISDAs)
* it would not seem practical to include the collateral language in
the GTCs only in respect of some clients (as the GTCs are standard
provisions).  Would collateral arrangements in relation to particular
clients using GTCs be best documented separately?
* will offers on EnronOnline be considered by a EAF trader in
Australia before being accepted?
* the trade practices material can be completed whenever it is
convenient for one of our trade practices lawyers to review the working site
as a whole.

considered to be insurance, and therefore we would come under certain

Brent, Andrea and I were hoping you might be available for a 30-minute call 
on Tuesday after 5pm (BA time) or 2pm (Houston time) on Tuesday, Feb. 29.  
The BA office had a meeting last Friday afternoon and has apparently set some 
rather lofty goals, such as online trading for Q3, etc.  Please let me or 
Brent know if you are available and/or alternative times.  

Tomorrow we meet with the American Chamber of Commerce, Wed. with Marval and 
the ADA and the Securities Commission, and Thursday with tax consultants.  
Also, I need to talk with you about Brazil when I return.  Sami has been 
diligent about forwarding deal flow information and there are a ton of 
references to PPA's and SWAPS.  We are still trying to get our arms around 
all the business units in Brazil to track their activity.  Have you heard 
from Yao?  This international position may be right up his alley. Sara 

I'll be there - is it really only to last 2 hours?

Why is Enron's stock so volatile now? Since today's session started, ENE
     has lost another $2.50!

     Mr. Ken Lay replies
     I haven't had a chance to check our stock today, but I think for several 
reasons
     it's more volatile. But before I comment on that, our stock price is 
still up even
     if it went down that much today. It's up 40% since the beginning of the 
year
     when the Dow was down. As recently as mid-December, the stock price is up
     about 75%. That's one reason why it's so volatile. Some people bought in
     along the way, they've had a good strong increase, particularly with the
     uncertainty in the marketplace, people just want to take some money off 
the
     table. As we become more of a technology stock, a high P/E stock, a 
growth
     stock held by growth portfolios, you're going to have more volatility, 
just like all
     the other companies that fit into that category. Throughout the market,
     technology stocks quite often go up or down not just $3-$4 a whack, but 
often
     $10-$12-$15 a whack. What I tell Mark Koenig is I love that volatility 
on the
     upside, but I hate it on the down side. 

     We've had a change in the ownership of our stock. Increasingly, it's 
being
     bought by the growth portfolio managers, and increasingly it's being 
sold by
     the value and other portfolio managers that picked it up at much lower
     valuations, and now at these values they want to take their money and 
put it
     back into lower P/E stocks. I know this makes everybody a little 
nervous, but
     this is probably the world we're in now. I'd rather be in this world 
with a 50 P/E
     than the more stable world with a 20 P/E.Richard:

In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration 
in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to 
judges or, God forbid, juries.  In Canada we are continuing to submit to the 
jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in 
civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts 
generally).  As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap 
agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK 
agreements.  Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts 
(where there are no juries in civil actions).  Should this continue to be our 
policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?  I 
would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely 
enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it.

Thanks,

MarkI have explained to Bryan that the legal due-diligence effort for reference 
entities for trading on EnronOnline will be a lengthier process than that 
which we were able to accomplish before the launch of the EnronCredit.com 
page.  That process is now underway.  Going forward, I would hope that we 
will have more lead time and be able to complete the process for both sites 
before a reference entity is used.

Subject: Meeting times confusion


There has been some confusion as to the schedule for Thursday and Friday.

Thursday is intended to be used to review presentations and concepts and 
generally prepare for the larger Friday meeting. As of yet, we have not 
scheduled any formal meeting times on Thursday.

Friday is the "official" presentation day. Although the core group can expect 
to be offsite for the entire day, other non-EnronOnlinians will only be there 
from 10 am to 12 pm. These two hours will contain the most critical phase 2 
information and discussions and will follow this agenda (incorporating 
various presentations/parts of presentations as decided on Thursday):

 1.  Phase 1.1+  Changes to the current system based on trader and customer 
feedback and issues.
 2. Phase 2
 (i)  Technical
 (ii)  Content & Community 

Dave


I'm not sure what "penalites" they're referring to.  I assume it's a physical 
concept.   If we trade power with these guys I guess you would be the right 
person.  If it's gas, probably Stacy.

penalties would then fall under existing trade agreements.   Is this correct, 
and is Enron working on specific penalty provisions for EOL deals?

through the 17th and plan to be in S.A. the last week in March.  It would be 
grea if we could both be there for the second seminar (looks like the more

Subject: Trip to Brazil

Mark:  I have been in touch with Sami Arap who is now Andrea Bertone's boss.  
There are currently two seminars scheduled in Sao Paulo aimed for the 
commercial group and the lawyers as follows:

1.  March 17 - Milbank Tweed  (Securitization)
2.  March 27 - Bracewell (legal issues for contracts)

I think I should attend these and was considering a trip to arrive before the 
start and after the termination of the seminars (approx March 15 - March 
28).  In the interim I could (hopefully) wrap up financial issues with 
Tozzini and address at length physical issues with Tozzini.  Also, I can 
speak with commercial groups and plan a "swap"seminar for the commercial and 
legal groups (date TBD but probably after the legal seminar in San Antonio).  
Please let me know if the timing works for our group in Houston and if you 
have other thoughts.   Hope all is well.  Sara

I am not available at all on Friday through Tuesday but the meeting can go 
ahead without me if necessary.

I told him I would pass the message along to you for consideration.   He

in preparation for opening up EnronOnline to Japanese counterparties.  If you

Mark Haedicke, Greg Whalley and I will be meeting with several people at the 
NYMEX on Friday morning.  It's possible (although not likely) that Dan 
Rappaport will attend one of the meetings.  I remember that we were very 
unhappy with his testimony earlier this year and I know we delivered that 
message to the NYMEX a couple of times.  What I'm not sure of is whether 
their testimony was toned down at all in subsequent hearings.  Are you aware 
of the content of the NYMEX testimony at those hearings and whether or not 
our complaints had been taken to heart when it was prepared?  I'm just 
wondering if there is anything we should bring up in our meetings if 
Rappaport does attend - either positive or negative.

I also heard just a few minutes ago that Mark H. had cancelled our trip to DC 
currently scheduled for 12/16 since he will be meeting with Commissioner 
Newsome tomorrow.  It might make sense to leave the December meeting on the 
calendar, though.  Seems to me the Enron message may get lost in the overall 
background noise of a big ISDA meeting.  Maybe I can come up alone and we can 
do a scaled down version of the originally scheduled meeting to get some solo 
time in the Commissioner's face.  What do you think?Dave - Do we have a copy of this marked to show the changes fromt he NA ETA?

Mark,

We have customers who are now filling out the new form of the Australian PA. 
As a result, we will need an Online Australian ETA very shortly.

Can you please approve/disapprove of the ETA form forwarded by David Minns? 
(copy attached). Once we have your approval, we will put it on the system.



Thanks,

Dave

I had assumed we were going to have a separate PA for the Auction-only 
counterparties.  The PA contains an unfortunate reference to the ETA which 
will need to change if they will only be accepting the Auction-only agreement.

Subject: New PA form

Mark/Justin,

Attached is a copy of the Australian PA. It includes the addition of an 
Address for Service.

Do you think we should incorporate this in our other PA's as well?

I realise that in many instances we are already doing business with the 
relevant company - and the same or similar information might be included on 
the Registration form (where completed) - but are you concerned about 
ambiguity in the event that no Registration form is completed?

Also: We will need to have some way to distinguish PA's which arrive for 
customers who want access to Auctions only. What do you think about adding a 
statement like: "(Optional): Tick this box if you wish to have access only to 
EnronOnline auctions and not to the main transactions site"  [tick box].

If you wish to proceed with either of the above, we will need to revise all 
PA's and post them on the website.

Thanks,

Dave

May I also point out that we went to great pains to keep the PA to a single 
page.  This one looks like it runs over to the second page - at least as laid 
out here.  I was also under the impression that a completed registration form 
was required before a user ID and password could be issued.  While I don't 
object to having an address for notices on the PA, I don't think it is 
necessary in North America if we have a completed registration form.

Does this affect only the "booking" of the transactions?  That is, from the 
contract point of view the trade is still done today, and should be dated the 
dy the trade was done, even though we may not get it into the bood until the 
following day.  Sort of an internal vs. external issue.

Subject: Cutoff Time for EOL Gas Transactions

I talked to each of you a couple of weeks ago, and this topic got pushed 
aside due to some other pressing issues.  However, each of you agreed that a 
standard cutoff time was acceptable for US gas, power and liquids products.  

The best option will be to agree to cutoff at 4pm each day (just to get an 
idea of the numbers we were talking about, I looked at yesterday to determine 
how many deals were traded after 4pm Houston time.  We had three US Gas 
deals, and two Canadian Gas deals).  After 4pm, the bridges would 
automatically roll new EOL deals to the next day.  However, for those deals 
that do not bridge after 4pm, the various risk groups would need to remember 
that these deals are the following day's business.  I am not sure how the 
procedures in Risk would need to be modified for the trader's position 
reports, as the official books would not include these late deals.  Can Risk 
run supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions 
each morning?   

I would appreciate any comments that you may have, and regardless, please 
re-confirm that a cutoff of 4pm works for each of your respective groups.

Mike - any potential problems with the DPR?
Peggy - we discussed briefly a few weeks back...any thoughts?  











Edmund - 

I have reviewed the long descriptions I was given for the credit derivatives 
(I can't tell if they are current) and have substantial comments - I have 
attached what I have come up with (sorry it's in 2 pieces).  Basically I 
don't think we should be restating something in the Long Description that is 
already covered (sometimes with different language) in the GTC - this only 
creates an ambiguity and is not necessary to form a complete contract.  My 
other concern - and I have not been able to draft language to fix it - is 
that I can't find any definition of the Seller Payment amount and I don't 
think the Buyer Payment language works  -  can you give me a call so we can 
discuss my concerns?

Subject: Proposed Meeting of Major Energy Trading Houses

There is a proposal to have a meeting of the head traders of Enron, Reliant, 
Sempra, Coral, Duke, Southern, Dynergy and El Paso.  The idea would be to 
talk about e-commerce in the energy business.  Specifically, Enron might 
propose standardization of our masters, start-up of a clearing house for 
energy trading, electronic mechanism for confirmations, opening EOL to other 
companies to post bids and offers, and discuss electronic protocols for 
transactions with other energy companies to reduce costs.  We would probably 
discuss the state of regulatory restrictions under the CEA.

What are the anti-trust issues for such a meeting?
What are the appropriate parameters for such meeting?
Should legal counsel be in attendance?
Would it be best to make invitations through a formal letter?
This looks good to me.  Thanks!

I have asked Kaye for copies of the CA's referred to.  I agree completely re: 
the need for a procedure.  Let me know what you think about the following:

1. Commercial team identifies the proposed reference entity (RE) and forwards 
the name to Credit.  At the same time, the commercial team should be 
identifying any Enron relationship with the proposed RE and discussing the 
proposal with the appropriate relationship head(s).  

2. Credit reviews the proposed RE and approves or rejects (so far there have 
been many rejections so this makes sense as a next cut).  If approved, Credit 
notifies the commercial team which then forwards the approval to Legal 
together with the results of their investigations regarding other Enron 
relationships.

3. Legal conducts a "screening" Confidentiality Agreement review locally and 
forwards the name to the other Enron legal groups for similar review.   If 
the screen reveals confidentiality agreements with the RE or any of its 
affiliates, the commercial team should be consulted to determine the 
appropriate level of further review.  If the commercial team considers the RE 
the subject of legitimate transactional interest, detailed review of the 
confidentiality agreements and their impact may be appropriate.  In addition, 
if the confidentiality agreement screens are passed, Legal should analyze the 
"other Enron relationships" to determine if they raise any legal concerns.  
Upon final approval, Legal notifies the commercial team (copying Credit).

Something this involved may make sense only for RE's that will be offered on 
the website.  Perhaps a streamlined version would suffice for RE's only 
offered pursuant to an unsolicited request.

Subject: Re: Indicative request to buy  

Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple.  Duke Energy Trading & Marketing 
is a marketing sub and does not prepare separate financials.  The S&P rating 
is based on an implied guaranty from Duke Energy.  Legal would also need to 
review this counterparty from the standpoint of confidentiality agreement 
violations. 

Also, as a trading counterparty, Sempra Energy Trading is not authorized for 
credit derivative trading, because the existing guaranty does not explicitly 
cover this type of transaction.  If Sempra wishes to transact out of this 
entity, we can look into amending the guaranty to cover this product.  This 
will require legal efforts and approval.

Subject: Re: TXU/Eastern - ETA comfort letter  

Dave:
I've read the comfort letter.  With respect to item #1, the first paragraph 
is fine.  With respect to the second paragraph, what situation is he trying 
to address?  For example, I thought that in situations where the counterparty 
clicked on a price and the price changed in the counterparty's favor before 
the trade was executed, that the counterparty would get the better price.  
The second paragraph might negate this as written.  Can a situation really 
arise where the system misreads a counterparty's offer?  I think that we need 
to be very careful in what we say here.

With respect to point #2, I need to defer to Mark Taylor on this because I 
thought that the confirmations control, but it could be the case that our 
electronic records could prevail if there is a conflict between the 2.  That 
would seem to make sense to me but I would prefer that Mark concurred with 
this.

Subject: Re: confidentiality query  

I have asked Kaye for copies of the CA's referred to.  I agree completely re: 
the need for a procedure.  Let me know what you think about the following:

1. Commercial team identifies the proposed reference entity (RE) and forwards 
the name to Credit.  At the same time, the commercial team should be 
identifying any Enron relationship with the proposed RE and discussing the 
proposal with the appropriate relationship head(s).  

2. Credit reviews the proposed RE and approves or rejects (so far there have 
been many rejections so this makes sense as a next cut).  If approved, Credit 
notifies the commercial team which then forwards the approval to Legal 
together with the results of their investigations regarding other Enron 
relationships.

3. Legal conducts a "screening" Confidentiality Agreement review locally and 
forwards the name to the other Enron legal groups for similar review.   If 
the screen reveals confidentiality agreements with the RE or any of its 
affiliates, the commercial team should be consulted to determine the 
appropriate level of further review.  If the commercial team considers the RE 
the subject of legitimate transactional interest, detailed review of the 
confidentiality agreements and their impact may be appropriate.  In addition, 
if the confidentiality agreement screens are passed, Legal should analyze the 
"other Enron relationships" to determine if they raise any legal concerns.  
Upon final approval, Legal notifies the commercial team (copying Credit).

Something this involved may make sense only for RE's that will be offered on 
the website.  Perhaps a streamlined version would suffice for RE's only 
offered pursuant to an unsolicited request.

Mark, herewith the list I referred to in my last email.  I've looked to see 
if there are any CAs with a Duke entity with an Enron European entity and 
there are none.

We ought to come up with a streamlined procedure for approving new reference

several departments).

FYI, there apppears to have been a sea change in Bryan's attitude to having a 
hard Chinese wall for his trans-atlantic credit trading group.  In short, he 
wants to be behind one and apparently John Sherriff is comfortable with 
this.  I have therefore asked Ken Raisler to advise us on how to construct a 
Chinese Wall from a practicle, US perspective, with the intention of having 
Sanjev at Slaughters modify the "instruction kit", as necessary, to work 
under English law.  Given Ken's involvement on equity trading, he appears to 
be the right place to start.  There remains the possibility that when the 
traders see the procedures they will change their minds and wish to stick 
with the existing procedures you have seen.

This will not impact launch of credit trading online which, as advised, is 
still set for tomorrow.

Please let me have any thoughts on this.

Regards

Paul

 Hi, folks.
 All of you have expressed an intent to bring your boats out to meet
New World on Saturday.  It's looking like we have about 32 boats coming out.
We're hoping to raft together as many as possible off the restaurant's dock.
I know some of you who have your own slips nearby will be taking your boats
home and driving over to the party.
 But we've had one skipper mention that he wouldn't be willing to
raft together with others out of fear for his thin, wooden hull.  We've
secured him a nearby slip, and we could come up with a few more if we must.
If for any reason you believe you cannot raft together with the other boats,
please let me know immediately, and I'll see what I can do.
 Also, if you haven't seen the plan (updated today), please visit
http://www.chron.com/content/interactive/voyager/sail/party/boats.html.
 Thanks.  And we'll see you on Saturday.

My assistant, Jan Dobernecker, tells me that Sylvia Sauseda has arranged for 
an office for you here on the 38th floor.  The room number is EB3850.  Sylvia 
is in the process of arranging for a telephone and computer for your office 
and will talk to HR about a badge.  HR should have the badge waiting for you 
at the desk in the lobby when you arrive.  If it isn't and your HR person is 
not available, just call Jan Dobernecker at x33427 and she will tell them to 
let you in.  Sylvia will also attempt to find parking for you.  If you 
haven't heard from her by Friday, I suggest you park in any of the uncovered 
lots near the building on Monday morning.  They are more reasonably priced 
than the garages (which sometimes charge $20 or more for a single day if you 
don't have a contract).  We're looking forward to seeing you!

Have a good trip.

All systems ready to go on Friday morning.  I thus expect to be in the office 
on Monday morning (18 Jan.).  Could you please ask one of the assistants to 
help in organising and setting up a working station (computer and the rest of 
the requisite gear).  Also, since it is a bit tricky to establish contact 
with Houston H/R, this person could perhaps arrange a card/badge for me and a 
car parking ticket (or advise me where to put the car on Monday morning).

I'm looking forward to seeing you and the rest of the Legal Dept on 18 Jan.

Martin

I have not been given any reasons - the most "considered" list came from EBS 
where I feel sure some of them were commercial.  I'm not so sure about the 
EES and GPG lists.  These lists are going to some fairly senior people.  I'm 
a bit hesitant to add to their workload if it isn't necessary.  My suggestion 
would be that we ask for reasons or maybe further research on only those you 
particularly want to list.

I'm told that the advice from Japanese counsel was recieved yesterday but I

these e-mails if they are talikng about sending out initial packets on May 11

In talking with Nick yesterday evening, I learned that most people are off in 
Japan during the week of May 1.  April 29 and May 3 through 5 are all 
national holidays (Greenery Day, Constitution Day, National Holiday and 
Children's Day respectively).  Furthermore, Nick advises that many people 
start the holiday week early and stretch it into the following week.  This 
makes our selection of May 1 week for EOL a most unsatisfactory choice.   I 
would recommend that we shoot for May 10 or 11 (which would conflict with 
possible high profile participation in an APEC meeting, which I'll be 
managing) or preferably the week of May 15.  We could introduce EOL earlier, 
but publicity would be reduced given Rebecca's schedule for interviews and 
lead time for printing/mailing promotional packets.  It would be very tight, 
but we could do it the week of April 24.  Rebecca could provide overview 
interviews, supplemented by an EOL demonstration and your explanation of how 
this provides a platform to build our business.  Do you have 
preferences/limitations from a business activity perspective?  Unless you 
object, on Monday I'll get recommendations from our PR firm and also check 
Louise's availability/desire to be part of the EOL introduction.

John

I guess it depends on where you got the prices - were they from a particular 
publication?  If not, I would suggest that you go to the NYMEX website and 
check for older prices there and you can cite to that.  Let me know if that 
doesn't work.

Doug Leach said you were the expert.

I am publishing a chart using NYMEX settlement average prices by month in

there a data bank that has these prices or a hard copy that I can reference

him and benefit from his experience in the e-arena. He is available tomorrow 
at 11 am or 4 pm. Both these slots are available on my calendar.  Can you let

David:

Tana and I would like to talk with you to set up the counterparty approval 
process for EnronOnline regarding Australian counterparties (trading 
Australian and other products) and Australian products being traded by 
non-Australian counterparties.  The EnronOnline people are anxious that Tana 
be designated their liaison and we need to figure out what she can do and 
what you (or someone else in Australia) need to do as part of this process 
going forward.  Any chance you might be available for a telephone 
conversation about this at 9:00 am your time (5:00 pm Houston time) today?

Pets In the Office
 It's A Growing Trend

 In the dog-eat-dog world of business, there's a growing trend at some 
companies. Workers are bringing their
 pets to the office. 

 Chip Paucek, who produces educational videos and television programs, has 
been taking his golden retriever,
 Hoss, to work for the last five years. Paucek and Hoss visited The Early 
Show and talked with Co-Anchor
 Jane Clayson. 

 The dog has became the office mascot, says Paucek. "He brings a lot of 
emotion and people love it. He's
 very relaxed." 

 But Paucek, as co-president of his company, has the freedom to bring Hoss to 
the office if he wishes. Not
 everybody can bring their pet to work. 

 "A lot of it depends on the dog," says Paucek, who explains that Hoss is not 
a rowdy dog. 

 "He just hangs out," explains Paucek. "He's easy to get along with." 

 Hoss has free rein at the office. When Paucek is away on trips, "My wife 
brings him in and drops him off at
 the office," Paucek says. 

 While there are plenty of positives to pets in the workplace, there are also 
many legal issues to consider. John
 Challenger, CEO of an international placement company, agrees that the trend 
of bringing pets to the work
 place is really growing. 

 "More and more companies in this tight labor market are trying to make their 
working place
 employee-friendly and many are looking at bringing pets into the workplace," 
says Challenger 

 He points out, however, that there are serious issues that employers and 
employees need to explore before
 they adopt a pets-in-the-office policy. 

 "One of the things that the companies must do, before they jump into a 
policy like that, is take a poll
 of their employees and find out what they're thinking. If you have certain 
employees that don't feel
 comfortable with pets, you might want to rethink the policy." 

 There are liability questions as well. For example, the company might be 
liable if a dog or cat bites or
 scratches another employee. 

 "The company ought to talk with their attorneys before they put this kind of 
policy in effect," says
 Challenger. "The employee needs to understand that if their dog bites 
someone or the cat scratches
 someone, it can't be the company's fault." 

 Allergies are a major deterrent to bringing cats to the office. 

 "Many people are allergic to cat hair. You have to think, as an employer, 
will you put them in a
 certain part of your space. What about people who are afraid of animals? 
Many don't feel
 comfortable with them around. Just how many do you want? Do you want cats 
and dogs and what
 about birds? What about the noise of birds?" 

 Paucek admits that when there's more than one pet in the office, "It gets 
chaotic." 

 In 1997, the American Animal Hospital Association surveyed 1,225 pet owners. 
They found that: 

      21% of those surveyed had taken their pets to work 
      76% feel guilty about leaving their pets at home while they're on the 
job 
      33% said they leave a TV or radio on for their animals


 If a company decides to allow pets in the office, they should: 

      poll employees before they let the pets come 
      provide a written policy about pets and list which pets are not welcome 
in the office 
      establish an off-limits-to-pets area 
      make sure employees bring documents proving pets are vaccinated 
      bar noisy, destructive, or messy animals from the office 
      tell employees to keep control of their animals at all times


 If many employees want to bring their pets to the office, the company should 
make a rotating schedule. 

 When the pets-in-the-office policy does work, it's great. Paucek says when 
he and Hoss arrive at work, "I get
 off the elevator. He goes one way and I go the other. He says hello to the 
employees. He has his own
 web page."This looks good to me so I will go ahead and approve it unless you have an 
objection.

Hi Mark -

Julia Deans from the QD Singapore office  got in touch with me this morning.  
Apparently Warren is in Tokyo on a work assignment until February so it won't 
be so easy to meet up with him as we'd hoped.  Warren  offered to  try and 
fly into Singapore this weekend to meet the 3 of us but I told Julia that I'd 
have to confer with you first when Houston opens today.  However,  following  
that conversation, Julia's note (see below)  came in. 

Seeing that Warren will be in your 'vicinity' next month - it certainly makes 
far more sense for him to wend his way to Houston in February so I shall tell 
Julia to shelve Warren's initial offer to fly into Singapore this weekend. 

I will forward Warren's academic details to you upon receipt from Julia.

Thanks,
Anita

Dear Anita,

It was good to talk to you this morning and I hope we will meet in person 
soon.  In the meantime, I wanted to let you know that Warren Simmons will be 
on vacation for two weeks beginning in early February.  He is planning to go 
to New York City so could make himself available for a meeting in Houston 
relatively easily.

I will forward Warren's academic information to you later today.  If you need 
any other information in the meantime, please do not hesitate to let me

Stacy Carey called back to say that the $500 would appreciated as would a

Here is the revised Koch confirmation marked to show the changes.
I realized after I had sent the Koch confirmation to you (but before I faxed 
it to Koch) that I might have given too much away by using the Effective Date 
as the Buyer Payment Date.  In the version I send to Koch I will change that 
to Trade Date.  You can always change it to a later date if you want to 
tomorrow.I believe that this is not the GTC but rather the master agreement used for 
bandwidth.  I spoke with Cynthia Harkness, one of the bandwidth lawyers, last 
week.  My impression was that the bandwidth trading documentation was still 
in flux and they were waiting for it to settle down before preparing a GTC.

Here are my comments on the agreement:

1) Change references from Reuters Group plc to Reuters America Inc.

2) Delete last sentence of Section 3 or insert the words "at Protected Party's
expense" after the text "best efforts"

3) Insert the following at the end of the first sentence in Section 4:

,  and that is designated in writing as confidential, proprietary or marked 
with
words  of  like  import or, if orally conveyed, Protected Party provides 
written
notice  describing  in  reasonable  detail the portion of the oral 
communication
that  shall  be deemed Confidential Information and delivers such writing to

within 10 days of the oral conveyance.

4) Insert the following at the end of the last sentence in Section 4:

or  (d)  is  developed  by  you independently of any Confidential Information 
it

5) Insert the following right before the last sentence in Section 6

However, the Protected Party represents and warrants to you that it has the
right to make the disclosures permitted under this Agreement without violating
any applicable law or regulation or any legally enforceable agreement to which
it is a party.

6) In Section 9, replace "Money damages would" with "Money damages may".  
Change
both  references  of "Texas" to "New York".  Delete the five sentences 
regarding
arbitration.

Jay -

Thanks for your note.  This definitely falls into the "(b)" category.  The 
problem is that there are sooooo many things in the b pile already that I 
can't tell you exactly when this will be resolved.  

Having said that, I agree that the weather information is probably the least 
risky, but it might be helpful if you were to visit their sites and see if 
there is any comment about further use of the information posted there.  As 
for the others, a little additional information would be helpful.  For 
instance, I know we were in discussions with NGTL at one time and were 
unwilling to sign the letter they asked for.  Was there ever any follow-up 
with them on that?  Is there any correspondence at all (it doesn't have to 
look like an official contract).  Is the Telerate information also available 
from other sources?  Is it possible that Telerate gets it out really fast and 
that is their advantage but others are right behind with the same or very 
similar information?  Do we have an agreement of any kind with Telerate 
regarding the services they provide to us?

Thanks for your help and continuing attention to this - I agree we should be 
trying to do this the "right" way.

Subject: Legal Issues with EnronOnline Newsticker


	

Dear Mark (back from South America?)

I received this email from Donna Greif.  It explains the sources for her data 
which she puts on EnronOnline every day.  As best I know, Mark, we don't have 
any agreement with any of these people for content that we place online.

I'm not too concerned about the weather (it's from the Canadian and American 
governments) but I am concerned about the NGTL data and the data we get from 
Telerate.

We have a disclaimer Online for the NGTL data, saying that it's our 
reproduction and not a representation of what they have on their own site 
(their own site which can be accessed through a password only!), but I think 
this proves, rather than refutes, the fact that we're redistributing their 
data without a right to do so.  The same applies for Telerate--we don't even 
give them recognition--we just post their numbers on our site.

I know you're a busy man, and I'm sure you're dealing with things like 
lawsuits against Enron by South American governments, or something like that, 
but this issue should (a) be dropped, because you believe that it's really 
not that important or (b) resolved, becuase you think it is.

Please tell me how I can help, or if we should let this issue drop.  If I

Subject: Re: EnronOnline Newsticker  

Jay,

In your original email (attached below), you requested my source of US Nat 
Gas Stats that are posted as a newsticker item on the website.   Please note, 
I would have been more than happy to provide you with source details on the 
Canadian Weather Forecasts and NGTL Pipeline Data if it was part of your 
original request.

US Natural Gas Statistics (Gas in Storage & Cumulative Heating Degree Days)
 * My source is the Producer Newsletter distributed by the Mid-Marketing 
Department (Ross Prevatt & Dan Diamond
    are both part of that team).  For your convenience, I've attached a copy 
for your records
 * The Producer Newsletter is distributed on a weekly basis (Monday nights or 
Tuesday morning)
     and is faxed.  
        - the Mid-Marketing Department gets those numbers from several 
different sources.
        - I called Ross again today to re-verify.  He confirmed the following 
for me:
  * Gas Storage data comes from a direct feed from Telerate.
  * Lucy Oritz passes on the cumulative heating degree days to Ross.
       > Her source is National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration
       > web address = http://www.crh.noaa.gov/grr/wfolocat.htm
     - Should you require any additional details and need to make contact 
with Ross again.....
       I did take the liberty of explaining who you are, the group you 
represent as well as
       why you were needing this information.  I am sure he will be fully 
receptive and understand
       the nature of your question should you need to contact him again.  

Canadian Weather Forecasts (4 day forecast for 5 cities)
NGTL Pipeline Data (Prior day deliveries, etc.)
 * Candace Spencer & Terri Brian in Enron Canada's office pull this 
information from two different sources.  
 * They pull this information together, and fax updates us each morning.
     - NGTL Pipeline Data is pulled from 
http://www.nrgexpressway.com/ngtl/index.htm
  * You must have a password to gain access to this information.
     - Canadian Weather Forecast data is pulled from 
http://weather.ec.gc.ca/alberta_e.shtml
  * Upon reaching the site, you would select the appropriate City.
  * Once in the city, scroll down to get the weather forecast data.

My apologies for any mis-communications on your original request.  Feel free 
to call me if you are in need of more 
details (x3-9517).

Thanks,

dg


P.S.  Currently, Noel Petterson is updating the website.  His back-up is Matt 
Motsinger.   In additions (just an FYI), this
will be my last week with the EnronOnline team.   Please forward any future 
requests to Frank Davis.

Subject: EnronOnline Newsticker

Following our exchange of emails two weeks ago, I spoke with Ross (whom you 
suggested), but he didn't know of you & didn't think that anything he 
produced was sent to you.  He suggested that I contact Dan Diamond, who wrote 
back saying that he didn't know anything either but that I should contact 
Rahil Jafry.  The only problem of course is that I work with Rahil, and I'm 
trying to find this information in response to a discussion that I had with 
him!

So, could you tell me exactly where you get your information from, for the 
following items:

Canadian Weather Forecasts (4 day forecast for 5 cities)
NGTL Pipeline Data (Prior day deliveries, etc.)
US Natural Gas Stastics (Gas in Storage & Cumulative Heating Degree Days)

Even if you don't know the specific source, if you could tell me how you get 
the information, then I'll try to follow it up.  So, for example, 'Each day 
at 6am I receive a fax from 713.853.2297 with a list of numbers.  I take 
these numbers and put them in the Canadian ...'

Sorry to keep bothering you, but this is a potentially serious issue for 
us--we need to know exactly where we're getting our content from, and no one 
seems to know!  So anything that you can do to help would be appreciated 
greatly.

Thanks in advance

Jay

The EnronOnline team gets those numbers from the weekly Newsletter 
distributed the ENA Commercial Team.   Ross Prevatt is the individual who
actually puts the information together.

In talking with Ross this morning, that information is taken from a Telerate 
feed  (the Telerate feeder gets the info from daily/weekly/monthly 
publications).  Ross did not give me the specific companies that publish the 
information.  Feel free to call Ross directly if you need additional 
information.

Thanks,

Dear Donna

(Following the voicemail that I left for you on Friday)  I was wondering if 
you could tell me whether or not the US Gas Storage data & the cumulative 
CDD/HDD data are taken from inside Enron only?  (I'm asking because Paul 
Goddard has encouraged me to update our letters of consent for content that 
we carry on the website.)

Many thanks,

Jay

Thanks for the messages - I have not heard anything since they left.  VERY 
good news!Hey guys!

Wow - 10 acres - sounds like a ranch!  I'm still working at Enron in Houston 
- it's a good size energy company and the subsidiary I work for does a lot of 
trading of electricity and energy commodities like natural gas and oil.  I'm 
in the legal department and work on derivatives trading contracts and 
issues.  I just got promoted a few days ago so I guess things are going well.

I had an e-mail from Paul Palmer a year or so ago and sent a note back but 
haven't heard from him since.  Mark Kopinski & I stay in touch - he's in New 
York managing a couple of international mutual funds.  He & Debbie adopted a 
little girl (Celena) from China and seem very happy living in a high-rise in 
the middle of Manhattan.  I get up there on business a few times a year and 
try to stop in to say hi.

I was in Monmouth for our 20 year class "reunion" last June.  There were only 
2 of us there and I didn't even remember the other guy!  Oh well, maybe the 
25th will be a bigger draw.

C.F.&S.,
MarkI'm not sure - I thought we were not adding any products -- just opening 
existing products to Japanese counterparties.  Is he talking about the 
existing GTC's for petroleum products?

Alan,

Have you had a chance to review the EOL contracts that we will be using in 
Japan for the rollout of the international petroleum products?  If not we 
probably should take a look.  I would also like to have B&M review as well.  
Pls send me a copy when you have this available.  We are shooting to have 
products posted by the end of the month and an official rollout 10-12 May.

While EOL should be ready to go, there could be some complications with FX 
coming from Sydney, commodity prices from Singapore and even help desk 
support from London.

Let's talk about this early on this week.

thanks,

Joe

Doc:

The schedule calls for the meetings to end at 5:00.  There's also a play (The 
Merry Wives of Windsor) that night and we can work around that if you were 
planning on going.

MarkThanks for forwarding all of this stuff - so far it has all been mine.  I 
think your name must come up automatically for some of these folks when they 
just type in Mark Taylor.  It's not nearly as bad as when there was another 
Mark E Taylor - and he wasn't nearly as nice about it either (instead of 
forwarding them to me, he would send them back to the senders with sometimes 
nasty notes like 'try to get it right next time').   Luckily for both you and 
me he is no longer with Enron -- can you imagine how bad it would be if there 
were three of us?  When I get these, I usually send a note back to the sender 
letting them know that there are two of us and they need to pay attention 
when addressing things to one or the other.

Dennis-
We had incorporated PG&EES's comments to the last draft we sent out last week 
some time and had left those comments in brackets as we did not have EES's 
input.  Some of those changes were accepted by Jeff and some were not.  
Deborah Culver also had some issues with a few of their changes, which we 
need to finalize during this upcoming call.   I believe you should have 
received these via prior e-mail from Mary Moreland of your firm, but for your 
reference, attached is the latest version of the agreement and of Schedule 1.

Jeff indicated that he would let me know when he was available for a call, 
but I have not heard back from him.  I'll keep you posted.  Sheryl.

PG&E ES had indicated that they made quite a few changes to the MSA.  Are
these incorporated in the latest draft?

The response from Richard is that we are happy with UK courts so long as our 
counterparty is in the UK, but if we have a counterparty on the continent and 
there is any chance that submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of UK 
courts might not be fully enforced in the counterparty's country, we should 
go to arbitration.  In other words, we would prefer arbitration to ending up 
in court in a jurisdiction in Europe.

Let's add this to the list of topics to discuss when I'm in London.

Thanks,

Subject: UK Courts vs. Arbitration for UK Swap Agreements

Richard:

In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration 
in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to 
judges or, God forbid, juries.  In Canada we are continuing to submit to the 
jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in 
civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts 
generally).  As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap 
agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK 
agreements.  Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts 
(where there are no juries in civil actions).  Should this continue to be our 
policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?  I 
would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely 
enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it.

Thanks,

Mark

Alan:

Regarding the legal comments below:

My impression was that the Joe had settled the choice of law issue:  i.e. the 
umbrella documents (Password Application and Electronic Trading Agreement) 
will be identical to those used in North America containing a New York choice 
of law provision.  These agreements have been approved by local counsel in 
Japan.  This is till my recommendation unless the commercial team decides 
that a document governed by Japanese law is essential.  As is the case for 
all EnronOnline trading, the online GTC's governing various commodities 
contain an appropriate choice of law for that product (e.g. English law for 
UK gas, New York law for US derivatives, etc.) regardless of where the 
counterparty is situated.  When a Japanese product is offered, I would assume 
that you will create a GTC governed by Japanese law, but last I heard that 
bridge is still ahead of us.

I don't know what the "international contracts" are that Rousseau refers to.  
There is no standard agreement for online trading.  The ETA provides that if 
a counterparty and the relevant Enron entity have a master agreement in place 
(such as an ISDA Master Agreement for derivatives trading [is this what 
Rousseau had in mind?]) such master will control the relevant transactions.  
The choice of law in that master would be the subject of negotiation at the 
time the master was signed.

In summary, unless the commercial team has changed its mind on the documents, 
the legal side of things is ready to go.

Hi John

I was wondering whether you could clarify the following additional issues:

* Legal
I'm not comfortable that the legal/contract situation is being sorted out. 
Mario mentioned that there is still some debate as to whether the contracts 
should be under Japanese or US law etc... This was something that they were 
debating about 3 weeks ago.

My understanding was that international contracts would be used. These are 
contracts that trading houses and investment banks would already be familiar 
with. Could you clarify the exact nature of the hold-up and get a date by 
which they will finalise this issue. The name of the legal guy is Mark 
Taylor. I'd like to contact him directly some time to make sure everything is 
progressing as planned (after all, if we don't have the contracts ready, 
noone can trade)

* Help desk
It is not a good idea to totally rely on the Houston help desk for EOL 
(especially during Japanese business hours). It took them about 4 minutes to 
get a translator. Using the translator was time consuming (also remember, 
international call), the translator was quite rude....and, in any case, I 
agree that there should be some support on the ground (demonstrate Enron 
commitment to Japan)

Please feel free to give me a call. I'm at the Okura on +81 3 3582 0111

Subject: Re: EnronOnline - Japan

Joe,

After extensive probing I discovered that the marketing materials EOL has 
planned cannot be delivered in time for our plans.  I can think of a number 
of alternatives for addressing this problem, including: changing brochures to 
one that can be more easily produced, changing printing firms and/or 
locations, and delaying the launch date until the following week.  

At least one person at EOL suggested that we have a "press conference" on May 
10 and then send out the materials.  I do not think this is an acceptable 
approach because it wastes the opportunities from the Nikkei interview on 
April 10, the higher profile McDonald/Hirl interviews during last week of 
April and buzz from counterparties receiving the packet.

There appears to be a pervasive misunderstanding of our strategy and 
timelines.  To correct this, I have asked for a meeting with all of the 
interested parties (except Louise) on Monday afternoon.  We WILL walk through 
every step of the marketing plan and ensure that we have buy-in and 
accountable parties for the parts of the process that are outside of the 
control of Enron Japan.  After the meeting, I will let you know where we 
stand and what we can reasonably expect.  If we cannot resolve everything, 
I'll confer with you before taking it up with Louise.

John

PS Please note the following exchange.  Please let me know if you want for me 
to soften my position.

Dave,

I understand that the meeting has been set for 2:00 p.m. on Monday in your 
office.  I look forward to our getting together to nail down the details 
while there is still an opportunity to make necessary adjustments. 

On the subject of cover letters, there are several reasons for our approach:
Given the urgency of completing the necessary pieces of the  mailing, it is 
more expedient to include two letters than to go through approvals on a new 
joint letter.
We want our counterparties to understand that there are two avenues of 
communication into Enron - EnronOnline (initially in English) for its 
e-commerce platform and Enron Japan for a host of Japan specific business 
lines.  It is important that we position them as separate but complementary.  
It's very easy for people in this market to confuse multifaceted business 
interests.  To be effective, we need to direct them to the appropriate 
sources/authorities.
At this point EnronOnline will only be available in English, so potential 
users would need to be able to read your letter in English anyway.  
However, in following Japanese protocols, many of the packets will need to be 
sent to higher level officials, who would then pass the packet on to the end 
users.  These are the people that we need to notify of Enron's Tokyo office 
and that EnronOnline is one of the many products and services available 
through Enron.  It is essential that this higher audience have the name of 
just the top Enron official in Japan, otherwise they may think that they 
should bypass the Enron Japan office and always go to Houston.  (In this 
culture it is a real risk.)  This would  jeopardize Enron's strategy for 
Japan.

I hope the above mentioned considerations are helpful.  I look forward to 
discussing this further when we meet Monday.

John

Subject: Re: EnronOnline - Japan  

John,

It seems strange to me that we will not be translating the cover letter. This 
would mean that the cover letter is the only thing in the envelope which is 
not in Japanese?

Also, I'm wondering why we would have two cover letters. Would it not be 
better to combine the messages into one?

Perhaps we can discuss on Monday - I understand a conference call with the 
recipients of this email is being set up.

Mario,
We sent the translation to Kal yesterday afternoon, Japan time.  The cover 
letter is fine with us (we don't plan to translate it, since users can read 
English).  We plan to add another cover letter in Japanese from Hirl as 
well.  If, in addition to Kal, you need the translation too, please let me 
know.  I'll be back in the US next week if we need to discuss (I'll be 
calling Kal to ask about printing delivery dates).
Thanks,

John,

We were checking today the launch process for EOL in Japan. Could you please 
let us know the status of the Press Release and the translation of the 
"Getting Started", the ball brochure and the cover letter? Is there an 
expected date for the completion of the translation?

Thanks in advance,

Rousseau:

I have copied you on an e-mail to Alan Aronowitz which may answer your 
questions.  If not, please feel free to call and we can discuss your issues.  
If I am not at hand when you call, my assistant can book a particular time on 
my calendar so we won't be trading calls forever.

MarkMark K thought the play sounded like a good idea so if you could get tickets 
for us that would be great.  My flight out isn't until around 11:00 Friday 
morning so I can always stay up late to chat!  I'll be there Thursday 
morning, too - I'm supposed to attend a lecture at 11 but am free before that 
- any Chemistry classes or labs I should sit in on?

MarkAny further news from Russia?  There's a good chance I'll have to go to DC 
for a day tomorrow & if they're back I might be able to get up there to see 
them - I could try and get an early enough flight tomorrow afternoon that I 
could spend the evening with them.FYI

What do you think?  OK with me, although I think I'm supposed to leave for 
South America on Sunday evening (gone 5 days or so - this is the trip that 
has been postponed twice already so I won't be surprised if it is delayed 
again).

G & I were discussing having a Sunday afternoon cocktail party next Sunday
(Palm Sunday, April 16).  Considering it is kind of last minute, and it is
Palm Sunday weekend, we wanted to take a quick poll:

Question:
If we planned a gathering between 2pm-5pm on Sunday would you be able to
attend.

Thanks for your help.

MRC
We have an opening for a paralegal in the Financial Trading group.  In the 
past we have been very successful with referrals from members of the Legal 
Dept. who know of paralegals with whom they have worked in local law firms 
who might be willing to move.  Please give this a little thought and if you 
know of a good paralegal in town, let me or Tana Jones know so we can contact 
them.

Thanks for you help.

MarkAllison -  I don't think they were expecting Cynthia to attend these meetings 
with me - there will only be one representative from each of the three 
companies.  I did want her to know what meetings had been set up for me 
though and to know I was in town that day in case she wanted me to see anyone 
else.  My flight out isn't until after 7:00 pm. and I assume that the Luken 
meeting will be over around 3:00.

G & I were discussing having a Sunday afternoon cocktail party next Sunday
(Palm Sunday, April 16).  Considering it is kind of last minute, and it is
Palm Sunday weekend, we wanted to take a quick poll:

Question:
If we planned a gathering between 2pm-5pm on Sunday would you be able to
attend.

Thanks for your help.

Mario -

We have conducted our initial legal due diligence for the EnronOnline launch 
in Japan.  The advice we have received is that to the extent the agreements 
are enforceable under the law chosen (e.g. New York for the PA and ETA) they 
should be enforceable in Japan as well.  Local counsel is aware of our 
business and has not identified any other legal pitfalls.  We have not looked 
into the registration of domain names in Japan.  Please let me know if this 
is required.

Subject: EnronOnline Japan

Mark,

We identified some matters (listed below) related to EnronOnline launch in 
Japan. Please advise.

Are there issues to be addressed on:
  - the compliance with local corporate requirements to trade the products 
currently available in EOL?
  - the determination of issues surrounding electronic trading 
(enforceability)?
  - unanticipated regulatory impacts (both local and international trading)?
  - the registration of internet domain names in the local jurisdiction?
  - the compliance with local documentation requirements?
  - the compliance with local Trade Practices Act?

Thanks in advance,

Mario Parra Cardoso

Thanks for your note - I am actually checking my e-mail with my laptop at the 
airport in Minneapolis.  I was in DC on Wednesday (too bad Tim & Sharon 
aren't back) and then flew on to Monmouth (well, flew most of the way - the 
closest airport is still a bit over an hour drive away) for a capital 
campaign planning committee meeting.  Mark Kopinski was there and he and I 
had dinner with Dr. Kieft (our fraternity advisor and one of my chem. 
professors) who is still teaching.  I'm now on my way back to Houston - 
flight delayed but shouldn't be getting back too late.  Hope you are well.

Love,

MarkAre you sure about this?  I didn't know I had a NY bar number.

Robbi:

The CFTC issued a Regulatory Framework for some new regulations in late 
February, a copy of which is attached.  No proposed regulations have resulted 
but could come out at any time now.  There is also some activity on the Hill 
(bills percolating through various committees: House Banking, House 
Agriculture and Senate Agriculture) which are also of interest.  We have been 
monitoring these developments and I'd be happy to talk them over with you.  
Please give me a call if you'd like at x37459.

The PA and ETA for Japanese counterparties will be identical to those for

Subject: Feedback--Legal Checklist

Gentlemen,

We have put together a template to help with the conceptualization of 
eBusiness opportunities for the Enron Net Works Group.
This is a broad attempt to put some structure around the multitude of issues 
that must be addressed to validate and correctly 
conceive these ventures (in addition to reducing redundancy).

In regards to the legal analysis that must be conducted, I have attached the 
relevant excerpt below.  Essentially, the list is to help 
internal sponsors and managers understand the issues at hand prior to and 
during the formation of these businesses, and 
be able to talk to legal experts such as yourselves about the business' role 
in the context of material legal issues.  I would 
appreciate your comments--any and all are welcome.  

Potentially, triggers or thresholds for "classification" may be relevant, but 
I defer to your judgement those issues that may be of 
relevance to the non-legal businessperson.  I look forward to your responses.

Regards,
Darren Maloney

Subject: Windows 2000 Roll Out

Hi Ladies!

As you know, we are planning to roll out Windows 2000 in early May.  This 
will require upgrading our computer equipment with what is "necessary" to run 
Windows 2000, including new CPUs for most of us.  Although I haven't seen 
Windows 2000 yet, I am told that there are very few changes, the most 
significant one being that we will be using Lotus Notes for calendar 
purposes.  (Organizer goes away.)  We are told that with 1 hour of training 
everyone should be up to speed!

Could you please take a moment to answer the following questions? 

Do you or your assignments have a Palm Pilot? NO

Do you or your assignments have an "Enron" purchased computer at home? NO

Do you or your assignments have any personal software you have loaded? YES

Do you or your assignments save any files to your C: drive? YES

Do you or your assignments save any files to your H: drive? YES


I need this information as quickly as possible.  Also, please let me know if 
you are planning any vaction time during the month of May so we can start 
scheduling training.

THANKS FOR YOUR HELP!

Trading Alert 3:PM

We are concerned about the Asian markets tonight and how they
will react to Brazil. We feel you should consider closing open
positions before the end of the day in case Asia self destructs tonight.

The U.S. markets have recovered strongly but are still showing signs
of further weakness. Time to be careful until a new market trend is
established.

Good Luck

Jim

Can't we just transfer the billing to me?

In your FAQ, you might like to outline the contract structure in some detail, 
for eg:

* the counterparty contracts with Enron North America re: PA
* contracts with ENA re: ETA and 
* contracts with Singapore re: GTC

Was there any particular reason that you chose the PA to be with ENA rather 
than Enron Japan.  Note, Australia was done for the Australian market.

I would prefer to change it to Enron Japan. Will we have to receive further 
external advice? If not, I will change it accordingly.

Here are my FAQ comments - all of the existing answers are still correct.
Nedre:

We have interviewed four candidates so far and may be able to decide on one 
of them - the group will be meeting early next week to discuss everyone's 
reactions to the interviews.  If you have other resumes we would be happy to 
look at them - my own view is that while these candidates would be OK, they 
are not superstars (like the person we are losing).

Mark,

I was wondering how close you and your group are to making a decision
on the Paralegal position.   I know you have seen some candidates.  Would you 
like
to continue to see more or do you want to choose from the pool that you have 
already seen?

I haven't heard much feedback (evaluation sheets or email) from the 
interviewing group, and 
I need to know what you all think of the candidates.  Please let me know 
where we are at your 
earliest convenience.

Thanks,

My only remaining comment would be a request that the we have a week to 
provide the notice we are required to give if we are unable to obtain the 
exchange consents - that would mean changing the date to September 7, 2000  
at the end of the sentence.

Otherwise it all looks good to me.   I will forward everything on to Mark 
Holsworth for his final review - particularly with respect to the affiliates 
issue.

Thanks very much for your help in getting this done.

Enron/Reuters Working Group:

Attached are revised Order Forms and a revised Terms & Conditions.  Please 
note
the following changes:

References to "Enron Corporation" have been changed to "Enron Corp."

A termination right for the data portion of the transaction has been inserted 
in
the Order Form for data.

References to "Distributor's Subsidiaries" have been added in the license 
grant
in Section 4.1 of the T&C as well as in the indemnification section in Section
14 to extend the indemnification protection by Reuters to Distributor's
Subsidiaries.  Because of the wider scope of the license, a Section 16.10 has
been added to make clear that if any of Distributor's Subdiairies breach the
Agreement, Reuters will look to Enron Corp. rather than the individual
subsidiary.  The reason for this is that although Reuters acknowledges that
Enron's subsidiaries may be involved in operating the URLs, Reuters does not
want to be put in a situation in which it has to search for the relevant
subsidiary to remedy the breach.

Mark:
I hope the added language addresses your concern regarding the protection of
Enron's Affiliates and the ability of Affiliates to participate in the 
operation
of URLs.  Please call to discuss if necessary (646-298-9571).

Mark:

Here is the most recent draft of the Reuters document.  You will see that 
while they didn't give us everything we asked for, they made significant 
progress on the indemnity.  I'm not sure they have satisfied your concern 
regarding the Enron affiliates issues - they have added in subsidiaries in 
several places but refused to change the definition of "Distributor" to 
include affiliates.

If you need a complete set of all of the drafts we have been through (to see 
all of the marked changes) let me or Dave Samuels know and we can forward 
them to you (I think there were at least 4 versions since the draft we 
discussed with them the other day).

Since I will be in Brazil on Monday, it might make sense for you to 
coordinate your reactions with Dave.  If you need me, please leave a 
voice-mail or ask  my assistant (Taffy x57373) to track me down.

Hi Dave:

Thanks for your note!  It's hard to believe that Washington House was over 
twenty years ago now.  I left DC at the end of that summer and went to law 
school in Michigan.  My first job after graduating was for a law firm in 
Houston.  They opened a New York office in the mid 80's and I went there to 
help out.  The office wasn't successful but I loved living in New York so I 
moved to another firm there and stayed for almost 8 years total.  One of 
those years was spent working in Asia - primarily Indonesia and Hong Kong.  
I've now moved back to Houston where I am a lawyer with Enron - a large 
energy company - and focus on derivatives and online trading legal issues.  
We have offices in several countries around the world which I get to visit 
periodically.  I'm actually writing this from Buenos Aires where I'm helping 
them get some products ready to trade online.  I get back to Washington a 
couple of times a year to do some lobbying for the company and may actually 
have been there when you were in town - I think I was there the 11th & 12th.

I've stayed in touch with Doc Kieft and Mark Kopinski and get back to M.C. 
from time to time.  Mark lives in New York where he manages a couple of 
international mutual funds for American Century.  I was on the Alumni Board 
for a few years so got back for their meetings at Homecoming and got to see 
the people who came back - unfortunately I haven't really stayed in touch 
very well.  There have been a number of changes to the campus since our time 
so you may be surprised if you haven't been back for a while - of course 
Woodbine is gone, there's a new theater, a big addition to the gym and 
several major interior renovations.  And I understand there are big plans for 
more - they are going to close Sixth Street, tear down Gibson and expand the 
campus a block to the west with at least one new dorm, a big expansion to the 
sports facilities (indoor track, pool, etc.) and a redesign of the library.  
Enrollment is up above 1000.

Congratulations on your successful career - who would have thought when we 
got out of school so many years ago that Monmouth grads could do this well!  
There are doctors, bankers, chemists and lawyers everywhere you look.  I 
guess we really did learn something while we were there.

Let me know if you ever get to Texas.  It would be fun to get together and 
catch up.

The Nightmare on Wall Street, Starring China, Brazil, Argentina and
others.


I woke up with a terrible nightmare this morning. I dreamed that
the S&P Futures were limit down -27 and the Dow futures were down
-300. The bad news - it was not a nightmare, it was real life.

If you don't live in a closet you know by now that the Brazil
counterpart to Alan Greenspan resigned and Brazil devalued its
currency. The worst possible of all global scenarios. But wait!
Is that another dip to buy?

After opening down -266 on the Dow and -113 on the Nasdaq, the worst
was over before it started. The CNBC hype undoubtedly contributed
to the massive sell off because as soon as buyers could get into
the market we moved immediately off the panic lows.

I am not saying this is not a problem but as I said last night I
thought Brazil had already been discounted in the market. The
rapid bounce back has proven this to some extent. Several analysts
said several months ago that we could expect -500 to -600 if Brazil
devalued. Since it did not happen it shows the strength of the
current bull market.

I went on record last night that I did not think we were starting
a correction and the bull was just resting. Was I worried this
morning? You bet! But I was also greatly relieved when I saw the
buyers come back to work. Think about it. What else can happen
that could be worse than this? Nothing I can imagine. Sure the
Asian connection to Brazil will be tested tonight and we are still
faced with the domino theory in South America, but again, I think
the worst is already discounted. As soon as investors realize that
Latin America did not sink beneath the ocean and the IMF is not
going to let the eighth largest economy in the world sink, then
they will be putting that cash back to work.

The volume this morning was not bad. The volume on the recovery
this afternoon was great. The Nasdaq did almost 1.2 billion shares
again and the NYSE over 900 mil. The market is expecting earnings
by the dozens next week and appears ready to rumble.

Intel broke with the pack early and starred in the recovery adding
+3.44 for the day. Microsoft, SunMicro and almost anything tech
shook off the news and powered forward. SunMicro was up over $10
at one point on takeover rumors by IBM. IBM announced they were
raising over $4 bil in new cash today which was earmarked in part
for acquisitions. Microsoft and Dell were up strongly at midday
but caved in at the close.

Traders fear of darkness was apparent as the Dow backslid from
-35 to -125 and the Nasdaq turned slightly negative at the close.
The fear of course comes from going to bed with profits and
waking up the next day to surprises from Asia like we had from
Brazil this morning. Tonight will tell the tale. If Asia does
not melt and the politicians in Brazil work their magic and say
the words analysts want to hear then it is off to the races again.

At the risk of repeating myself too much, there just seems to be
nothing that can derail this market. I took a bloodbath this morning
but when I saw it was not going to get worse I jumped back in and
got some bargains at really good prices. As evidenced by the quick
bounce there were other blue light shoppers there as well.

The VIX settled at 31 after being as high as 35.48 and appears
to confirm the worst to be over.

Apple Computer easily beat the street estimates tody after the
close and more strong earnings are due out soon from MSFT, IBM,
SUNW, SLR, etc. All are expected to do well. No skeletons in the
U.S. economy so look for continued movement upward barring any
sympathy crashes overseas tonight.

Good Luck

Jim Brown
