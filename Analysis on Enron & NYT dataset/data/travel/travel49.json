That rate includes fishing with a licensed captain and crew, fishing licenses, airport transfers, breakfast and lunch daily, use of tackle and rain gear and packing of your catch to airline specifications.

The 565-room hotel reopened Sunday, following a more lavish, costly and, ultimately, efficient refurbishment than originally planned. ''Because we had to close, we were able to get everything done at once,'' said Jan Larsen, the hotel's general manager. From the outside, the 55-story tinted-glass tower opposite the World Trade Center site looks much the same. But while the interior displays the soothing colors and contemporary furniture that business travelers favor, return guests won't see much they recognize. The spacious lobby, which retains the hotel's original lacquered wood walls, features a fleet of sleek yellow sofas opposite a glamorous bar and lounge. A floor above, regional American food is the specialty of Church & Dey, a handsome, light-filled restaurant with a hand-painted mural. Rooms outfitted in restful celadon and cream command river and skyline views. Amenities include 42-inch plasma screen televisions, high-speed Internet connections and glass-topped desks on castors in the guest rooms and, for fitness enthusiasts, a window-lined exercise room and lap pool. The Millenium Hilton is at 55 Church Street. For reservations call (212) 693-2001. This month the hotel is offering a special rate of $199.
