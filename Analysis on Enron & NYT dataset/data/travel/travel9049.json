The ski resorts around Lake Tahoe in California and Nevada have been inundated. But the heavy snowfalls have also resulted in some difficulties: roads from Salt Lake City to the slopes have been closed at times, and some roofs in Durango, in southwest Colorado, have collapsed under the snow. Ski operators in the West say they hope to remain open for one to three weeks longer than usual, but for just how long depends on how many skiers show up. \"Having surplus snow is one thing, but it's not cost-effective to keep the lifts and other facilities going if there are too few skiers,\" said an official at Keystone in Colorado. Keystone, like Copper, Breckenridge and Arapahoe Basin, is in Summit County, Colorado's highest and, county officials say, snowiest county. The resorts could keep lifts going until late April, and Arapahoe might continue into May, a spokesman said.
