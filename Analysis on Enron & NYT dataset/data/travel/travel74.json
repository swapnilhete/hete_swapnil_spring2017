Southwest's move into Philadelphia, a hub where fares have traditionally been significantly higher than the national average, is a direct challenge to US Airways, which has about 195 daily departures from Philadelphia, while its subsidiary US Airways Express has about 180. US Airways is preparing to lower fares in Philadelphia as Southwest arrives. ''Southwest is coming to Philadelphia in May,'' David Siegel, the US Airways chief, said in a videoconference last week. ''They're coming for one reason. They're coming to kill us.'' CARBS ARE THE LAST TO GO -- If you're on an airplane that still serves food, ever wonder why the eggs breakfast choice is often unavailable, but there's plenty of cereal left by the time the meal cart gets to the back of the plane? The explanation: an estimated 32 million Americans are on some kind of low-carbohydrate diet. And the travel industry has begun responding. Lufthansa plans to begin testing low-carb menu options in business class in July on its routes between Germany and Los Angeles. Hyatt Hotels this month began offering low-carb restaurant, room-service and banquet menus at 100 properties in the United States.
