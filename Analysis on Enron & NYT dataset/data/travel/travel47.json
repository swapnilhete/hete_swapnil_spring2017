Eric Melgren, the United States attorney for Kansas, said that Chad Butler, 33, of Wichita, was indicted by a federal grand jury after being arrested Aug. 25. Mr. Butler resigned from his job, the T.S.A. said. Since April, about two dozen T.S.A. screeners have been charged with stealing from bags at airports in Detroit; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; New Orleans; New York; and Philadelphia. CONSUMER CLOUT -- Business-travel advocates played the antitrust card in pressuring Northwest Airlines to retreat from a $7.50 surcharge for tickets booked on travel agencies' reservations systems. Northwest dropped the fee late last week under pressure from travel groups, though the refusal of other airlines to adopt the surcharge also played a part. Northwest's planned surcharge for roundtrip tickets amounted to an ''anticompetitive practice'' by presenting ''a clear invitation to Northwest's competitors to follow its lead and agree to this across-the-board price increase,'' Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, had said in a letter to the Justice Department. Carol A. Devine, president of the National Business Travel Association, whose executives met with Northwest two days before the fee was dropped, hailed the fee's repeal. Northwest will still charge a $5 fee for tickets purchased on its telephone system and $10 for those bought at airport counters.", "headline": {"kicker": "BUSINESS TRAVEL", "main": "MEMO PAD"}, "_id": "4fd254dc8eb7c8105d7fc648", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/07/business/07memo.html", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "BUTLER, CHAD"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NORTHWEST AIRLINES CORPORATION"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DELTA AIR LINES INCORPORATED"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "DELTA AIR LINES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NORTHWEST AIRLINES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ROBBERIES AND THEFTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIRPORTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRICES (FARES, FEES AND RATES)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LUGGAGE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SECURITY AND WARNING SYSTEMS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MID-CONTINENT AIRPORT (WICHITA, KAN)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRAVEL AGENCIES AND AGENTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "AIRLINE FOOD -- Two years after free meals became largely a memory (good or bad) in the coach cabins of many domestic flights, American Airlines is considering joining competitors that started selling meals to passengers after eliminating free mea...", "section_name": "Business", "print_page": "7", "abstract": "American Airlines will begin testing in-flight food sales in September on selected flights; meals will cost $5 to $7; letter, sent to Congress under aegis of Air Transport Association and signed by chairmen of most domestic airlines, says fuel bill this year for nation's airlines at current prices will be $6 billion more than it would have been with last year's prices; Forecast International says Bombardier and Embraer will produce 387 regional jets this year, and that number will include 'progressively higher proportion of larger capacity aircraft' than in recent years; says production of 70-to-120-seat regional jets during next 10 years will be 'particularly dynamic'; construction has begun on $220 million terminal at Tan Son Nhut airfield in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, that will increase airport's capacity to as much as 17 million passengers each year; AAA is predicting 'potentially record high' travel over Labor Day weekend, including 11 percent increase from year earlier in number of air travelers, to $3.9 million (Memo Pad column) (M)", "type_of_material": "News", "subsection_name": null, "pub_date": "2004-08-31T00:00:00Z", "word_count": 560, "news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk", "byline": {"person": [{"rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "SHARKEY", "organization": "", "firstname": "Joe"}], "original": "By JOE SHARKEY"}, "multimedia": [], "blog": [], "lead_paragraph": "AIRLINE FOOD -- Two years after free meals became largely a memory (good or bad) in the coach cabins of many domestic flights, American Airlines is considering joining competitors that started selling meals to passengers after eliminating free meals during the post-9/11 slump in business. American said it would begin testing in-flight food sales in September on selected flights, including some between Dallas and New York and New York and Phoenix. Meals will cost $5 to $7. If the tests are successful and American expands the service throughout its domestic schedule, the airline, the world's largest, will join most major airlines and a handful of low-cost carriers in selling food in coach on some or all flights. (In business and first class, free meals are still the norm.) Among the major carriers, only Continental still serves free meals in coach on most domestic flights. FUEL PRICES -- The airlines insist they are not crying wolf about the trouble that high oil prices are causing. ''While the soaring price of fuel is a huge problem for the economy, it is rapidly becoming a catastrophe for the airline industry,'' according to a letter to Congress signed by the chairmen of most domestic airlines. The letter states that at current prices, the fuel bill this year for the nation's airlines will be $6 billion more than it would have been with last year's prices. The letter, sent under the aegis of the Air Transport Association, asks for oversight hearings to review the ''feverish speculation'' in oil markets. ''We are convinced,'' the letter says, ''that the only thing that will stop the wild increase in prices is fear by the speculators that the U.S. government is ready to step in with actions that could either increase supply or reduce demand.''", "headline": {"kicker": "BUSINESS TRAVEL", "main": "MEMO PAD"}, "_id": "4fd247f98eb7c8105d7e443a", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/31/business/business-travel-memo-pad.html", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "VIETNAM"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "EMBRAER"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AIR TRANSPORT ASSN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AMERICAN AIRLINES"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "AAA"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BOMBARDIER INC"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SALES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "OIL (PETROLEUM) AND GASOLINE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LABOR DAY"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRICES (FARES, FEES AND RATES)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TAN SON NHUT INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (VIETNAM)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "JET FUEL"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TRAVEL AND VACATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PRODUCTION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Terminal 2E at Charles de Gaulle International Airport partly reopened to commercial flights on Aug. 17, almost three months after the departure area collapsed on May 23, killing four people.
