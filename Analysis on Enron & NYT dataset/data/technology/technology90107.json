Instead, many threw their weight with Sir John Maddox, former editor of the journal Nature, who asserted, ''Nobody can tell what lies ahead.'' To the Editor: While Mr. Maddox raises issues regarding upcoming discoveries, there is an additional point regarding Mr. Horgan's view that we are nearing the end of science. The ''imminent'' discoveries that Mr. Horgan suggests will end our quest are all described in his book as 20-30 years away. Given the rapid pace of science, it is impossible to distinguish 30 years in the future from an infinite time in the future.", "headline": {"kicker": "RESOLVING THAT SCIENCE IS AT AN END?

He declared that the world, for its political survival, must find a new, shared system of transcendent values to replace the traditional religious beliefs that science has eroded. And he proposed to derive this new value system from a surprising source -- science itself. It's rare enough to hear a politician talk about transcendent values, rarer still one willing to lay out a plan for developing a new universal system. And it's especially notable that this man, who spent his life resisting one system that claimed universal validity, should seek so soon after the death of Communism to erect another. If his high arc above the mundane proves less than fully satisfying, it's because the scientific ideas he selected for his oracle have more elegance than substance.", "headline": {"main": "SUNDAY, August 14, 1994; A Fable for Fleas"}, "_id": "4fd1e65e8eb7c8105d7325a0", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/14/magazine/sunday-august-14-1994-a-fable-for-fleas.html", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "HAVEL, VACLAV"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Shutting Out the Wind   Q.
