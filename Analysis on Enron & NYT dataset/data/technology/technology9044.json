Until very recently, few loudspeaker designers or consumers could have imagined any other objective; and to the extent that some speaker companies veered from the imperative of musical truth, placing visceral impact above natural verity, their creations were dismissed as anomalous and perverse. But a sonic revolution has come in the name of home theater. Not only has the quest for acoustical truth been squelched, but the very nature of the real sound world has been deconstructed and replaced by the elaborate artifice of the movie soundtrack. Music has given place in the affections of consumers to the whiz and bang of cinematic special effects. That at least is the premise on which many speaker manufacturers have adopted the new ideal.

It is a reference point to keep in mind as the audio industry, exploiting the popularity of home theater, presses its advantage toward an ever wider market with ever smaller (and cheaper) surround-sound loudspeaker systems. In the new vogue for \"home theater in a box,\" one envisions a reductio ad absurdum: the visceral power of cinema sound diminished to the scale of a shoe box. There is much to be said for reducing the complexity, and the cost, of home theater systems. For serious hobbyists, who might be seen as the audio buffs of the multimedia age, a real home theater layout consists of a surround-sound processor and six-channel amplifier complemented by five high-performance loudspeakers, plus a subwoofer or two to make the trousers flap when helicopters swoop across the screen. The parts might come from three or four manufacturers and cost several thousand dollars.
