But the technique will not work for pork farmers, because pig sperm does not stand freezing, and artificial insemination is of limited use with horses, because horse sperm can be refrigerated only briefly. But now a Gulph Mills, Pa., company that specializes in commercializing biotechnology patents is working on a method of preserving sperm that requires no refrigeration. The company, British Technology Group USA, uses a polymer gel to encapsulate the sperm. At room temperature, the polymer solidifies, immobilizing the sperm and lowering their metabolic activity. The polymer is permeable, letting oxygen in and waste products out. Because it is encapsulated in the polymer, the sperm can be sent through the mail. In the case of cows and mice -- the only species for which the technology has been demonstrated so far -- the sperm can survive up to 21 days.", "headline": {"kicker": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY", "main": "Mail-Order Mates With a Biotech Twist"}, "_id": "4fd1c9958eb7c8105d6fcca7", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/13/business/business-technology-mail-order-mates-with-a-biotech-twist.html", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY PAGE (NYT)"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "BRITISH TECHNOLOGY GROUP"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REPRODUCTION (BIOLOGICAL)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BIOTECHNOLOGY"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "If it were not for gyroscopes, planes would lose their way, missiles would miss their targets and man would not have reached the moon.
