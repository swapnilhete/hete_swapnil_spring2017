If green is such a good camouflage color, why are there no green-colored mammals? A. Neither of those assumptions may be accurate, said James Doherty, general curator of the Bronx Zoo and chairman of the mammal department. In the first place, he said, \"Green is not necessarily all that good a camouflage color.\" Unless it is very dark, he said, it may be more obvious than other colors. Most mammals are probably color blind, he said, so dark green would come across as black, but a lighter green, depending on the brightness of the color, would come across as gray. Depending on the background, a light-colored animal might be more obvious to some predators, even if it was green, he said. In the second place, Dr. Doherty said, there are some green or at least greenish mammals, including the green monkeys of Africa, which are a greenish-olive color, and a small South American rodent called the acouchi, a very dark animal with a greenish color. The green monkey is light in color, but it is not a deep-forest animal where a dark color would help it disappear, he said. Instead, it lives in an area with a lot of light and grass. \"But their predators probably don't see color anyway,\" Dr. Doherty said. Melanoma in Albinos Q. Can a human albino get melanoma? A. Sometimes, said Dr. John J. Di Giovanna, a dermatologist at the National Cancer Institute. He said there were at least 10 different types of albinism, or impairment of melanocytes, the skin cells that produce the pigment melanin. Most albinos do have melanocytes, even if they are not making pigment, he said. Albinos can develop a kind of melanoma called amelanotic melanoma, or melanoma in the absence of pigment. As long as melanyocytes are present, they can develop a malignancy that may be unrelated to the impairment of the function of making melanin, he said. And in some albinos, where the ability to make the pigment is impaired, rather than totally absent, melanomas with pigment can occur, he said.", "headline": {"main": "Q&A"}, "_id": "4fd1b1628eb7c8105d6d3a6e", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/30/science/q-a-303490.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "LEAD:    Huck Finn's Drowning       Q.Was there a scientific basis for searching for drowning victims by floating loaves of bread containing quicksilver on the water, as the townspeople in Mark Twain's novel ''Huckleberry Finn'' did when they thou...", "section_name": "Technology; Science; Health", "print_page": "11", "abstract": null, "type_of_material": "Question", "subsection_name": null, "pub_date": "1990-04-17T00:00:00Z", "word_count": 518, "news_desk": "Science Desk", "byline": null, "multimedia": [], "blog": [], "lead_paragraph": "LEAD: Huck Finn's Drowning Q.Was there a scientific basis for searching for drowning victims by floating loaves of bread containing quicksilver on the water, as the townspeople in Mark Twain's novel ''Huckleberry Finn'' did when they thought the hero had drowned?
