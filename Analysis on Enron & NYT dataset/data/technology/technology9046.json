With its new Powerstation 220 machine, the world's largest computer maker is playing catch-up at the low end of the work station market, analysts said. The low-cost, single-chip version of the RS/6000 work station family had been delayed for technical reasons and is still more expensive than similar machines from Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment and Hewlett-Packard. Indeed, a black-and-white version of the machine without a disk drive is priced starting at $6,345.
