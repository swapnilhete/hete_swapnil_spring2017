A friend and I were on the way to Mexico by car (Volkswagen bus, in fact, de riguer in those days), when I came across the famous cured country hams I had read about, hanging in a shop in Tennessee. I couldn't resist buying one, with the result that the two of us sat down for an Easter dinner that consisted of a ham weighing more than 16 pounds. For the next few days we cheerfully tucked into ham sandwiches, but they barely made a dent in our enormous country ham. It didn't take long before our daily ration of the stuff was no longer a pleasure, but a baleful reminder of my extravagance. I began thinking of every conceivable way of finishing up the ham: stuffing it into enchiladas, dousing it with chilis, submerging chunks of it in stews, poaching it with Mornay sauce and hiding it under eggs.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Italian Dishes Make Good Use of the Leftover Ham"}, "_id": "4fd1bc8b8eb7c8105d6e7daf", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/31/nyregion/food-italian-dishes-make-good-use-of-the-leftover-ham.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "LEAD: NO one thinks twice about buying chicken in parts, but few places will sell you duck legs or breasts separately.
