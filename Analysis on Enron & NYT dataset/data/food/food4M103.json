These casseroles ''conduct heat beautifully, and yet they're elegant enough to go into the dining room,'' said David Waltuck of Chanterelle, which uses them (left). The black matte finish gives the pots a cast-iron look, but heavy enamel actually covers the cast iron. The pots are rustproof and need no seasoning. The lids have brass knobs, and studs on the underside encourage cooking juices to condense onto the surface of the food, automatically basting it. The pots range from one cup to 12 1/2 quarts. Sur La Table in Manhasset, N.Y., and around the country sells the cookware, which is $29.95 for the one-cup version to $235.95 for an eight-quart size. It can be ordered from (800) 243-0852, www.surlatable.com or from Staub, which carries the entire line and whose prices are slightly lower. Green, blue, yellow and purple casseroles are available from Staub, (866) 782-8287 and can be special-ordered from Sur La Table.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD STUFF", "main": "A Dutch Oven From France Turns a Home Into a Hearth"}, "_id": "4fd237d28eb7c8105d7cab1c", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/19/dining/food-stuff-a-dutch-oven-from-france-turns-a-home-into-a-hearth.html", "keywords": [], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Blowfish tails are often sold under the names sea squab or chicken of the sea, though the odd-looking delicacies have nothing to do with birds.

This has been a good season for blowfish, found off Long Island's south shore and the north New Jersey coast. The tails are delicious morsels, with a single slender bone running their length. But few markets in Manhattan sell them because, the owners say, few people buy them and many do not even know what they are. I cook them like jumbo shrimp, dusting them with flour before saut\u00e9ing in butter and garlic, or I briefly sear the tails on the grill. Sometimes I add them to paella or bouillabaisse. There are about 20 to a pound, and they cost $6 to $8 a pound. In Manhattan, they are often carried by Pescatore Seafood in the Grand Central Market, Catalano Fish in Eli's Manhattan and the Vinegar Factory; Rosedale; and Pisacane. In Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, look for the tails at Henry's Fish Market.
