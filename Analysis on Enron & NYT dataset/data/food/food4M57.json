Dry, mealy, sturdy as medieval armament. Didn't used to be. Those who knew how to cook them back in the day released their subtle flavor, tenderness and juice by simply saut\u00e9ing or grilling them quickly till they were nicely pink inside and had reached a temperature of 137 degrees Fahrenheit -- the point at which the government decreed that trichinosis is killed. Still, plenty of childhoods were spoiled with knife-breaking chops, as paranoid chefs and mothers cooked them beyond the Frank E. Campbell stage and well into cremation range. (Cookbooks often suggested that though 137 did kill the trichinosis, you should add a few degrees to be safe, and the ''to be safe'' limit mushroomed from 137 to 160 to 170. The old ''Joy of Cooking'' suggested 185.) But when not overcooked, there was nothing like them. Then in the late 70's, the saturated-fat police broke down the door, and pork sales declined as the country went mad for pasta and bread and something frighteningly called ''legumes.'' And the truth was, pork may have contained as much if not more bad fat than beef and lamb, and much more than the newly canonized icon of victual virtue, skinless white chicken meat. Such was the fevered belief in the fat-free religion that intimidated cooks seldom argued how numbingly boring that skinless chicken meat was -- hence the billions of recipes needed to enhance its flavor. In a Kubrickian twist, the goo needed to enliven chicken often turned out to add more fat to the dish than if you had prepared a slobbering old prime rib in the first place.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Belly Up"}, "_id": "4fd2341c8eb7c8105d7c50ac", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/07/magazine/food-belly-up.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MEAT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "SALAD in winter can take imagination.
