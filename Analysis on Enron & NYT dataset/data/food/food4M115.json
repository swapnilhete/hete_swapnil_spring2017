The result -- moist, rich and aromatic -- is excellent plain with a glass of sweet wine after dinner, or turned into French toast for breakfast. The olive oil comes from a company called Nudo, which supports a collection of small growers in Central Italy, and encourages the public to ''adopt'' an olive tree to help the farmers -- in return for tins of oil. Nudo Panettone, $25 plus shipping for 35.27 ounces, must be ordered by Dec. 19 for delivery before Christmas, from nudo-italia.com; if any are available after that date, they can be ordered for later delivery.
