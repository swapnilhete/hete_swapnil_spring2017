You don't have to be Kevin Phillips to appreciate that the one quality Americans admire most is the same one they resent the most: other people's wealth. Take Michael Bloomberg, both Presidents Bush, Senators Kerry and Edwards and the self-appointed pooh-bah Trump: your average citizen (me included) dreams of, obsesses about or at least pines for being as wealthy as any one of them. At the same time, we luxuriate in their public downfall, on the assumption that they deserve it because they are wealthy. Mayor Bloomberg is, by definition, ''out of touch'' because he is wealthy; H.W. was out of touch because he was so wealthy that he didn't know what a grocery scanner was (despite the fact that most of us yearn to be so out of touch that we never have to know what a grocery scanner is); W. may be in touch, but it's the wrong kind of touch because of his wealth.

Normally the shop doesn't bother with individuals, but one of the owners had a young son named Jason and made an exception in my case. The table in the country is an old, somewhat battered reproduction of a round-topped table that might have been in use when the house was built in 1790 and was left behind by the previous owner when I bought the place in the 1960's. Until I was asked some years ago by a food magazine to write something about my kitchen I hadn't noticed what has since become obvious to me: these two kitchens bear a strong family resemblance, despite the different tabletops. It was as if I had designed them with a common ancestor in mind. For years, between marriages, I seldom visited the other rooms in my Long Island house, spending most of my time in the kitchen reading in a comfortable blue chair beside an old brick fireplace. I had what, in retrospect, seems to have been an aversion to the bedrooms upstairs to which, I imagined, foolishly, my grown children might someday return. I slept in a room off the kitchen. Only when more than six people came to dinner did I use the dining room, reluctantly, and still do. The same is true in the city. I prefer to read and write in the kitchen and almost never sit in the living room. This part of the apartment has always seemed off limits to me, like the front parlors of Victorian houses with their rubber plants, stuffed birds and antimacassars.

If Julia Child almost single-handedly brought serious French food into American homes, and Marcella Hazan brought other-than-meatballs Italian, and Jane Grigson miraculously salvaged some British food from unpalatability, then there is no question that Madhur Jaffrey not only changed the way this country views Indian food but also affected the way restaurants do, too -- more than anyone.
