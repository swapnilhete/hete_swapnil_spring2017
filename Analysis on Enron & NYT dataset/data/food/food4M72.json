I had heard about babies before Frank was born but hadn't had much business with them and considered them as dangerous to hold as porcupines (still do, sort of). At his birth, I concluded that he was unique -- and not by the standards of ''Rosemary's Baby.'' Had there ever been such fascinatingly tiny feet, intricately wrinkled fingers, ebullient smiles or riveting breathing while sleeping? I photographed and videotaped incessantly and still have a 40-minute tape of giving him a bath that would rival Warhol's ''Empire'' for numb-induction. I even submitted adorable head shots to modeling agents and, when he wasn't chosen, turned my back on show biz forever and deliberately sabotaged most of the scripts I was then writing. (Unfortunately, the studios decided it wasn't so deliberate.) I put his name up for Harrow and Eton and insisted that he be clothed by Rowe's of Bond Street, a ridiculously expensive store specializing in Spoiled Children's Clothes so fancy that they were suitable only for coronations -- and which were outgrown in a match strike.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Nut Cracking"}, "_id": "4fd227d48eb7c8105d7b0eaf", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/22/magazine/food-nut-cracking.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "CHESTNUTS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "In a recent issue of The New York Review of Books, there was an article on Middle Eastern food by the noted historian and Princeton professor Bernard Lewis, in which he quotes a 14th-century Persian writer on the subject of eggplant: ''One day whe...", "section_name": "Magazine", "print_page": "49", "abstract": "Julia Reed Food article on diverse recipes for eggplant; recipes; photo (M)", "type_of_material": "News", "subsection_name": null, "pub_date": "2002-07-28T00:00:00Z", "word_count": 1819, "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "byline": {"person": [{"rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "Reed", "organization": "", "firstname": "Julia"}], "original": "By Julia Reed"}, "multimedia": [], "blog": [], "lead_paragraph": "In a recent issue of The New York Review of Books, there was an article on Middle Eastern food by the noted historian and Princeton professor Bernard Lewis, in which he quotes a 14th-century Persian writer on the subject of eggplant: ''One day when Sultan Mahmud [reigned 998 to 1010] was hungry, they brought him a dish of eggplant. He liked it very much and said, 'Eggplant is an excellent food.' A courtier began to praise the eggplant with great eloquence. When the sultan grew tired of the dish he said, 'Eggplant is a very harmful thing,' whereupon the courtier began to speak in hyperbole of the harmful qualities of the eggplant. 'Man alive,' said the sultan, 'have you not just now uttered the praises of eggplant?' 'Yes,' said the courtier, 'but I am your courtier and not the eggplant's courtier.''' I come to you today as the eggplant's courtier. I love it. I love it in the Greek moussaka, the Proven\u00e7al ratatouille and the Italian eggplant Parmesan. I love the Creole version stuffed with seafood and the Levantine baba gannouj. According to Alan Davidson's invaluable ''Oxford Companion to Food,'' eggplant originated in India and was first mentioned in a fifth-century-A.D. Chinese text on agriculture. I am grateful that so many cultures have since embraced it, although it took awhile. The Moors introduced it to Spain, and the Arabs introduced it to Italy, but until about 1400 most Europeans considered it inedible, grew it only as an ornamental plant and gave it derisive names. One of the many that stuck was eggplant, because the varieties first cultivated on the continent were purple or white in the shape of eggs. (Of course, these days the most plentiful variety, in the United States at least, is shaped more like a club foot.) I did see a perfectly egg-shaped white one at Houston's unsurpassed Central Market the other day. And the long, skinny Chinese and Japanese varieties, excellent for grilling split down the middle, studded with garlic, flesh side down, are now widely available.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Purple Passion"}, "_id": "4fd26a538eb7c8105d821c58", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/28/magazine/food-purple-passion.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "EGGPLANT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "A simple hamburger barely a half-inch thick, slightly charred at the edges and rare inside, embellished with only ketchup and a neat slice of Bermuda onion on a four-inch bun, awakens in me memories as compelling as those aroused by Marcel Proust'...", "section_name": "Technology; Magazine; Books", "print_page": "125", "abstract": "Richard Rayner article says Internet has revolutionized used-book business, matching supply and demand in scattered markets; says success of online used-book dealers has been hard on traditional neighborhood used-book stores, except for those like like Strand in New York that have developed their own Web sites; photos (L)", "type_of_material": "News", "subsection_name": null, "pub_date": "2002-06-09T00:00:00Z", "word_count": 1794, "news_desk": "Magazine Desk", "byline": {"person": [{"rank": 1, "role": "reported", "lastname": "Epstein", "organization": "", "firstname": "Jason"}], "original": "By Jason Epstein"}, "multimedia": [], "blog": [], "lead_paragraph": "A simple hamburger barely a half-inch thick, slightly charred at the edges and rare inside, embellished with only ketchup and a neat slice of Bermuda onion on a four-inch bun, awakens in me memories as compelling as those aroused by Marcel Proust's famous madeleine. My hamburger, however, evokes not the salons of Paris but a lakeside shack in Maine at dusk amid the August hum of crickets. To recall the fragrant pine walls and the hand-lettered sign on the canoe paddle above an immaculate screen door, as if painted fresh every day, fills me even now with vivid longing. Macnamara's shack occupied a well-lighted grass plot between the lake and the dirt road to Augusta in the village of Winthrop, where I spent a few boyhood summers during the war. That August we toiled until dusk in the hot fields picking snap beans that we stuffed into burlap sacks and tossed onto trucks for the cannery, which shipped them to the soldiers overseas. On Friday, when we were paid, still in our bib overalls and shoeless at the end of the day, we would paddle our canoes into town to spend our wages on hamburgers, Nehi and frozen Milky Ways. Our leftover nickels went into Macnamara's jukebox: Vera Lynn, Artie Shaw, Harry James. We were 14 that summer, our front teeth as yet too big for our sunburned faces, but we were old enough to paddle confidently home across the lake after dark. Convinced of our righteous cause, certain of victory and proud of our war work in the fields, we ate our hamburgers in the hazy twilight, under the bare bulbs strung over Macnamara's counter with its neat arrangement of ketchup bottles and pickle jars.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Burger Heaven"}, "_id": "4fd269ea8eb7c8105d8210d2", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/09/magazine/food-burger-heaven.html", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "RAYNER, RICHARD"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "STRAND BOOK STORE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COMPUTERS AND THE INTERNET"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "WITH autumn in full blaze, the suitable fruit choices no longer involve peaches, nectarines, strawberries or cherries.

For visiting chefs, particularly those from California, it's the vegetables and fruit. When the Silicon Valley chef David Kinch was invited to Le Bernardin this summer to cook for a group of food journalists at the behest of Eric Ripert, who had recently been dazzled by the food at Kinch's restaurant, Manresa, Kinch brought his own produce in a cooler rather than work with the iffy local and imported stuff. The lunch was going smoothly -- we swooned over the sweet-corn croquettes, we were tickled by the ravigote sauce on the scallop carpaccio with Stimpson surf clam and we all cheered the roast saddle of rabbit with prunes and candied Meyer-lemon peel. Then a martini glass filled with miniature orange sections and a chiffonade of mint was set down. Jaded eyebrows shot up around the table. How . . . quaint! I recalled the line a French chef once used following a salad by Alice Waters, the great pioneer of using local organic produce: ''That's not cooking. That's shopping.'' Then the 43-year-old Kinch explained that these were six varieties of mandarin, grown by a local retiree who has more than 200 kinds of citrus trees -- a ''fruit hobbyist.'' Each tiny bite was explosively distinct, complex and new. Who knew there were six kinds of mandarin orange? And what else was lurking in Kinch's culinary backyard? That curiosity carried me all the way to Santa Cruz, Calif., where, a few weeks later, I picked up Kinch at his home.
