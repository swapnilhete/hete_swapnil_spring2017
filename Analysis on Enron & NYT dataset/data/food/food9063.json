Gooseberries are not well known in the United States. But in Europe, particularly in northern countries where they thrive because the sun is not too hot, they are a popular summer fruit. In England they show up mainly in pies and are mixed with cream in a dish called Gooseberry Fool, which dates from the Middle Ages. Their tart flavor also goes well in sauces for game, ham, pork, chicken and mackerel. In Colonial America, gooseberries were frequently used for wine, pies and preserves, but by the 19th century they had all but disappeared.

Despite all the work, nothing can match a home wedding -- the intimacy, the warmth, the beauty, the memories -- not to mention the money saved by doing most of the work yourself.

Bucking the runoff from the Adirondacks to make their way upstream, the shad are propelled, writes Robert H. Boyle in \"The Hudson River\" by \"ancestral fury.\" On the river bank, meanwhile, their nemesis, the fishermen, seem caught in an equally instinctive dance as they mend their gill nets and sharpen their knives. The river men scrutinize the surface of the water for the swarms of caddis and shad flies that a warm sun brings. They sand pine planks for smoking the fish and scrub the flat tin drums on which the roe is fried. But mainly they study the river bank for the yellow forsythia and the white-budded shadbush that blossom when the water rises above 50, sending the shad in search of a flat, shallow spawning ground.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Boning Up on Shad"}, "_id": "4fd1e68b8eb7c8105d732f69", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/18/magazine/food-boning-up-on-shad.html", "keywords": [{"name": "glocations", "value": "HUDSON RIVER"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "SHAD (FISH)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FISH AND OTHER MARINE LIFE"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}], "meta": {"hits": 58936, "time": 86, "offset": 630}}, "status": "OK"}
