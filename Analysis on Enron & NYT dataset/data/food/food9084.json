Last year, in response to demands from some growers and food processers, the United States Customs Service proposed that the packaging of frozen food containing imported produce be required to have a label on its front showing the country of origin. Current law requires such a label, but not necessarily on the front. Typically, wording like ''product of Mexico'' appears in small print on the back, or may even be stamped in runny ink on the side of the package, even though the regulation requires that the label be conspicuous. United Foods, which makes Pict Sweet frozen foods and uses no imported produce, lobbied for the new rule. But during the two-month comment period, its submission was the only one to argue for the proposal. The agency received 55 formal objections from food companies, importers and the Frozen Food Institute, a trade group, complaining that labeling was already required and that the new labeling would be expensive and too complicated to apply to items like mixed vegetables, which can come from more than one source. The Customs Service withdrew the proposal in February.", "headline": {"kicker": "Food Notes", "main": "Food Notes"}, "_id": "4fd1dee68eb7c8105d72383e", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/27/garden/food-notes-805009.html", "keywords": [{"name": "organizations", "value": "CUSTOMS SERVICE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND WORLD MARKET"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FROZEN FOODS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LABELING AND LABELS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FOOD"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "Haagen-Dazs Margaritas       Haagen-Dazs has introduced a margarita sorbet that tastes just like a frozen margarita.
