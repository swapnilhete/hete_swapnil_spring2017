In one of her dispatches, Elaine, who is from Georgia, reported that her grandmother had two biases about food: roast beef had to be cooked until it fell apart, and she couldn't abide collard greens. To her, Elaine wrote, ''collards were worse than useless, and any house where they had been cooked had to be burned to the ground. She was a turnip-greens woman.'' I didn't know it at the time, but my own mother, until recently, was one, too. (She grew up in Nashville, a place described in ''Nashville: Personality of a City'' as ''the turnip-greens and hog-jowl center of the universe.'' Alfred Leland Crabb writes, ''These two were used in fitting combination . . . by 1810, and the townspeople's appetite for them has not waned.'') I discovered her allegiance this year when I was appointed cook for Thanksgiving and called her from the produce aisle to ask how many people were coming so I'd be sure to get enough collards. ''Collards?'' she roared with such disgust I almost dropped my cellphone. ''They are tough and, well, just awful.'' I responded that I had recently eaten some of my friend Robert Carter's braised collards at the superlative Peninsula Grill in Charleston, S.C., and that they were some of the most delicious things I had ever tasted. She was unimpressed and told me that I had best bring home some turnip and mustard greens too.", "headline": {"kicker": "FOOD", "main": "Green Party"}, "_id": "4fd2491b8eb7c8105d7e6668", "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/11/magazine/food-green-party.html", "keywords": [{"name": "subject", "value": "TURNIPS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COOKING AND COOKBOOKS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "RECIPES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "COLLARD GREENS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MUSTARD GREENS"}], "source": "The New York Times", "slideshow_credits": null}, {"document_type": "article", "snippet": "The first time I interviewed Tammy Wynette, I was greeted at the kitchen door by her fifth husband, George Richey, who was in the process of making sausage with biscuits and gravy, a classic combination.

Cream gravy looks a little too much like cat throw-up to me, but the sausage was good and so were the biscuits, and I was impressed that Richey, who is also a talented producer and songwriter, was doing his own cooking. (He was, too -- when he checked the biscuits through the oven window, he grinned and said, ''Oh, yeah, those are gonna be award winners right there.'') There has long been a connection between country music and country sausage. The Louvin Brothers recorded the jingle for the Tennessee Pride brand almost 50 years ago; these days a new version can be heard at the Grand Ole Opry every Saturday night.

Academy voters take note. According to the tough British food writer Jane Grigson, Stargazy pie (sometimes spelled ''Stargazey'') is a Cornish creation traditionally made on Tom Bawcock's Eve, two days before Christmas, commemorating the night on which brave Bawcock went to sea to find sustenance for his foodless hometown of Mousehole. Against all odds he returned with netfuls of sardines, fed the town with this pie and wound up with a dish and an extremely minor holiday named after him.

With the exceptions of Jane Grigson and Elizabeth David, that nation's approach to the worthy leaf has been to boil it till it's about the feel and flavor of a deflated basketball. Cabbage smells up the kitchen, looks pathetic, kids don't like it and, in Grigson's words, it can ''ruin a meal with its wet flab.'' Unfortunately, her and David's solutions haven't been satisfactory either; rather than revealing its rich and subtle flavors, they tend to weigh it down with a mask of bacons, butters, cheeses and creams, chestnuts, sausages and, in the case of David's gros chou far\u00e7i \u00e0 la Proven\u00e7ale, a sheep's brain. The Germans haven't been much help either, customarily stuffing the thing with an entire pig, lots of ground beef and potatoes. Eastern Europeans get to the point much quicker: after steaming it for five minutes, they sandwich barbells between the leaves.
